                                CONTENTS


  O, where is my little dog gone?
  Young lambs to sell
  Three blind mice
  Little Polly Flinders
  There came to my window
  Over the hills and far away
  Where are you going to, my pretty maid?
  London Bridge has broken down
  I had a little nut tree
  Polly put the kettle on




                    OH! WHERE IS MY LITTLE DOG GONE?


  Oh! where is my little dog gone?
    Oh where, oh where can he be?
  With his ears cut short and his tail cut long,
    Oh, where, oh, where can he be?

                     [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]




                          YOUNG LAMBS TO SELL


  Young Lambs to sell! Young Lambs to sell!
    Young Lambs to sell! Young Lambs to sell!
  If I’d as much money as I could tell
    I would not come here with young Lambs to sell.
        Two for a penny, eight for a groat,
        As fine young Lambs as ever were bought.

                     [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]




                            THREE BLIND MICE


  Three blind mice—see how they run!
  They all ran after the farmer’s wife,
  Who cut off their tails with the carving knife,
  Did you ever hear such a tale in your life
          As three blind mice?

                     [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]




                         LITTLE POLLY FLINDERS


  Little Polly Flinders
  Sat among the cinders
    Warming her pretty little toes.
  Her mother came and caught her,
  And smacked her little daughter
    For spoiling her nice new clothes.

                     [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]




                        THERE CAME TO MY WINDOW


  There came to my window one morning in Spring
  A sweet little Robin; she came there to sing.
  The tune that she sang, it was prettier far
  Than any I heard on the flute or guitar.

  Her wings she was spreading to soar far away,
  Then resting a moment seemed sweetly to say:
  “Oh happy, how happy the world seems to be!
  Awake, Little Girl and be happy with me!”

  But just as she finished her beautiful song,
  A thoughtless young man with a gun came along.
  He killed and he carried my sweet bird away,
  She no more will sing at the dawn of the day.

                     [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]




                      OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY


  Tom he was a piper’s son,
  He learnt to play when he was young;
  But all the tune that he could play
  Was—“Over the hills and far away.”
    Over the hills and a great way off
    The wind shall blow my top-knot off!

  Tom with his pipe made such a noise
  That he pleased both the girls and boys;
  And they stopped to hear him play
  “Over the hills and far away.”
    Over the hills and a great way off
    The wind shall blow my top-knot off.

                     [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]




                “WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO, MY PRETTY MAID”


  “Where are you going to, my pretty maid?”
  “Where are you going to, my pretty maid?”
  “I’m going a-milking, Sir,” she said,
  “Sir,” she said, “Sir,” she said,
  “I’m going a-milking, Sir,” she said.

  “May I go with you, my pretty maid?”
  “You’re kindly welcome, Sir,” she said, etc.

  “What is your father, my pretty maid?”
  “My father’s a farmer, Sir,” she said, etc.

  “What is your fortune, my pretty maid?”
  “My face is my fortune, Sir,” she said, etc.

  “Then I can’t marry you, my pretty maid,”
  “Nobody asked you, Sir,” she said, etc.

                     [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]




                      LONDON BRIDGE IS BROKEN DOWN


  1. London Bridge is broken down,
      Dance over, my Ladye Lea;
    London Bridge is broken down
      With a gay Ladye!

  2. How shall we build it up again
      Dance over, my Ladye Lea;
    How shall we build it up again?
      With a gay Ladye!

  3. Silver and gold will be stole away, etc.

  4. Build it up with iron and steel, etc.

  5. Iron and steel will bend and bow, etc.

  6. Build it up with wood and clay, etc.

  7. Wood and clay will wash away, etc.

  8. Build it up with stone so strong!
      Dance over, my Ladye Lea;
    Huzza, ’twill last for ages long,
      With a gay Ladye!

                     [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]




                        I HAD A LITTLE NUT TREE


  I had a little Nut Tree,
    Nothing would it bear
  But a Silver Nutmeg
    And a Golden Pear.

  The King of Spain’s daughter
    Came to visit me,
  And all for the sake of
    My little Nut Tree.

                     [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]

  Polly, put the kettle on.
  Polly, put the kettle on.
  Polly, put the kettle on.
    We’ll all have tea.

  Sukey, take it off again.
  Sukey, take it off again.
  Sukey, take it off again.
    They’ve all gone away.

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
