_Drippings From the Fawcett_


My friend Norton took me around Minneapolis recently on an evening’s
jaunt to see the “sights.” After visiting two or three moonlit stores,
Norton suggested that I be introduced to his sweetheart. Brother Norton,
being fairly well varnished with fusel oil and white mule, called at the
wrong house. A colored maid answered the door bell.

“Is (hic) Daisy at home?” he inquired.

“No, suh,” replied the maid.

“Then is Pansy here?” said Norton.

“No, suh.”

“Does Violet live here?”

“No, suh.”

“Then is (hic) Rose in?”

“No, suh, and look here, Mistuh, dis place ain’t no hot house.”

After which I led Brother Norton back to the flivver and we sojourned to
Dutch’s stag cafe for the remainder of the evening.

       *       *       *       *       *

I’ve found another use for my flivver: Deacon Miller’s suckling colt
followed old Lizzie for half a mile the other day.

While at my Breezy Point cabin resort at Pequot I heard an interesting
story regarding the manner in which young Indian men woo their
sweethearts.

When the Indian feels a tug at his heart he will station himself with
a tom-tom in front of the tepee of his beloved and beat frantically on
the drum affair. If the girl loves him she comes out and the medicine
man does the rest. If she scorns his love she places a snow-shoe at the
wigwam entrance and the young chief goes back to his own tepee and keeps
on beating his tom-tom until some squaw girl takes pity and marries him.

Maggie, our new harvest cookhouse chef, lost her brooch the other night,

We’ve had a good laugh on our neighbor, Deacon Callahan, since the
episode several of us witnessed in front of the Palace Shoe Store in
Robbinsdale the other evening. The Deacon saw his wife coming down the
street, so he hid in the doorway of the Palace. When she passed him, he
jumped out suddenly and kissed her. Instead of the scream he expected,
she hoarsely whispered: “Don’t be so bold, mister. Folks ’round here know
me.”

Johnnie Beaton, of Ranier, Minn., tells about a period in his life when
old John Law grabbed out and placed him in the Ranier calaboose. He had
been inside but a short time when one of the local civic improvement
“birds” handed him the usual circular asking a donation for the
improvement of the local jail. Johnnie replied: “The present jail is good
enough to suit me.” Half an hour later, he organized a stud poker game.
As usual, the sucker squawked. His reply to the saphead was pert and to
the point: “Sh! keep still. Do you want to get thrown out of here?”

The “no booze” edict for soldiers during the recent friction with Germany
raised havoc with some of us rum-soaked sinners, but it also had its
comical side at times. I remember a system I put into effect in Camp Lee.
The first sergeant was informed that no passes would be granted to visit
Pennsylvania points (Pennsy was wet) unless the fortunate man returned
with proper credentials, said credentials to be deposited upon arrival in
the top drawer of the skipper’s desk in the orderly room. It was my duty
to check properly the pass“port.”

In our organization was a lieutenant whom we will call Evans for short.
Once upon a time Evans was in a mess (he often was, as far as that goes,
but this time I mean a mess where we eat), and in that mess there also
was a colonel—a man of meanness and incidentally a strict teetotaller.
This colonel saw, or thought he saw, in Evans a gentleman after his own
heart—a steady, yea, even puritanical, officer.

One early morning, Evans returned from a pass to Altoona, Pa., and
flopped his weary way to the mess hall. Collapsing in a seat, he played
with his fork and tried to look sober for a few minutes, and then giving
it up he concentrated on grub—or rather on waiters.

Near the mantelpiece in the mess stood what appeared to Evans to be the
waiter on duty, and he addressed this person—the only other person in the
mess—rather gruffly, I’m afraid.

“Heah—hic—orderly!” he exploded. “D’yuh think I’m—hic—sitting
here—hic—merely to provide you—hic—with a spectacle? I want some food....”

“I’m afraid, lieutenant,” came the acid reply, “that you are providing me
with a spectacle.”

“Good Gawsch!” spluttered Evans. “I thought you were an orderly. I beg
pardon, major; I didn’t shee you were the—hic—colonel.”

Speaking of abbreviated dress brings to mind a recent occurrence in the
St. Paul ball park, whence I had flivvered to watch Minneapolis lose to
the Saints. Coming out, after the game, I bumped into a small boy who had
become lost in the crowd. Upon inquiring why he was crying, he howled:
“I lost my mama.” “Why didn’t you hold to her skirts?” I asked. “I tried
to,” wept the kid, “but I couldn’t reach them.”

    the screen! Natalie Talmadge may find a snag in Buster Keaton’s
    backyard? Join our monthly movie gossip club! These dainty
    morsels are gathered by the Hollywood correspondent of this
    great family journal._

By RICHMOND.


Of all girls in the movies, Edna Purviance has the softest snap. In the
last year and a half, almost two years, Charlie Chaplin has only made one
picture, “The Kid,” which barely occupied more than a few weeks of Edna’s
time. It’s true Edna doesn’t earn much compared to the other stars or
leading women of the screen—they say her contract with Charlie gives her
only $100 a week—but she has time—loads of it—and Edna plays the social
game in that spare time and doesn’t appear to worry her pretty head about
her career or future fame. She has an attractive but modest apartment, a
not too expensive car and maid and puts everything on her clothes, which
are of the smartest.

About two years ago Carleton Burke of Los Angeles began to “rush” Edna.
Carleton is considered the catch of the Pacific coast. He is wealthy—his
family is A-1 socially, Carleton is handsome, traveled and well educated
and has made a name as a polo player. He is also a member of all the
exclusive men’s clubs in San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Well, of course, when Carleton first took up Edna there was much
whispering concerning a Venice bungalow, after Charlie “discovered” the
fair manicurist in a small town near Frisco Bay. Could she be received?
If Carleton Burke meant to marry her, of course, she’d be taken up
eventually anyhow, and the Burkes are not the sort of people you can
snub. So Carleton’s sister, Louise, entertained Edna. The Claus Spreckels
at Coronada did the same and a few other of the selects followed the
lead. Edna accepted these favors with a very calm and ladylike demeanor
quite as if she had a perfect right to the best of social life, and
she created a favorable impression. Edna has sense enough not to carry
vulgar studio movie talk into the drawing rooms of people who wouldn’t
understand. She is never forward or bold and, with her undeniable beauty,
is surely an asset to any function.

However, Carleton has continued to take Edna about—to the Midwick and
other exclusive country clubs, but marriage has never “come off.”
Through Burke, Edna became acquainted with Mrs. Sallie Polk Merritt of
Pasadena—an attractive brunette of social standing but whose name has
been mentioned in a few sensational divorce mix-ups. Sallie and Edna are
bosom friends and go everywhere together.

It is now whispered about Los Angeles that the Burke family has decided
against the marriage.

Rather hard on Edna if she loves him, isn’t it? We don’t really know
whether she cares particularly or not.

       *       *       *       *       *

Can it be that Larry Semon spanks his leading lady love, Lucille
Carlisle, when she doesn’t do as he likes? There was such a violent
spanking in the environs of the Vitagraph lot recently, that Lucille
retired to a hospital for a rest, and a new leading lady replaced her.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is said the beautiful Katherine Macdonald, picture star, earns a mere
$40,000 per picture now. Despite the fact that Katherine looks eternally
sad in her pictures and shows not a glimmer of cheer or sense of humor,
people like to gaze on the American beauty and her clothes. Anyhow her
backers must make a profit or they wouldn’t come through with the “40
thou.” Now, it is said Katherine saves nearly every cent. She is reported
quite the most saving woman on the screen.

The social set like Katherine because she doesn’t get spiflicated
and run around with promiscuous ordinary movie folk, and because she
holds herself “cold and high.” The studio folk on her own lot say
she is “hard,” and that she won’t let them hire blondes for her
pictures because the sunlight has a way of making light hair stand out
conspicuously, and thus detracts from her own person.

Every week or so a San Francisco man named Morrell comes south, and they
say he visits Katherine. The couple are engaged, it is said, and when
her two-year contract is up, intend to marry and quit business for good.
Friends say they are both saving carefully toward that day.

The arithmetical problem is this: If Morrell earns “X” salary and
Katherine $40,000 per picture or about $240,000 a year, how much salt and
pepper will Morrell’s savings buy two years from now? How many steaks and
cream puffs can Katherine buy?

       *       *       *       *       *

In a recent issue we dealt somewhat with the male sissy whose devastating
inroads have made themselves particularly felt in this Egyptianesque
hotbed of art, near art and the no end of things for which poor art is
blamed—Hollywood.

Our readers will recall that some months ago a very noted “heavy” of the
films, a man nearing the fifties and with a wealth of apparent masculine
comeliness, was arrested in company with another male person after a
perfectly inquisitive detective had watched them through a keyhole of the
film star’s home.

Broken in the prime of life, an object of scorn and with others fearing
to be seen in his company, even for business purposes, his plight is
a sorry one. More seldom as the months pass does his white head and
Romanesque profile appear upon the screen.

There is grim humor in the plight of this man. The name of an immensely
rich woman was mentioned in connection with his arrest. It was intimated
that he had grown cold in his attentions to her and that the detective
who trapped the two men was well paid with feminine gold. She must have
suspected something.

       *       *       *       *       *

Wedding bells and hopeful love of man and woman seems to have broken out
afresh in the picture world. Wasn’t it in an issue four months back that
we confidentially confided to our readers that Charlie Chaplin was openly
adoring a sweet young thing of seventeen? Just about four months after
we cheered you with this item, the daily papers declaimed that all signs
and portents were to the effect that May Collins was to become the second
bride of the comedian.

Needless to say, Miss Collins by this time has been “interviewed.” With
the awe-striking wisdom of seventeen—some say she is younger—the girl
sets forth, or so she is quoted, a panacea for marriage ills. She did not
admit she was going to marry Charlie but she wasted no space in praising
anyone but him. It appears that if May marries Charlie that the path of
true art will not be tampered with and if Charles wishes to remain out on
business, or otherwise further his picture activities, that May will not
offer hindrance.

Mildred Harris, too, was seventeen when she married Charlie and
complained that the boy stayed away too much. Should May and Charlie hook
up we may be able to watch the theories of two seventeen-year-old misses
work out, as regards their ideas of what the lord and master should do.

       *       *       *       *       *

When Buster Keaton goes out in the evening he takes his whole family.
There are so many of them we’ve lost count. Anyhow, when he goes down
to Sunset Inn at Santa Monica the waiters have to move three tables and
put them together so that all Buster’s family can be seated. There are
several sisters and as many younger brothers and a “Pa” and lots of aunts
and uncles. And Buster cheerfully pays the bill.

A little incident has been reported to the correspondent of this great
family journal. It appears Buster had been out with some lady of whom
his father objected, or had done something which his “Pa” didn’t like
and there was an argument over at the Metro studio. “Pa” perhaps hasn’t
forgotten his ancient and pleasant right of parental authority. However,
Buster is resourceful. It is said he put “Pa” in his dressing-room and
locked him up for the night, going on about his own business thereafter.

We wonder, if, when Natalie Talmadge marries Buster this spring, she will
have to lock his family in the closets occasionally in order to prevent
little rows!

The Tale of a Shirt

Comfort, the farmers’ journal, says this: Is there any way for a girl to
tell her sweetheart his shirt-tail is out? The same way she would tell
her brother or cousin or any friend. A sweetheart’s shirt-tail is no more
sacred or worthy of respect than any other shirt-tail. A tail belongs to
a shirt as much as cuffs or a collar and isn’t any more indecent. I’d
tell anyone to tuck his shirt in—just like that.

My girl is so fat she wears inner tubes for garters.

Especially When the North Wind Blows

She was a silly little, gushing thing, and habitually talked without
thinking, and in the exaggerated fashion which the female of the species
at present affects. Lately married, she was able to induce her adoring
hubby to go with her on shopping expeditions. Even when the tour included
a visit to an establishment where the most intimate of feminine garments
were on sale, he did not flinch.

In one such shop, the discreet manageress inquired as to whether a
certain set of silken unmentionables, recently purchased, had given full
satisfaction.

The little bride’s eyes grew round.

“Oh, they were beautiful!” she burst out, in her usual fashion.
“Everybody admired them—everybody!”

Turning pale, the unfortunate bridegroom didn’t know for a moment whether
to file for congress or go out and get a stiff drink of moonshine.

       *       *       *       *       *

She had a sore throat, and was unable to sing, so the manager buzzed
her off to the theater’s medical man the tooter the sweeter. The doc.
produced his laryngoscope, and as he was adjusting it he pleasantly
remarked, “You’d be surprised how far we can see with this little
instrument.”

“Oh, is that so, doctor?” she faltered. “Well, it can’t be helped, but I
ought to tell you that I really had no time to change my things before I
came out.”




_Whiz Bang Etiquette_


Is your etiquation on etiquette inetiquate? Do you pull the faux pas,
gaucherie, vulgarian, and other boners too humorous to mention?

Read these questions thoughtlessly, study the answers carelessly and add
both to your misinformation on this subject:

What do you know about introductions?

If Green and Brown met at your home brewery for the first time, would you
say, “Green, meet Brown. Boys, have a drink,” or vice versa? Suppose the
Siamese Twins dropped in about that time to borrow your recipe for double
brew. Would you present them plurally or en mash?

Don’t introduce them; familiarity breeds a thirst.

The ballroom should always be a center of (physical) culture and grace.

What is the correct position for the gentleman in dancing?

Cheek to cheek.

For the lady?

Vice versa.

Is it correct to wander away from the ballroom with a dancing partner?

If you become delirious, you may wander.

Is the “shimmy” done in the best society?

Yes.

How?

Like a bowl of jello in an earthquake.

Should one try to dance if they do not know the steps?

No, that would brand you as a hopeless vulgarian.

Should one crack jokes about the ladies’ gowns?

No, your conversation should not be confined to trivialities.

If a girl asks you in when you escort her home from the ball at 3 a. m.,
should you accept her invitation?

Politely decline, and give me her address.

Every dinner should begin with a little soup and less noise.

Should the lady of the house help the soup?

Yes, if it needs it.

What would you do if you made a wine stain on a lady’s dress?

Help her to remove it, the stain.

Should you decline wine by clapping your hand on top of your glass?

I wouldn’t.

Should water be taken directly from a finger bowl?

No, a soup ladle is placed at each plate for this purpose.

Etiquette is used in many other ways, but these few simple-minded rules
will get you out of some of the worst places.




_A Dilemna De Luxe_

By MARGARET MANNERS


It was embarrassing, to say the least! The young man strove vainly to
retain his equilibrium, also his hold upon the inert form in his arms.
But the color mounted in a vivid flush of red to his very blonde hair.

Then the nearby group of watchers laughed. He was still more confused.
The auburn locks of the fair figure in his arms became loosened and fell
in a cascade almost to the floor. The man was visibly disconcerted, and
letting go with one hand, he clutched at his collar and gazed wildly down
at the cold, upturned face.

With a renewed effort to escape the taunting eyes of the curious,
snickering crowd, he gathered the slim figure to him once more, when a
shout went up and, looking back, he saw that the gown he had hastily
loosened at the neck of the fair vision when he had first come upon the
scene, had slipped off and lay in a soft silken heap at his feet. He was
painfully aware that all that remained to view was the daintiest of filmy
lingerie, and sheer, silken hosiery. One tiny pump had fallen off.

The young man thought he would faint if he did not escape the crowd
that had rapidly grown to a curious mob. The sight of a very flushed
youth, holding the limp female figure in his awkward arms, scantily
clad, beautiful face impassive, instead of exciting sympathy, brought
forth only mirth at his clumsy attempts to withdraw. Evidently such an
experience had never occurred to the embarrassed youth before, but he
rallied and finally reached the door.

As he started through, carefully, almost tenderly holding the lovely
form, the delicate crepe de chine underslip caught on the little glass
doorknob; to his utter chagrin, he let go altogether, leaning against the
framework of the door; this was too much!

Wildly he thought of abandoning his duty, when the stern voice of a very
dapper, wax-mustached, and excited gentleman who forced his way through
the door, brought him up with a jerk.

“What ees the matter with you?” almost shrieked the head floorwalker of
“The Elite Modes” shop. “Look, look!” he cried, gesticulating wildly,
“worse than ze bull in ze china-closet! Go back to where you belong, and
stay there!”

The new window dresser of “The Elite Modes” gave one look at the broken
nose of the wax window-model which he had dropped, and fled—back to his
old love, the gingham department!

“It is forty years since my husband even kissed me,” complained a woman
in Hennepin county divorce court.

There is much pathos in that “even.”

The Sinai Joke

A bishop who had been widely advertised for a speech at Westminster
Abbey, was greeted by a record-breaking audience. The famous Abbey was
crowded to the doors.

As the bishop stepped to the rostrum and opened the good book he said, “I
will take for my text today, ‘And when the Lord ascended Mt. Sinai, What
did he say?’” And, looking at those assembled in the balcony, he said
again, in a louder voice, “‘And when the Lord ascended Mt. Sinai, What
did he say?’” And once again, looking upward to the gallery, he shouted
(as if waiting for an answer), “‘And when the Lord ascended Mt. Sinai,
What did he say?’”

A little Australian buddy, unable to contain himself any longer, rose
from his place in the rear and, standing on his seat, raised his hand:
“I’ll bite, bishop, wot did ’e say?”

       *       *       *       *       *

Nice Burglar

“Oh, Myrtle! Weren’t you frightened to death when that burglar broke into
your room?”

“Frightened is no name for it; I was dressing.”

“Mercy, how embarrassing! Whatever did you do?”

“Oh, he was very considerate, he covered me with his revolver.”

       *       *       *       *       *

She may be deaf but she’ll get her hearing the morning.

Out of the Past

A rookie, all dolled up in his new uniform and ready for first liberty,
strutted down the steps of the barracks and met the colonel coming up.
The silver eagles of the colonel’s shoulder straps meant nothing in
this rookie’s young life, and he was about to pass with only a casual
glance. The colonel, feeling somewhat different, addressed the lad in an
impressive voice: “Young man, how long have you been here?” The rookie’s
face radiated surprise and gladness at having thus been noticed by an
apparent old timer, and he eagerly replied: “Why, I been here three days,
how long you been here?”

_California Beach Nuts_

BY REV. “GOLIGHTLY” MORRILL

Pastor People’s Church, Minneapolis, Minn.


California’s coast is a big bathing beach. The state is not only famous
for its walnuts, but for its beach nuts one sees every day, especially
Sunday.

The ocean strand is covered with half-dressed women, boys and girls
sprawled out like goats and satyrs hugging the shore and each other. It
is the playground of the sexes.

At many bathing resorts Sunday is anything but religious. The cross
gives way to Cupid’s bow and arrow. The Bible is the book of nature
done in calf. Brown lads lie with their heads in the laps of half-naked
brunettes, forgetting that to do so and not mean harm is “hypocrisy to
the devil” who tempts their virtue. They make no attempt to hide under
beach umbrellas. One may question their propriety, but neither their
nerve nor shape. Their speech is low, but if actions speak louder than
words, their conduct is often vulgar if not vicious. We saw a place
advertised as the “safest beach,” but without falling into the deep
water we fear the devil’s undertow is carrying many out beyond their
moral depth. “Love one another” is the favorite text, and the “laying
on of hands” is not omitted. All the flesh-pots were not in Egypt.
Cleopatra had a good time on the Nile and “Clara” has the same time here.
We saw many couples and decided that more marriages were made on the
beach than in heaven. Position in society is everything. Here there was
everything in position. Heads in laps, arms around waists, boys in girls’
laps, girls in boys’, legs linked, or arms and legs tied up in lover’s
bow-knots. All were taking “Sea”estas in their “surge” suits. The sight
was very “surf”eiting. In this Cupid school we saw girls with pearly
teeth, but with no pearls of wisdom; many who could paint their face,
but not paint a Madonna; girls who could play with the boys, but not the
piano; the only apparent study was that of anatomy.

Breakers on the beaches are divided into three classes: ocean-breakers,
law-breakers and heart-breakers. California is a fruit state and we
looked everywhere to see the “peaches” on the beaches—but most of them
were dried, and there were more old Iowa valetudinarians and bearded
bipeds than anyone else. Timon of Athens was a misanthrope who went to
the seashore to get away from mankind. Had he come to this beach, the day
we were there, he would have prayed for a tidal wave to wipe it off the
map.

Scripture says of the beautiful lilies, “they toil not, neither do they
spin.” Of these painted, half-dressed, lounging, walking, posturing
beach-combers with their dry feet, we say, “They toil not, neither do
they swim.” We came away from the beach that Sunday with a composite
picture of pop-eyed, pot-bellied promenaders in the sand, vulgar Venuses,
wobbly wenches, living links, heavy-hipped hags, sinuous, shrunken men,
tattered tights, tousled head nymphs, and vain cock of the walks admiring
their own shape and gazing on their feet and fingernails.

We wish we could forget the bather’s singularity and angularity, the
plethoric paunch, the blinking, bawling, calling, sprawling, mawling,
drawling, squalling figures that defaced the beauty of the sky, the sea
and the sand. Oh, the water cataracts running and dripping from shaking
sides, heavy hips and swinging busts! If Ulysses and his crew sailed by
this shore with its sweating sirens and howling hurdy-gurdies, they would
stop their ears—but not for fear of being enticed ashore.

The poet sings of the “smile” of the sea—we do not wonder at laughing
waves when they see some of the freak styles. What are the wild waves
saying? Some things we think we better omit. To watch this beach of
bathers is like having a front seat at the Winter Garden Follies. The
visitor may study the contour of beach and bathers. Here he meets
the living skeleton of angles and the bag of bones, as well as her
heavy-set sister with all her capricious curves, crests, elevations and
depressions. How unlike the pictures in the Sunday supplements, and how
like the caricatures in the comic supplement. When first they appear all
nice and dry they are passable, but look at them if you dare and can,
when they take a dip or flop and come out with their homely lines all
emphasized. No Greek statues, no things of beauty and joy forever, but
shattered, disenchanting dreams, or nightmares rather.

Farewell to this flotsam and jetsam, foam and scum, these sand-flies.
If you want to have a “good time,” go to the beach where the volume of
nature and human nature is “wide open.” The text books you should bring
and study on the seashore are Shelley, Burns, Sand, Crabbe and Bacon.

    Dickory, dickory, docking,
    The mouse ran up her stocking,

    Which makes it twice as shocking!

       *       *       *       *       *

A marriage certificate is a mere scrappy paper. One divorce leads to

Another Jellyfish

“Boys,” asked the school master, “what do you consider the most beautiful
thing in the world?”

“Sunshine,” hazarded one boy.

“Flowers,” ventured another.

Both answers were received with favor, and the turn went to a hefty youth.

“A woman,” announced he gruffly.

“Come out here,” commanded the master, sternly.

A good flogging was administered; and then the offender was bidden to go
home and tell his father that he had been flogged, and why.

Next morning the floggee was again hauled up.

“Did you tell your father that you had been flogged?” asked the master.

“Yes, sir.”

“Did you tell him why?”

“Yes, sir.”

“What did he say?”

“Please, sir, dad and I talked it all over between us, and we’ve come to
the conclusion that there’s something funny about you.”

“_The Bull is Mightier Than the Bullet_”


Press dispatches recently carried an item to the effect that although
slightly mentally affected, the mother of Charlie Chaplin, upon her son’s
earnest persuasion, had been allowed to enter this country from England.

Mrs. Chaplin, upon reaching New York, stood a chance, it was stated, of
having to return had it not been for quick and effective energies of her
sons and their friends in political power.

Those who know Chaplin well declare that the intense melancholy for which
he is noted is due more than anything else to the affection and concern
for his mother. Such things as domestic troubles, it is said, bear little
weight with the man who daily makes millions laugh. ’Tis the mother.

What have we here! Consider this monumental fun-maker of the screen.
Death is bad enough but when the mind of one very dear becomes clouded,
then indeed does tragedy and sadness smite with a heavy hand.

We read of the circus clown whose wife and children burned to death, and
yet, to keep a date with the world of fun lovers, he went ahead that
night and clowned as never he had clowned before. Have we in Chaplin a
great tragedy also? It will be recalled that when he was a small boy in
London he and his mother and brother lived in a workhouse in order that
the streets might not be their home.

Now his mother is coming home to him, to live amid all the luxury that
great wealth may bring; wealth that came after a sad little fellow with
merry feet, living in a workhouse with his mother, learned to be the
greatest of all fun-makers. Life’s a funny proposition, folks, isn’t it?

Half a century ago the nude in art was strange enough in America to
uplift Puritanic hands in holy horror. Today, among all cultivated
people, the female nude is most matter-of-fact. Our notions of art the
country over have been steadily clarifying, until at last the great
distinction has been recognized and conceded even by pious folk that,
while the human male figure is impossible, the female form is purely
beautiful.

Those rabid for realism and resolutely uncompromising, will have the
assurance to claim innocuousness for the undraped male; but the opinion
today among those who are not extremists is still definitely against the
frank exposition of the male form in plastic or painting.

At worst the mind receives merely a filip of interest; and complete
nudity, to the male fancy, repeated again and again in art, speedily
sates curiosity, and with that, incipient desire. As for the minds
of women, no one would insult them with the suspicion that they find
anything provocative in the portrayal of figures of their own sex.

In every landscape the eye notices at once and unavoidably the hills; it
finds the plains and valleys only by an effort of the will. This fact has
ever been admitted by the modern stage, which is, so far as the ethics of
objective morality go, more conservative than modern art in its advanced
attitude.

Be a Booster

    If you can’t be a pine on the top of the hill,
      Be a scrub in the valley, but be
    The best little scrub by the side of the hill,
      Be a bush if you can’t be a tree;
    If you can’t be the sun be a star,
    But the best little booster wherever you are.

Teach me that 60 minutes make an hour, 16 ounces one pound and 100 cents
one dollar. Help me so to live that I can lie down at night with a clear
conscience, without a gun under my pillow and unhaunted by the faces of
those to whom I have brought pain. Grant that I may earn my meal-ticket
on the square, and that in earning it I may do unto others as I would
have them do unto me. Deafen me to the jingle of tainted money and to
the rustle of unholy skirts. Blind me to the faults of the other fellow
but reveal to me my own. Guide me so that each night when I look across
the dinner table at my wife who has been a blessing to me, I will have
nothing to conceal. Keep me young enough to laugh with little children,
and sympathetic enough to be considerate of old age. And when comes
the day of darkened shades and the smell of flowers, the tread of soft
footsteps and the crunching of wheels in the yard—make the ceremony short
and the epitaph simply ‘=Here Lies a Man.=’

London Stuff

He had been married about a year and had taken to spending his evenings
out West with the boys. One night his conscience worried him, and he
thought he would phone his wife to have dinner with him.

“Hello, kiddo,” he began. “Slip on some old clothes and run down and meet
me on the quiet. We’ll have a good dinner and then smear a little red
paint around. How about it?”

“I’ll be delighted to join you,” was the reply. “But why not come up to
the house, Jack, and get me? There’s nobody home.”

Today the young husband spends every evening at home. His name is Philip.

Then His Nerve Failed

One of the loveliest of girls went into a gents’ furnishing store
to buy a necktie. She hesitated a moment, and then asked in a nice,
straightforward way: “I want to put it on, please. Would you tie it for
me?”

The clerk felt a little nervous, especially as the other fellows were
watching him, but she had already pulled off the necktie that she wore.
He said, “Certainly,” and, putting the new one around her neck as she
ducked her head. She wore a dainty white silk shirt. When the tie was
tied, the ends seemed a bit long, and he suggested: “Do you wear the ends
tucked in?” “Yes,” she returned with unembarrassed absentmindedness. At
this point his courage failed him.

“Both of dese here gents,” said the witness, Mandy Thomas, rather

“Relate the conversation,” said the prosecutor.

“Ah don’t jest remember, sah,” said Mandy, “’cept dat dey was callin’

_Smokehouse Poetry_


_Whiz Bang has a double-winner for Smokehouse fans next issue! “The Lure

    _“O’er chicle camps and logwood swamps_

The Hoboes’ Convention

By George Liebst

    You have heard of big conventions,
      And there’s some you can’t forget,
    But get this straight, there’s none so great
      As when the hoboes met.

    To Portland, Oregon, last year
      They came from near and far;
    On “tops” and “blind” where cinders whined,
      They rode on every car.

    Three hundred came from New York state,
      Some came from Eagle Pass;
    That afternoon, the third of June,
      They gathered there en masse.

    From Lone Star state came “Texas Slim”
      And “Jack the Katydid”;
    With “Lonesome Lou” from Kal’mazoo
      Came “San Diego Kid.”

    And “Denver Dan” and “Boston Red”
      Blew in with “Hell-fire Jack,”
    “Andy Lang” from lakeshore gang,
      “Big Mac” from Mackinack.

    I saw some boys I’d never met;
      A bo called “New York Spike,”
    “Con, the Sneak,” from Battle Creek,
      And “Mississippi Ike.”

    Old “New York Bill,” dressed like a duke,
      Shook hands with “Frisco Fred”;
    And “Half-breed Joe” from Mexico
      Shot craps with “Eastport Ed.”

    “St. Louis Jim” and “Pittsburg Paul”
      Fixed up a jungle stew,
    While “Slipp’ry Slim” and “Bashful Tim”
      Croaked gumps for our menu.

    The “Jockey Kid” spilled out a song
      Along with “Desp’rate Sam”;
    And “Paul the Shark” from Terrors’ Park
      Clog-danced with “Alabam.”

    We gathered ’round the jungle fire,
      The night was passing fast;
    We’d all done time for every crime,
      And talk was of the past.

    All night we flopped around the fire
      Until the morning sun;
    Then from the town the cops came down—
      We beat it on the run.

    We scattered to the railroad yards,
      And left the “bulls” behind;
    Some hit the freights for other states,
      And many rode the “blind.”

    Well, here I am in Denver town,
      A hungry, tired-out bo;
    The flier’s due, when she pulls through,
      I’ll grab her and I’ll blow.

    That’s her—she’s whistling for the block—
      I’ll make her on the fly;
    It’s number nine—Santa Fe line,
      I’m off again—Good Bye!

       *       *       *       *       *

Mushy Stuff, Eh?

    He blushed a fiery red,
    Her heart went pittypat;
    She gently hung her head,
    And looked down, at the mat.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mary Jane

_Ah, here we have the second spasm of the rollicking thirst emporium
ditty_:

    Oh, she promised to meet me
    When the clock struck seventeen,
    At the stockyards, just three miles out of town,
    Where the pig eyes and pig ears and the
    Tough old Texas steers
    Sell for sirloin steak at
    Eighteen cents a pound.

CHORUS:

    Oh, she’s my honey, my baby,
    She’s maul-eyed, she’s crazy,
    She’s knock-kneed, she’s pigeon-toed, she’s lame.
    Although her lower teeth are phoney
    From eating Swift’s bologna,
    She’s my freckled face, consumptive Mary Jane.

Casey’s Revenge

_Did you ever hear that noted recitation, “Casey at the Bat?” Here’s a
baseball soul with a more generous poetic disposition. He replies to the
old classic, which, as you remember, ended with the mighty Casey striking
out, and Glory-be, it sure gives us a thrill, and reminds us of our own
Mudville nine. Heave ho to this “Curve”_—

—By James Wilson.

  There were saddened hearts in Mudville for a week or even more;
      There were muttered oaths and curses—every fan in town was sore.
  “Just think,” said one, “how soft it looked with Casey at the bat,
      And then to think he’d go and pull a bush league trick like that.”
  All his past fame was forgotten; he was now a hopeless “shine,”
      They called him “Strike-out Casey” from the mayor on down the line.
  And as he came to bat each day his bosom heaved a sigh,
      While a look of hopeless fury shone in mighty Casey’s eye.

  The lane is long, some one has said, that never has a turn again,
      And Fate, though fickle, often gives another chance to men.
  And Casey smiled—his rugged face no longer wore a frown;
      The pitcher who had started all the trouble came to town.
  All Mudville had assembled; ten thousand fans had come
      To see the twirler who had put big Casey on the bum;
  And when he stepped into the box the multitude went wild,
      He doffed his cap in proud disdain—but Casey only smiled.

  “Play ball,” the umpire’s voice rang out, and then the game began;
      But in that throng of thousands there was not a single fan
  Who thought that Mudville had a chance; and with the setting sun
      Their hopes sank low—the rival team was leading “four to one.”
  The last half of the ninth came round, with no change in the score;
      But when the first man up hit safe the crowd began to roar.
  The din increased, the echo of ten thousand shouts was heard
      When the pitcher hit the second and gave “four balls” to the third.

  Three men on bases—no one out—three runs to tie the game,
      A triple meant the highest niche in Mudville’s hall of fame;
  But here the rally ended and the gloom was deep as night
      When the fourth one “fouled to catcher” and the fifth “flew out at
        right,”
  A dismal groan in chorus came—a scowl was on each face—
      When Casey walked up, bat in hand, and slowly took his place;
  His bloodshot eyes in fury gleamed; his teeth were clinched in hate
      He gave his cap a vicious hook and pounded on the plate.

  But fame is fleeting as the wind, and glory fades away;
      There were no wild and woolly cheers, no glad acclaim this day.
  They hissed and groaned and hooted as they clamored “strike him out.”
      But Casey gave no outward sign that he had heard this shout.
  The pitcher smiled and cut one loose; across the plate it sped;
      Another hiss, another groan—“strike one” the umpire said.
  Zip—like a shot, the second curve broke just below his knee—
      “Strike two” the umpire roared aloud; but Casey made no plea.

  No roasting for the umpire now—his was an easy lot.
      But here the pitcher whirled again—was that a rifle shot?
  A whack, a crack, and out through space the leather pellet flew—
      A blot against the distant sky, a speck against the blue.
  About the fence in center field in rapid whirling flight,
      The ball sailed on; the blot grew dim and then was lost to sight.
  Ten thousand hats were thrown in air, then thousand threw a fit;
      But no one ever found the ball that mighty Casey hit.

  Oh, somewhere in this favored land dark clouds may hide the sun,
      And somewhere bands no longer play and children have no fun;
  And somewhere over blighted lives there hangs a heavy pall;
      But Mudville hearts are happy now—for Casey hit the ball.

Expurgated

By a Former Acting-assistant Buck Private, Budd L. McKillipps.

    Last night I was at a party
    And some fellow sang a song,
        A song I’d heard,
        But this poor bird
    Had half the words all wrong.

    He sang a soldier ballad,
    But it lacked the army tang;
        It sounded strange
        To hear the change,
    These were the songs he sang:

    _Mademoiselle from Armentieres;_
        _Parley Vouz,_
    _Mademoiselle from Armentieres;_
        _Parley Vouz,_
    _Mademoiselle from Armentieres,_
    _She hasn’t been kissed in forty years,_
    _Hinky Dinky Parley Vouz._

    I’d tell you the way we sang it
    Around the cafes in France,
        (The words grow worse
        With every verse),
    I don’t dare take a chance.

    _Oh, I long to see the captain in the grave yard,_
    _With the quartermaster sergeant by his side,_
    _And the non-commissioned officers in the tool house_
    _While the privates in the mess hall running wild;_
    _The non-commissioned officers are a bunch of dirty sticks,_
    _They take us to the drill field and they teach us dirty tricks._
    _Squads East, Squads West, Right Front Into Line—_
    _The dirty bunch of loafers, they give us double time;_
    _Then it’s home boys, home;_
    _That’s where we ought to be,_
    _Home, boys, home, to the land of liberty;_
    _We’ll hoist Old Glory to the top of the pole_
    _And we’ll all re-enlist—when the weather gets cold._

    That wasn’t the way we sang it,
    To comrades garbed in O.D.;
        There’s some may tell
        The real song, well—
    You’ll not find out from me.

    _I want to go home, I want to go home,_
    _The mademoiselles in Gay Paree;_
    _They certainly all feel sorry for me;_
    _I want to go home_
    _I’m here with a busted knee._
    _Oh, hell, I wish I was well,_
    _I want to go home._

    I cried when I heard him sing that,
    ’Twas a song we sang in Brest;
        When long days crept
        And boys were kept
    In stockades under arrest.

    Oh, why do they change those ballads,
    Till nothing’s left but the air?
        They’re made for men
        So sing them when
    There’s no darned women there.

Tribute to the Painted Girl

By Grayce Moody.

    There are girly girls and whirly girls,
    And girls who are bashful and shy;
    There are gay brunettes and dizzy blondes,
    And the girl with the wicked eye.
    There’s the haughty girl who sits on the world,
    As the honey from life she sips,
    But give me the girl the world calls bad,
    The girl with the painted lips.

    She’s there with a smile and a friendly word,
    When the world is going wrong,
    She will jolly you and cheer you up
    And tell you life’s a song.
    She will stick by you and play you square,
    No odds if you’re down and out,
    She’s a dandy pal and a true blue friend,
    I’ll say she’s a regular scout.

    Her life is not all sunshine and roses
    This painted little maid,
    But she hides her hurts behind a smile
    And faces the world unafraid;
    Little she minds what the world says
    Or the “goody girls’” caustic quips,
    She’s worth a thousand “prudish prunes”
    My girl with the painted lips.

Monkey Shines

Two young men were riding on a street car which I chanced to squeeze onto
with some 249 other adults.

“I took my first drink last night, Algernon,” said one of the pair.

“Did you, Clarence? Honestly, where did you get it?” queried the other.

“Down at a near beer parlor. It was real near beer, too, with one-half of
one per cent alcohol and everything.”

“I’ve been drinking, too,” said the other; “I had two whole glasses of
near beer the other night. I was going to a party, you know, and wanted
to get plenty of pep.”

“Did you drink your near beer straight, or did you dilute it with water?”
asked Clarence.

“I drank it straight. I wanted to get the full kick. Straight, you know,
with a coupla chasers.”

“I certainly went crazy after I took that drink, though. I thought I was
going to try to sing at first,” said Clarence.

“I hope none of my friends saw the way I acted after I took that near
beer the other night,” Algernon put in. “I went batty right away. I
started telling all sorts of funny jokes and laughing ridiculously. Went
to see my girl immediately after, and she said she could tell I had been
drinking after I told her. She promised not to tell it, though.”

The two young men got off the car about this time, and a grizzled old
dog sitting in front of me bit the neck off a bottle of turpentine
he carried and drank the contents of the bottle. “I heard that pair
talking,” he said.

Liberty’s Love Lights

light, de mo’ liberty.”

_The Raptures of Cupid_


    _In the April issue we published a model love letter, and
    since then we have been deluged with dimes from anxious swains
    asking us to hurry along another letter, as their sweethearts
    had answered the first and were expecting another. As we are
    always ready to sympathize with crooning youths, and wish to be
    obliging, we are offering another captivating love note in the
    following_:

My dear Miss Gumptious: Every time I think of you, my heart flops up and
down like a churn dasher. Sensations of unutterable joy caper over it
like young goats on a stable roof, and thrill through it like Spanish
needles through a pair of two linen trousers. As a gosling swimmeth with
delight in a mud puddle, so swim I in a sea of glory. Visions of ecstatic
rapture, thicker than the hairs of a blacking brush, and brighter than
the hues of a humming bird’s pinions, visit me in my slumbers; and,
borne on their invisible wings, your image stands before me, and I reach
out to grasp it, like a pointer snapping at a blue-bottle fly. When I
first beheld your angelic perfections I was bewildered, and my brain
whirled ’round like a bumble bee under a glass tumbler. My eyes stood
open like cellar doors in a country town, and I lifted up my ears to
catch the silvery accents of your voice. My tongue refused to wag and in
silent adoration I drank in the sweet infection of love as a thirsty man
swalloweth a tumbler of hot whiskey punch.

Since the light of your face fell upon my life, I sometimes feel as
if I could lift myself up by my boot straps to the top of the church
steeple, and pull the bell rope for singing school. Day and night you
are in my thoughts. When Aurora, rising from her saffron-colored couch,
blushing like a bride; when the jay bird pipes his tuneful lay in the
apple tree by the spring house; when the chanticleer’s shrill clarion
heralds the coming morn; when the awakening pig ariseth from his bed
and grunteth, and goeth forth for his morning refreshments; when the
drowsy beetle wheels to droning flight at sultry noontide; and when the
lowing herds come home at milking time, I think of thee; and, like a
piece of gum elastic, my heart seems stretched clear across my bosom.
Your hair is like the mane of a sorrel horse, powdered with gold, and
the brass pins skewered through your water-fall fill me with unbounded
awe. Your forehead is smoother than the elbow of an old coat; your eyes
are glorious to behold. In their liquid depths I see legions of little
Cupids bathing, like a cohort of ants in an old Army cracker. When their
fire hit me upon my manly breast, it penetrated my whole anatomy, as a
load of bird shot through a rotten apple. Your nose is a chunk of Parian
marble, and your mouth is puckered with sweetness. Nectar lingers on your
lips, like honey on a bear’s paw; and myriads of unfledged kisses are
there, ready to fly out and light somewhere, like bluebirds out of their
parents’ nest. Your laugh rings in my ears like the windharp’s strain, or
the bleat of a stray lamb on a bleak hillside. The dimples in your cheeks
are like bowers in beds of roses—hollows in cakes of home-made sugar.

I am dying to fly to thy presence, and pour out the burning eloquence of
my love, as thrifty housewives pour out hot coffee. Away from you I am as
melancholy as a rat.

Sometimes, I can hear the June bugs of despondency buzzing in my ears,
and feel the cold lizards of despair crawling down my back. Uncouth
fears, like a thousand minnows, nibble at my spirits; and my soul is
pierced with doubts, as an old cheese is bored with skippers.

My love for you is stronger than the smell of patent butter, or the kick
of a young cow, and more unselfish than a kitten’s first catterwaul. As a
song bird hankers for the light of day, the cautious mouse for the fresh
bacon in the trap, as a mean pup hankers after new milk, so I long for
thee.

You are fairer than a speckled pullet, sweeter than a Yankee doughnut
fried in sorghum molasses, brighter than the top knot plumage of muscovy
ducks. You are candy, kisses, raisins, pound-cake and sweetened toddy
altogether.

If these few remarks will enable you to see the inside of my soul, and me
to win your affection, I shall be as happy as a woodpecker on a cherry
tree, or a stage horse in a green pasture. If you cannot reciprocate my
thrilling passion, I will pine away like a poisoned bed bug, and fall
away from a flourishing vine of life an untimely branch; and, in the
coming years, when the shadows grow from the hills, and the philosophical
frog sings his cheerful evening hymn, you, happy in another’s love can
come and cast a tear and catch a cold upon the last resting place of

                          Yours affectionately,

                                                               ANNY JOHN.

A Human Obsession

We’ve got a discharged soldier in our town who was gassed, and had his
leg shot off. He is forever looking for his lost leg, and often seems to
think a woman may have it, with the result that he is arrested every few
days on some woman’s complaint and is let go. We’d call that a pleasant
mania.

A Montevidious Comparison

(From the Montevideo, Minn., American)

In Albert Lea, the other day, a man was shot dead when found with another

A Ladies’ Man

    Tho I’m growing old and feeble,
      And my hair is turning grey;
    And my youth has died within me,
      And my teeth have passed away—

    Tho my strength is fastly failing,
      And a hump is on my back;
    And my bones are getting stiffer,
      And my heart is out of whack—

    Every time I go out walking,
      Some fair dame is bound to fall,
    Nothing in the world can stop them—
      I’m a Ladies’ Man—That’s all.

Abie, to stand on a chair.

The Finest Collection of Figure Studies Ever Published

[Illustration]

KENYON COX in SCRIBNER’S MAGAZINE, says:

With the Greeks and Florentines it was a delight in the beauty of form,
in which the human figure exceeds all other beautiful things. The
Venetians added a delight in the exquisite color and texture of the
flesh. They first perceived that not only was the human body the noblest
in form and line of all existing objects, but in color and softness and
exquisiteness of Light and Shade, the flesh of a woman was more lovely
than pearls or flowers, so a new art of “NUDE” came into existence. The
figure no longer stood for the expression of abstract idea, but was
painted for its own BEAUTY as men paint FLOWERS or LANDSCAPES.

Photographic reproduction in black and white of the famous paintings of
the world. These pictures in the originals hang in the renowned galleries

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
