                          Vallisneria Madness

                         By RALPH MILNE FARLEY

              _A strange and curious little story, about
                   the moonlight mating of flowers_

           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from
                         Weird Tales May 1937.

Seated comfortably on the broad terrace of Professor Gordon’s palatial
mansion, Tom Spencer stared abstractedly at the red disk of the setting
sun, reflected in the turgid waters of the pool in the garden beyond the
edge of the terrace as he listened to his host recount the fascinating
story of the love-life of the vallisneria.

The cameo-face of the white-haired botany professor bore a whimsical
expression as he declaimed, “Beneath the black surface of that muddy
pool out there, the flowers of a score or so of this rare plant which I
brought from tropical Asia, pass their entire humdrum life, except for
one brief night of moonlit love—not unlike our human existence.”

Tom Spencer shifted his keen gray eyes to stare at the matted,
ribbon-like leaves, floating on top of the water, which gave little
indication of floral life below.

The old professor continued, “As you know from my lectures at Columbia,
the vallisneria is a diœcious plant. On one night of each year, the
night of the vernal full moon, the stem of each female flower begins to
stretch, until its ghostly green and white bloom rises to the surface.
Each male flower too feels that same impelling urge, ‘an instinct within
it that reaches and towers,’ as James Russell Lowell says. Listen to how
Maeterlinck, that great poet and scientist, describes their fatal
wooing.”

He opened a book which lay on his lap, tilted it so that its pages were
illumined by the fading sunlight, and read aloud:

    “The green-coated male flowers rise in turn, full of hope,
    toward the flowers which already sway above them in the
    moonlight, awaiting them and summoning them to the magic world
    which lies beyond their native obscurity. But, when half their
    upward journey is done, they reach the limit that their too
    short stems can stretch, and are checked abruptly, before they
    can win their way to their indifferent sweethearts, who
    pridefully refuse to bend to caress them.

    “Filled with yearning, the little heart of each male flower
    swells and swells until it breaks. In a magnificent effort to
    achieve his bliss, he tears himself from his stem, and in one
    incomparable flight rises to perish in love on the surface of
    the pool. Dying, but free and radiant, he floats for one brief
    ecstatic moment beside his beloved, then shrivels and floats
    away; while his mate closes the petals in which she has
    imprisoned his last breath of life, and shrinks back into the
    depths, there to ripen the fruit of that fatal union.”

The sun set, as Professor Gordon closed his copy of Maeterlinck. A
twilight mist began to form above the surface of the garden pool. “How
much more noble are the flowers than we,” he mused. “As Shakespeare
says, ‘Men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but
not for love.’”

His athletic young guest narrowed his gray eyes and stared inwardly at
the vision conjured up by the older man’s reading. “I wonder,” he
breathed.

Professor Gordon broke the spell by saying in a matter-of-fact tone,
“Well, my boy, you are to see tonight the mating of vallisneria, a sight
which my colleagues would give their eye-teeth to witness.”

“I feel flattered——” Spencer began diffidently, shifting his broad
shoulders in an embarrassed manner.

But the fine-featured old man silenced him with a deprecatory, “Don’t,
then! You are more outstanding as a football player than as a student of
botany. I invited you for other reasons than any outstanding ability you
may have shown in your four years of studies under me.”

(Spencer thought, “Most likely to rub in on his colleagues his
non-invitation of them, by asking instead a mere athlete, who is taking
botany merely because it’s a cinch course.”)

Meanwhile the professor was continuing, “I am sorry that I can’t stay
out here with you. The mists affect my throat. And I’m sorry my daughter
Natalie isn’t here either. She helps me take care of the plants, and
you’d find her quite intelligent about them. But she had to go over to
her aunt’s.”

“I shouldn’t think she’d care to miss——”

“Oh, it’s an old story with Natalie. She’s seen the phenomenon before.
And now I must caution you about one thing. Don’t go any nearer the pool
than the edge of the terrace. The flowers, when in bloom, exude a strong
narcotic fragrance, which is rather dangerous. Anyhow, you can see quite
clearly from here.”

He rose, and held out one slender blue-veined hand.

“Good night, sir,” said Spencer, taking the frail hand in his big strong
one. “And thank you for inviting me.”

                 *        *        *        *        *

Tom Spencer eased his athletic frame down into one of the terrace
chairs, and gazed abstractedly at the purpling pink of the western sky.

“Just as well that that brat of his isn’t here tonight,” he mused. “What
on earth could I do to amuse her?” He remembered having seen Natalie
Gordon several times during his Freshman year, hanging around the door
of the Botany Building at Morningside Heights, waiting for her father. A
gawky, pug-nosed, freckle-faced, little thing, with two tightly braided
pigtails—about fourteen or fifteen years old, so he judged. Just as
well the brat wasn’t here.

Spencer turned his attention back to the garden pool. But pitch-darkness
had now fallen, and he could see nothing except the outline of the
shrubs against the deep purple of the western sky. Then trees in the
distance became dimly lit by the full moon, which was rising behind the
house; but the long shadow of the house still obscured the garden and
its pool. A vagrant zephyr wafted a damp, muddy scent of mist up from
the hidden pool.

“I wonder if those water-plants have any consciousness, any volition,
about their tragic mating,” mused Spencer, “or is it all merely
automatic, mechanistic?”

He leaned back in his chair, closed his eyes, and visualized the passage
from Maeterlinck, which the old botany professor had read to him.

                 *        *        *        *        *

He opened his eyes again with a start, and sat erect. The shadow of the
house had receded to the edge of the terrace, and the entire garden,
with the pool in its midst, was now bathed in the chalky light of the
moon almost overhead.

Above the surface of the water hung a cottony swirling mist, which
seemed to portend some sort of boiling activity in the depths of the
muddy pool. The mist thickened and spilled out onto the surrounding
garden.

“Humph!” sniffed Spencer, getting up out of his chair. “Can’t see a
thing from here.” And, forgetful of Professor Gordon’s express
injunction, he ambled down off the terrace, and along the garden walk to
the edge of the pool.

Through gaps in the swirling mist, he could see the matted ribbon-like
vegetation floating inertly in the water. Not a sign of a flower. So he
swung back to the terrace, and slumped down again in his chair.

The mist continued to thicken.

“I guess there’ll be no show tonight,” Spencer grumbled disgustedly.
Then suddenly he sat erect, thrust his broad shoulders forward, and
peered intently through the gathering fog, where dark shapes—human-like
shapes—seemed to be moving.

Brushing the mist away, shedding it, rising above it, and yet still
seeming to be a part of it, they stood out at last, clear in the
moonlight; majestic women, Valkyries, with proudly-held blond heads, and
flashing eyes. Filmy, floating, luna-green robes set off the chalky
whiteness of their perfect features.

A heady perfume wafted across from the hidden pool.

The mist receded until it concealed merely the feet of the beautiful
creatures. Where they stood, whether on the surface of the pool or on
its banks, Spencer could not tell. Swaying slightly, as though rooted,
they undulated their green-swathed arms like seaweed in the tide. Their
heads thrown back with an almost defiant gesture, they bathed their
perfect features in the glaring white light of the zenith moon.

Never had Tom Spencer seen such sheer feminine beauty. He had no
recollection of leaving his seat, but now he found himself standing at
the edge of the terrace, irresistibly drawn by a strange yearning toward
that galaxy of pulchritude. There were some twenty or so of the young
women, their faces all different, each a face of character and
personality, each more beautiful than the last.

Irresolute, Spencer held out his arms toward the entire group.
Which—which one drew him? To which one should he drift? The uncertainty
held him back—that, and the subconscious memory of some warning, some
prohibition—and some third as yet undefined prompting.

And, while he hesitated, there appeared, poking up through the mist at
the feet of the strange regal women, the points of a score of
green-peaked hats. Up they came, and faces appeared beneath them, dark,
cleanly-cut, handsome faces of men; tense, yearning faces, with
flashing, fanatic eyes, each pair of eyes fixed on one of the beautiful
women who towered above.

Gradually they rose, until each man, clad in dark Lincoln green, stood
beside one of the pale, diaphanous women.

And then a strange, inexplicable paradox! The beautiful women were
slender, completely feminine, utterly adorable. The men were well-built,
athletic, thoroughly masculine, seemingly tall rather than short. And
yet the women towered above them.

Tom Spencer’s mind flashed incongruously back to the scrapbooks of his
childhood days, in which he had frequently pasted figures from pictures
taken in different scales, with the result that each figure, properly
proportioned by itself, failed to match the others in size.

Each of the men now clasped his arms around the waist of his beloved,
and stretched and stretched, every sinew of his athletic body taut with
the effort. Although Spencer could not see their feet for the mist which
covered them, he knew that they were standing on tiptoe. An inarticulate
sigh went up from all of them. “Kiss me! Kiss me!” it pleaded. “Kiss me,
though I die!”

But the stately women stiffened, and held themselves more aloof, and
towered even more inaccessibly, with a beauty so flaming that it hurt.
Then their sea-swaying arms floated down until their slim white hands
rested on the shoulders of the men. The pearly faces of the women
inclined slightly—not enough to meet the upward-straining lips of their
mates, but just enough so that they could gaze coldly but enticingly
down. A silvery ripple of sound floated through the moonlight. The women
were speaking, but what they were saying Spencer could not tell.

A strangled flush spread over the faces of the men, as, lifted by the
hands of the women, they rose slowly, until white now with a livid
whiteness, their lips met in one passionate, soul-searing embrace.

Tom Spencer drew in a deep breath, and his fingers clenched, then sprang
open with a sudden gesture of horror, as he realized that those male
heads, so tightly clinging lip to lip with the beautiful mist-women,
were bodiless! The green-clad bodies, which had strained so tautly to
thrust their heads up to that kiss of death, were now slowly slumping,
settling downward, shriveling, turning brown, drifting away in the
swirling mists which bathed the feet of the majestic women.

The heads themselves had lost their realness. The skin had become
wrinkled, leathery, deflated, flabby. The features were scarcely
distinguishable.

Then one by one, with a contemptuous gesture of satiation, the women
flung away the sucked-dry rinds. And Tom Spencer, his gaze intent upon
the expressions on the women’s faces, took no heed what became of the
cast-off rinds.

For a subtle change was taking place in those beautiful but cruel
creatures. A certain matronly smugness coarsened their features, and
they seemed less tall. Yes, they were visibly shrinking, shrinking and
becoming squat and ugly, shrinking back into the mists which masked the
muddy pool. All, all returning to the slime which had spawned them.

All but one! Alone she stood, unmated, still towering slim and beautiful
in the moonlight. And then Tom Spencer knew why he had waited, why he
had not gone to any of the others. For, transcendently beautiful though
they had all been, yet this sole survivor of that glorious company
outshone them all.

Erect she stood, her golden head thrown back, her arms stretched to each
side and raised a little, so that the filmy pale green gauze of her gown
hung from them like the wings of a luna moth.

                 *        *        *        *        *

Spencer gasped and rose from his chair. Forgotten were the warnings of
Professor Gordon, as the young man moved steadily out off the terrace
into the misty moonlight.

Her lips parted, a smile of welcome overspread her cameo face, and then
she spoke—a tinkly, silver, moonlit, rippling voice. “Have you been
waiting long for me?”

“All my life!” breathed Spencer.

She laughed, a friendly, silvery laugh.

Like a sleep-walker, Spencer continued to plod toward her.

Six-feet one he was, a gridiron star, and yet this frail, slim wisp of a
feminine creature towered inaccessibly above him in the mists of the
pool.

Spencer reached her. He clasped his arms around her waist, and stretched
and stretched, every sinew of his athletic body taut with the effort. He
raised his heels from the ground, and strained on tiptoe. A sigh
breathed upward from his lips.

“Kiss me! Kiss me!” he pleaded. “Kiss me, though I die.”

But she stiffened, and held herself more aloof, and towered even more
inaccessibly, while her beauty flamed out so intensely that it gripped
Spencer’s heart with a stabbing pain.

Then her wide-spread arms floated down, until her slim, cool, white
hands rested on Spencer’s shoulders. Her cameo-cut face inclined
slightly, not enough to meet the upward-straining lips of the young man,
but merely enough so that she could gaze coldly but enticingly down into
his eyes.

Like a drowning man, there swept through his mind the vision of heads
wrenched from male shoulders, sucked dry, and cast aside; male bodies
shriveling and drifting away. Well, it was worth it, for that one moment
of transcendent ecstasy. But, at the memory-picture of the
transformation wrought in the beautiful mist-woman by that long,
passionate embrace, he shuddered momentarily. However, he would be gone
then—he would not be there to see it. Once more he strained to reach
his beloved.

But the expected strangling wrench on his neck did not come. Instead the
stiff aloofness of the beautiful girl softened. An expression of
yielding consecration suffused her lovely face. She leaned, she bent
over him, and floated down into his arms.

Their lips met and clung.

                 *        *        *        *        *

A breeze whipped her moon-green gown about him. Opening his eyes, he saw
the mists blown away from the stone bench on which she had been
standing, by the edge of the garden pool.

Now, nestled in his arms, she no longer seemed terrifyingly dominating
and aloof, but instead small and sweet and soft. And she did not coarsen
and sink back into the slime of the pool.

Side by side they sat down together on the stone bench, his arm about
her slender waist, her golden head against his shoulder.

For a long time they sat thus in silence. Then, “Tom,” she breathed.

“You know my name?” he asked in surprise.

“Why not?” she laughed a silvery moonlit laugh.

Again they sat in silence.

At last she pushed softly away from him. “Well, dear,” she said, “it is
very late, and we really ought to be going in.”

“In? Into the pool?”

“No, silly! Into the house.”

He turned, and seized her by the shoulders, and stared fixedly down at
her in the moonlight. Then, with a sigh of gladness, he clasped her to
him.

“You’re Natalie Gordon!” he breathed. “You’re real! And I like you much
better that way.”

“I don’t know what on earth you’re talking about,” said she, “but it’s
all right with me.”

She held up her face, and once more his lips closed on hers, this time
in a wholly human embrace.

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
