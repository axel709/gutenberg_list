            _Classic Variations in Cooking with Texas Eggs_




                                Foreword


This recipe book has been designed to demonstrate the versatility of
cooking with Texas eggs. There are dishes that range from elegant Eggs
Benedict to simple scrambled eggs. The many ways to add protein to the
diet through the use of Texas eggs are included here in suggestions for
main dishes, snacks, and desserts.

Basic instructions on the most common preparation of Texas eggs serve as
the introduction to the book. There are also sections on French dishes,
Tex-Mex favorites, American and international entrees, and desserts.

The Texas Department of Agriculture is most grateful to the American Egg
Board, which granted us permission to reprint their recipes and the
interesting comments on dishes which compose most of the book. Many of
the color photographs also were provided by the American Egg Board.

                        A Note About Texas Eggs


An egg is an egg is an egg?

Maybe so, say some cooks. After all, the national egg industry functions
under the same sanitation regulations, the same standards on grading for
quality and size. But most Texans believe that there is something better
about foods produced close to home.

As long as you’re taking the time to prepare foods that are appealing,
attractive, and nutritious, serve the best—fresh, wholesome eggs from
Texas.

                        LOOK FOR THE TAP SYMBOL,
                             OR THE WORDS,
                          “PRODUCED IN TEXAS.”




                 Following A Recipe That Calls For Eggs


1. Slightly beaten: Use a fork or whisk to beat eggs just until the
yolks and whites are blended.

2. Well beaten: Use a mixer or blender to beat eggs until they are
light, frothy and evenly colored.

3. Thick and lemon-colored: Beat yolks in a mixer for about 5 minutes or
in a blender for about 2 minutes until they become a pastel yellow and
form ribbons when the beater is lifted or they are dropped from a spoon.

4. Stiff but not dry: Beat whites with a mixer or whisk until they no
longer slip when the bowl is tilted.

5. Gently folded: When combining beaten egg whites with other heavier
mixtures, handle carefully so that the air beaten into the whites is not
lost. It’s best to pour the heavier mixture onto the beaten egg whites.
Then gradually combine the ingredients with a rubber spatula, turning
the bowl slowly. Don’t stir.

6. Separating whites and yolks: There are various kitchen gadgets on the
market which will separate eggs, but the most common method is to crack
the egg in the center and shift the yolk from one half of the egg shell
to the other, allowing the white to slip into a bowl and being careful
not to break the yolk. Eggs are easiest to separate when cold, but
whites reach their fullest volume if allowed to stand at room
temperature for about 30 minutes before beating.

7. Cook until coats a metal spoon: For stirred custard mixtures, the
eggs are cooked properly when a thin film adheres to a metal spoon
dipped into the custard.

8. Cook until a knife inserted near center comes out clean: Baked
custard mixtures are done when a metal knife inserted off center comes
out clean. The very center may still not be quite done, but the heat
retained in the mixture will continue to cook it after removal from the
oven.

                      Basic Recipes for Texas Eggs


Master these first, then create your own dishes with sauces, leftover
meats, preserves, or favorite spices.


SCRAMBLED EGGS

                                                              2 servings

_In a book titled “The Old Virginia Gentleman,” its author, George
Bagby, describes scrambled eggs as a “necessary.” For breakfast, for
sandwiches, or as the original skillet supper, families all over the
country agree with Mr. Bagby._

  4 eggs
  ¼ C. milk
  ½ tsp. salt
  Dash pepper
  2 T. butter

Beat together eggs, milk, salt and pepper with a fork, mixing thoroughly
for uniform yellow, or just slightly for white and yellow streaks. Heat
butter in 8-inch fry pan over medium heat until just hot enough to
sizzle a drop of water. Pour in egg mixture. As mixture begins to set,
turn a pancake turner over and gently draw completely across the bottom
of pan, forming large soft curds. Continue until eggs are thickened, but
do not stir constantly. Cook until eggs are thickened throughout but
still moist.[1]

    [Illustration: Egg Tortilla, recipe on page 18.]


FRIED EGGS

                                                               1 serving

_More people greet each day with fried eggs than any other style.
Perhaps you’re a sunnyside up fan, or over-easy or basted is your
preference._

  1 to 2 T. butter
  Eggs
  Salt
  Pepper

In fry pan over medium-high heat, cook butter until just hot enough to
sizzle a drop of water. (If a very large pan is used, more butter will
be needed.)

Break and slip eggs into pan. Reduce heat immediately. Cook slowly to
desired doneness, spooning butter over eggs to baste or turning eggs to
cook both sides. Season with salt and pepper to taste.


POACHED EGGS

_The word poach comes from the French pocher which means to place in a
pocket. Properly poached, the yolk is pocketed smoothly in the white.
Breaking each egg into a saucer before slipping it into the water is
gentler than cracking it directly in, and prevents mishaps._

  Oil
  Water, milk or broth
  Eggs

Lightly oil a saucepan. Add enough water to fill 2 inches deep. Heat to
boiling over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to keep water at a simmer.

Break eggs, one at a time, into dish, then slip each egg into water,
holding dish close to water’s surface. Simmer 3 to 5 minutes depending
on desired doneness. When done, lift eggs with slotted pancake turner or
spoon onto absorbent paper. Drain and trim edges, if desired.

    [Illustration: Eggs Benedict, recipe on page 7.]


BAKED (SHIRRED) EGGS

                                                              4 servings

_Baking is a good way to prepare eggs in quantity—you can multiply the
following recipe to serve a larger group. The addition of cream gives
the eggs a softer finish than that of standard fried or poached eggs._

  8 eggs
  Salt
  Pepper
  ¼ C. half and half or light cream
  4 tsp. butter, divided

Grease four ramekins, shallow baking dishes, or large custard cups.
Break and slip two eggs into each ramekin. Season with salt and pepper
to taste. Spoon 1 tablespoon half and half over each serving. Dot each
with 1 teaspoon butter.

Bake in preheated 350° F. oven until whites are set and yolks are soft
and creamy, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately.


SOFT-COOKED EGGS

_Eggs started in unheated water are less apt to crack than ones put into
boiling water. Follow the directions below, and for a special treat,
serve soft-cooked eggs in egg cups, in the European fashion._

  Eggs
  Water

Put eggs in single layer in saucepan. Add enough tap water to come at
least 1 inch above eggs. Cover and quickly bring just to boiling. Turn
off heat. If necessary, remove pan from burner to prevent further
boiling. Let eggs stand covered in the hot water 1 to 4 minutes,
depending on desired doneness. Immediately run cold water over eggs or
put them in ice water until cool enough to handle.

To serve, break shell through middle with a knife. With a teaspoon,
scoop egg out of each half shell into serving dish. To serve in an egg
cup, put the egg in cup small end down, slice off large end of egg with
knife and eat from shell.


HARD-COOKED EGGS

_No wonder “hard boiled” has come to mean a tough character—boiling
toughens the delicate protein of egg. Gentler cooking pays off in
tenderness. The following method of turning the heat off when the water
approaches the boiling point has two advantages—it won’t toughen the
egg, and it saves energy._

  Eggs
  Water

Put eggs in single layer in saucepan. Add enough tap water to come at
least 1 inch above eggs. Cover and quickly bring just to boiling. Turn
off heat. If necessary, remove pan from burner to prevent further
boiling. Let eggs stand covered in the hot water 15 to 17 minutes for
large eggs. (Adjust time up or down by about 3 minutes for each size
larger or smaller.) Immediately run cold water over eggs or put them in
ice water until completely cooled.

To remove shell, crack it by tapping gently all over. Roll egg between
hands to loosen shell, then peel, starting at large end. Hold egg under
running cold water or dip in bowl of water to help ease off shell.




                         Time-Tested Favorites


EGG SALAD

                                                    4 servings or 2 cups

_This popular combination of hard-cooked eggs, mayonnaise, and
seasonings is often served in sandwiches or in scooped-out tomatoes. It
is great, too, served in a lettuce cup._

  ¼ C. mayonnaise
  2 tsp. lemon juice
  1 tsp. instant minced onion
  ½ tsp. salt
  ¼ tsp. pepper
  6 hard-cooked eggs
  ½ C. finely chopped celery
  4 lettuce leaves

Blend together mayonnaise, lemon juice, onion, salt and pepper. Cut 4
slices from center of 1 egg and reserve for garnish. Chop all remaining
eggs. Stir chopped eggs and celery into mayonnaise mixture until
moistened throughout.

For each serving, spoon about ½ cup into a lettuce leaf. Garnish with
reserved egg slice.

Variations: Add any of the following ingredients to taste:

  Sliced or chopped ripe or green pitted olives
  Chopped green pepper, mushrooms, parsley, chives or watercress
  Shredded carrots
  Shredded Cheddar or Swiss cheese
  Crumbled bacon
  Chopped pimiento strips, onions


DEVILED EGGS

                                                        8 to 10 servings

_These stuffed eggs are so popular at picnics and buffets that the name
“deviled” seems undeserved. It comes from the fiery seasonings sometimes
used; milder variations are below._

  6 hard-cooked eggs
  2 T. mayonnaise
  ½ to 1 tsp. prepared mustard
  ½ tsp. lemon juice
  ¼ tsp. salt
  ¼ tsp. Worcestershire sauce
  ⅛ tsp. pepper

Cut eggs in half lengthwise. Remove yolks and set whites aside. Mash
yolks with fork, then blend in remaining ingredients. Refill whites
using about 1 tablespoon yolk mixture for each egg half.

Variations: Add any of the following ingredients to yolk mixture:

  Chopped parsley or chives
  Deviled ham
  Drained tiny shrimp or flaked tuna
  Minced onion
  Finely minced ham
  Sweet pickle relish
  Parsley flakes
  Finely chopped pitted ripe or green olives, radishes or celery
  Grated Parmesan cheese
  Shredded Cheddar cheese
  Toasted sesame seeds or finely chopped nuts


MEAT BATTER:

                        Enough for 1 broiler or 6 servings of fried meat

_This may be used for batter-fried chicken or one version of
chicken-fried steak. Spices such as garlic salt or paprika may be added
to the flour to change the flavor from time to time._

  2 eggs
  ½ C. milk
  1 C. unsifted flour
  1 tsp. double-acting baking powder
  ½ tsp. salt

In a deep bowl, beat the eggs and milk lightly. Combine the remaining
ingredients and add to the egg mixture, a small quantity at a time. Stir
just until the batter is smooth. Set the batter aside for 30 minutes.
Dip the meat in the batter until it is well-coated and fry in hot oil or
shortening.


PICKLED EGGS

                                                           12 appetizers

_In Pennsylvania Dutch Country, Pickled Eggs are a sign of summertime.
Vary the flavor by substituting pineapple juice or canned beet liquid
for the vinegar. The latter gives them a rosy look._

  2 C. white vinegar
  2 T. sugar
  1 med. onion, sliced and separated into rings
  1 tsp. salt
  1 tsp. whole mixed pickling sauce
  12 hard-cooked eggs

In medium saucepan combine all ingredients except eggs. Simmer over low
heat, uncovered, until onion is tender, about 10 minutes.

Arrange eggs in each of two 1-quart jars with tight-fitting lids. Pour 1
cup vinegar mixture over eggs in each jar. Cover and refrigerate several
hours or overnight to blend flavors. Eggs may be stored in refrigerator
up to 2 weeks.

MAYONNAISE

                                                           About 1¼ cups

  2 egg yolks or 1 whole egg
  2 T. vinegar or lemon juice, divided
  1 tsp. sugar
  1 tsp. dry mustard
  ½ tsp. salt
  Dash cayenne pepper
  1 C. salad oil, divided

In small mixing bowl, beat together egg yolks, 1 tablespoon vinegar,
sugar, mustard, salt and cayenne at medium speed until blended. Continue
beating, adding ¼ cup salad oil drop by drop. Add remaining oil, 1
tablespoon at a time, beating constantly. Slowly beat in remaining
vinegar. Chill thoroughly.

To prepare in blender: Measure ¼ cup oil and all other ingredients into
blender container. Blend at high speed 5 seconds. Blending at high
speed, add remaining oil _very slowly_ until thick and smooth. (If
necessary, turn off blender occasionally and clean sides with rubber
spatula.) Chill thoroughly.


EGGS BENEDICT

                                                              4 servings

_In the dining room of the Waldorf one day in 1894, an inventive but
hungover Lemuel Benedict created a dish that would forever bear his
name. He put together buttered toast, crisp bacon, poached eggs and
Hollandaise sauce—and a classic was born! Oscar of the Waldorf, a menu
maker of the first order, altered the bacon to ham and the toast to
English muffins._

  4 English muffins, split, toasted and buttered
  8 poached eggs
  ¾ C. Hollandaise Sauce
  16 slices Canadian-style bacon, broiled or pan-fried

Top each English muffin half with 2 slices bacon, 1 poached egg, and
about 1 tablespoon hot Hollandaise Sauce. Serve hot.


HOLLANDAISE SAUCE

                                                             About ¾ cup

_While this is a French concoction, the name may come from the fact that
Holland is famous for its butter, a main constituent of the sauce. Louis
Diat, chef extraordinaire and sauce expert formerly with New York City’s
Ritz Carlton, wrote that “if the sauce does curdle, you can bring it
back to homogenous thickness by putting a fresh egg yolk in another pan
and gradually whipping in the curdled mixture.” The blender method
avoids the curdling problem altogether._

  3 egg yolks
  2 T. lemon juice
  ¼ tsp. salt
  ⅛ tsp. paprika
  Dash cayenne pepper
  ½ C. butter (1 stick), chilled and cut in eighths

In saucepan beat together egg yolks, lemon juice and seasonings. Add
half the butter. Cook over low heat, stirring rapidly, until butter
melts. Add remaining butter, stirring constantly, until butter melts and
sauce thickens. Cover and refrigerate if not using immediately.

To prepare in blender: Measure all ingredients except butter into
blender container. Melt butter and add to other ingredients. Blend at
low speed until sauce thickens, 15 to 20 seconds.




                                Desserts


BAKED CUSTARD

                                                              6 servings

_This recipe, the basis for so many others, goes back to the days of
ancient Greece. Unlike modern cooks, however, the Greeks thought it
suitable only for women and children. The pan of water (or water bath)
that the custard cups sit in during baking promotes even cooking._

  4 eggs, slightly beaten
  ½ C. sugar
  ¼ tsp. salt
  3 C. milk, heated until very warm
  1½ tsp. vanilla
  Nutmeg

Beat together eggs, sugar and salt until well blended. Gradually stir in
hot milk. Blend in vanilla. Pour into six (6 oz. each) custard cups or a
1½-quart casserole. Sprinkle with nutmeg. Set custard cups or casserole
in large baking pan, then put pan on rack in oven. Pour very hot water
into pan to within ½ inch of top of custard.

Bake in preheated 350° F. oven until a knife inserted near center comes
out clean; 25 to 30 minutes for custard cups or 35 to 40 minutes for
casserole. Remove immediately from hot water. Serve warm or chilled.

Variation: If desired 1 tablespoon raisins, fruit preserves, drained
fruit cocktail, flaked coconut or chopped nuts may be placed in each
custard cup before adding custard mixture.

RICE PUDDING

                                                              8 servings

_Rice came to this country accidentally in a ship blown off course from
Madagascar to England. The grateful crew thanked the South Carolina
rescuers with a handful of the grains. Just a century later, rice was
called “Carolina gold.” In this golden custard pudding, it lives up to
the name._

  4 eggs
  2 C. milk
  ½ C. sugar
  1 T. butter, melted
  1 tsp. vanilla
  ¼ tsp. salt
  2 C. cooked rice
  ⅓ C. raisins, optional
  Cinnamon or nutmeg, optional

In medium bowl, beat eggs. Blend in milk, sugar, butter, vanilla and
salt. Stir in rice and raisins, if desired. Pour into greased 1½-quart
casserole.

Bake in preheated 325° F. oven 35 minutes. Gently stir rice up from
bottom of dish. Continue baking until knife inserted halfway between
center and outside edge comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes longer.

Sprinkle with cinnamon or nutmeg, if desired.

EASY BAKED CHEESECAKE

                                                       10 to 12 servings

  2 (8 oz.) pkg. cream cheese, softened
  1 C. sugar, divided
  1½ tsp. vanilla, divided
  4 eggs
  1 (9-in.) graham cracker crumb crust, baked
  ¾ C. sour cream

In large mixing bowl beat cream cheese at medium speed until fluffy.
Blend in ¾ cup sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Add eggs one at a time,
beating well after each addition. Pour into crumb crust.

Bake in preheated 325° F. oven 30 minutes.

Blend together sour cream, remaining ¼ cup sugar and ½ teaspoon vanilla.

Gently spread mixture over top of hot cheesecake and bake until center
is set, about 30 minutes longer. Cool completely on wire rack.

Chill until firm, several hours or overnight.


LEMON MERINGUE PIE

                                                         6 to 8 servings

  2 C. sugar, divided
  ⅓ C. cornstarch
  ¼ tsp. salt
  1½ C. cold water
  ½ C. lemon juice
  5 eggs, separated
  2 T. butter
  1 to 3 tsp. grated lemon peel
  1 (9-in.) pie shell, baked
  ¼ tsp. cream of tartar
  ½ tsp. vanilla

In large saucepan combine 1½ cups sugar, cornstarch and salt. Gradually
stir in water and lemon juice until smooth. Beat egg yolks and blend
into sugar mixture. Add butter. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium
heat until mixture thickens and boils. Boil, stirring constantly, 1
minute. Remove from heat and stir in lemon peel. Pour hot filling into
baked pie shell.

Meringue: In large mixing bowl beat egg whites and cream of tartar at
high speed until foamy. Add remaining ½ cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a
time, beating constantly until sugar is dissolved[2] and whites are
glossy and stand in soft peaks. Beat in vanilla.

Spread meringue over filling starting with small amounts at edges and
sealing to crust all around. Cover pie with remaining meringue,
spreading evenly in attractive swirls.

Bake in preheated 350° F. oven until peaks are lightly browned, 12 to 15
minutes. Cool at room temperature.




                        TIPS ON MAKING MERINGUE

When making meringues and some cakes, sugar is slowly added to beaten
egg whites. This serves to increase the stability of the foam. Sugar,
however, can retard the foaming of the whites.

If meringue pies weep, it is probably due to several different problems:
(1) overcooking (2) incomplete blending of meringue (3) oven temperature
too high (4) spreading the meringue on a cold filling (5) overbeating
before adding sugar.


CUSTARD PIE

                                                         6 to 8 servings

  4 eggs
  2½ C. milk
  ½ C. sugar
  1½ tsp. vanilla
  ¼ tsp. salt
  1 (9-in.) pie shell, unbaked
  ⅛ tsp. nutmeg

Beat eggs. Blend in milk, sugar, vanilla and salt. Place pie plate with
prepared shell on oven rack. Pour egg mixture into shell. Sprinkle with
nutmeg.

Bake in preheated 350° F. oven until knife inserted halfway between
center and outside edge comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool on wire
rack. Serve warm or chilled.


CARROT CAKE

                              1 (10-inch) tube cake or 10 to 12 servings

  2½ C. all-purpose flour
  2 tsp. baking powder
  1 tsp. cinnamon
  ½ tsp. salt
  ¼ tsp. ginger
  ¼ tsp. nutmeg
  1 C. butter, softened
  2 C. sugar
  5 eggs, separated
  ½ C. water
  1½ C. shredded carrots
  ½ C. finely chopped pecans
  ½ tsp. vanilla
  ½ tsp. cream of tartar

Stir together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, ginger and nutmeg.
Set aside.

In large mixing bowl beat together butter and sugar at medium speed
until light and fluffy. Add egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after
each addition. Add ¾ cup flour mixture alternately with ¼ cup water,
blending thoroughly after each addition. Repeat with remaining flour and
water. Stir in carrots, pecans and vanilla.

Wash and dry beaters. In large mixing bowl beat egg whites and cream of
tartar at high speed until stiff but not dry, just until whites no
longer slip when bowl is tilted. Gently fold whites into yolk mixture.
Pour into greased and floured 10-inch tube pan.

Bake in preheated 375° F. oven until wooden pick or cake tester inserted
in center comes out clean, about 1½ hours. Cool on wire rack 15 minutes.
Remove from pan and cool completely.


Seven Minute Frosting

                                                                  5 cups

_This frosting is named for the seven minutes of cooking and beating
needed to form the desired glossy peaks. Some cooks use a double boiler
to equalize cooking heat. Cooking should stop the moment the stiff peaks
form._

  2 egg whites
  1½ C. sugar
  ⅓ C. cold water
  ⅛ tsp. cream of tartar
  ⅛ tsp. salt
  1 tsp. vanilla

In large saucepan combine all ingredients except vanilla. Beat 1 minute
at low speed with portable electric mixer. Place pan over low heat and
beat at high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Remove from
heat. Add vanilla. Beat until frosting will hold swirls, about 2 minutes
longer.




                    French Dishes with a Texas Flair


Omelets, crepes, souffles, and quiches are becoming routine fare in many
homes because cooks have found they are actually simple to prepare and
can be combined with a great variety of other foods, especially
leftovers. Texans add hot sauces, jalapenos, fresh Texas vegetables, and
a range of meats to create Lone Star specials.




                                Omelets


FRENCH OR PLAIN OMELET

                                                               1 serving

  2 eggs
  2 T. water
  ¼ tsp. salt
  Dash pepper
  1 T. butter

Mix eggs, water, salt and pepper with fork. Heat butter in 8-inch omelet
pan or fry pan over medium-high heat until just hot enough to sizzle a
drop of water. Pour in egg mixture. Mixture should set at edges at once.
With pancake turner turned over, carefully push cooked portions at edges
toward center so uncooked portions flow to bottom. Tilt pan as necessary
so uncooked eggs can flow. Slide pan rapidly back and forth over heat to
keep mixture in motion and sliding freely. While top is still moist and
creamy-looking, fill, if desired. With pancake turner fold in half or
roll, turning out onto plate with a quick flip of the wrist.

Variations: Omelets can be flavored with a variety of herbs and spices.
Mix in ⅛ to ¼ teaspoon per omelet.

Omelets can hold almost any leftover food. For each omelet, fill with ⅓
to ½ cup of any of the following:

  Shredded or sliced Cheddar, Swiss Mozzarella, Gouda, Provolone, or
              other firm cheese
  Cottage, ricotta or cream cheese
  Cooked, drained and crumbled sausage, bacon or ground beef
  Flaked canned or cooked fish
  Sauteed sliced mushrooms
  Sauteed chopped onions or green pepper
  Drained, cooked, chopped, diced or sliced vegetables
  Drained, canned or chopped or sliced fresh fruit
  Chopped nuts
  Jelly, jam or preserves




                      Nutritional Quality of Eggs

Eggs are especially rich in high-quality protein, unsaturated fats,
iron, phosphorus, trace minerals, vitamins A, E, and K, and all B
vitamins, including vitamin B 12. Eggs are second only to fish liver
oils as a natural source of vitamin D.

Two eggs are an economical means of adding a lot of nutritive value to
the menu. The price per two-egg servings of large eggs ranges from 11 to

PUFFY OMELET

                                           2 servings (Pictured on cover)

_Puffy omelets have a long history, dating back to ancient Roman times.
Beating the yolks and whites separately results in the “puff.” An
ovenproof pan is essential because, after the omelet puffs over a
surface unit, it goes into a hot oven for final baking._

  4 eggs, separated
  ¼ C. water
  ¼ tsp. cream of tartar
  ¼ tsp. salt
  1 T. butter

Beat egg whites with water, salt and cream of tartar at high speed until
stiff but not dry, or just until whites no longer slip when bowl is
tilted. Beat egg yolks at high speed until thick and lemon-colored,
about 5 minutes. Fold yolks into whites.

Heat butter in 10-inch omelet pan or fry pan with ovenproof handle[3]
over medium-high heat until just hot enough to sizzle a drop of water.
Pour in omelet mixture and gently smooth surface. Reduce heat to medium.
Cook slowly until puffy and lightly browned on bottom, about 5 minutes.
Lift omelet at edge to judge color. Bake in preheated 350° F. oven 10 to
12 minutes, or until knife inserted halfway between center and outside
edge comes out clean.

To serve, loosen omelet edges with spatula. With a sharp knife cut upper
surface down center of omelet but DO NOT cut through to bottom of
omelet. Fill, if desired. Tip skillet. With pancake turner, fold in half
and turn out onto plate with a quick flip of the wrist. Serve
immediately.

                          Crepes and Souffles


Basic Crepes:

                         Twelve 7½-inch crepes or Sixteen 6½-inch crepes

  3 eggs
  ½ C. milk
  ½ C. water
  3 T. butter, melted
  ¾ C. all-purpose flour
  ½ tsp. salt

In mixing bowl combine eggs, milk, water and 3 tablespoons melted
butter. Beat with mixer, rotary beater or whisk until well blended. Add
flour and salt. Beat until smooth.

Heat 8 to 10-inch omelet or crepe pan over medium-high heat until just
hot enough to sizzle a drop of water. Brush pan lightly with melted
butter. For each crepe, pour in just enough batter (about 2 tablespoons
for 8-inch pan or scant ¼ cup for 10-inch pan) to cover bottom of pan,
tipping and tilting pan to move batter quickly over bottom. Cook until
lightly browned on bottom and dry on top. Remove from pan or, if
desired, turn and brown other side. Brush pan lightly with melted butter
as needed to prevent sticking. Stack crepes between layers of waxed
paper until ready to fill.

_Eggs have always been treated with reverence in Mexico. It was thought
that, when fed to babies, they would endow understanding. After a
conquest, they were a sign of plenty. In religious observance, pilgrims
offered them as gifts to the Virgin Mary. In everyday meals, the Mexican
preference for spicy seasonings is satisfied in Huevos Rancheros._

                      SELECT TEXAS EGGS BY QUALITY

Texas eggs which are sold in most retail outlets are either Grade AA or
Grade A. Both are ideal for any use, but are especially desirable for
poaching, frying, and cooking in the shell. A Grade AA egg covers a
small area; the white is thick and stands high; the yolk is firm and
high. A Grade A egg covers a moderate area; the white is reasonably
thick and stands fairly high; the yolk is firm and high.

The Texas Department of Agriculture maintains inspection services for
the Texas egg industry to make certain that quality and size statements
on the cartons are accurate. When you buy Texas eggs, you can depend on
getting the most for your money.

_Hard as it is to believe, there was a time when the sandwich did not
exist. It evolved one day when the poker-playing Earl of Sandwich had
his valet bring his meat between bread, rather than break a winning
streak to stop for lunch. Like its creator, this Fried Egg Sandwich is a
winner too._

                           STORING TEXAS EGGS

The quality of Texas eggs will remain high for several weeks if they are
kept in a 45 to 55 degrees F. environment. Even under refrigeration,
they are slowly losing carbon dioxide and water, causing the yolks to
flatten and the whites to spread. Eggs kept outside the refrigerator at
72-80 degrees F. will lose more quality in one day than they will lose
in one week under refrigeration.

plate, salads, and green vegetables. A dash of paprika makes them even
more colorful.

2. Sieved eggs can be applied in ribbons with a cake decorator to molded
salads.

3. Chopped eggs yolks can be sprinkled on cream sauce coverings for
added flavor and color.


SCOTCH EGGS

beer._

  ¾ lb. bulk pork sausage
  12 hard-cooked eggs
  1 egg, beaten
  ⅓ C. fine dry bread crumbs

              Plan Meals with the Basic 4 Foods Every Day


    [Illustration: {Basic food groups}]


                               MEAT GROUP

2 servings per day

Meats, variety meat (heart, liver, kidney), poultry, eggs, fish, dry
beans and peas, peanut butter.

A serving is: 2-3 oz. lean cooked meat; 2 eggs; 1 cup cooked dry beans
or peas; 4 tablespoons peanut butter.

This protein-rich group, good for growth and repair of body tissues;
healthy muscles, skin, organs, blood and hair; also gives us iron,
niacin, riboflavin, and thiamine.


                           BREAD-CEREAL GROUP

4 servings per day

Whole grain, enriched, and restored breads (check labels); also cereals,
flour, macaroni, rice, wheat, rolled oats, and baked goods.

A serving is: 1 slice bread, ½ cup cooked cereal, grits, macaroni, or
rice, 1 oz. enriched ready-to-eat cereal.

These supply food energy, protein, iron, and B vitamins.


                               MILK GROUP

Some for everyone

  Children to 9      2-3 cups
  9-12                 3 cups
  Teenagers            4 cups
  Adults               2 cups
  Women
  pregnant             3 cups
  nursing              4 cups

Cheese can be used as part of the milk to provide calcium for strong
bones and teeth; riboflavin, and vitamin D when milk is fortified.


                         VEGETABLE-FRUIT GROUP

4 servings per day

Citrus fruits, tomatoes, strawberries, cabbage, cantaloupe, for vitamin
C.

Vegetables—yellow or dark green—carrots, sweet potatoes, broccoli,
spinach, etc. for vitamin A.

This group builds healthy gums, body tissues, and skin; better vision,
and good growth.




                           Microwave Cooking


GENERAL TIPS

1. Don’t try to cook an egg in the shell in the microwave. It could
      explode.

2. Eggs continue to cook after they are removed from the microwave. Take
      them out just before they are done.


FRYING EGGS

1. Use a browning skillet.

2. Pierce the yolk in the shape of a cross to break the surface. This
      step will eliminate the possibility of the yolk exploding.

3. Always place a glass of water in the microwave alongside the skillet.
      The water will absorb some of the microwave, allowing the white
      and yolk to cook at the same rate of speed.

4. Bacon cooked along with the egg helps retard overcooking of the yolk.


SCRAMBLING EGGS

1. For a fluffier texture when scrambling eggs, remember to stir the egg
      mixture frequently.

2. Don’t overcook.


POACHING EGGS

1. The eggs must be covered with water to assure even cooking.

2. Piercing the yolk in the shape of a cross to break the surface
      membrane will eliminate the possibility of an explosion.

  The exact time of cooking eggs in a microwave oven will vary according
  to the number of eggs to be prepared at one time and the size and
  temperature of the eggs.




                          EGGS ARE ECONOMICAL

Texas eggs are an economical means of adding a lot of nutritive value to
the menu. The price per two-egg servings of large eggs ranges from 11 to
16 cents; for medium eggs, from 9½ to 14 cents.

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
