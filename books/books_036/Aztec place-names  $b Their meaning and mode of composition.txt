                               PREFACE


Before trying to understand Aztec hieroglyphic writing the student
should gain some ideas as to how Mexican words are constructed and
what changes word elements suffer in being compounded. No words are
more interesting or suggestive in this direction than geographical
names. This is particularly true because the hieroglyphic material
most conveniently accessible to the student chances to be a list of
place-names. The method of study we borrow from de la Rosa’s little
work _Explicacion de algunos de los Nombres de la Lengua Mexicana_.
His mode of analysis and presentation is direct and simple. De la
Rosa’s arrangement has been followed in detail. The name is first
presented in full; the meaning is then given in bracketed print;
the elements are then presented, parts which are dropped in the
compound being italicized; the meaning of each element is given
in parenthesis; suggestions or explanation of special points are
added in some cases. The list of Rules of Composition is taken from
Dr. Antonio Peñafiel. Robelo is generally followed in questions of
meaning.

The student is expected to learn the rules, to learn the meanings of
the place-names, and to study the analyses sufficiently to be able to
explain the construction of any name given in the list. After this
material has been mastered additional exercises in sight-reading and
analysis of new place-names should be undertaken.

        RULES OF COMPOSITION FOLLOWED IN THE MAKING OF AZTEC
                 PLACE-NAMES--(_After A. Peñafiel._)

  1. Geographic names commonly end in some special particle
     indicative of place, as _co_, _e. g._--Anal-co.

  2. When a particle indicative of place is added to a noun, the
     singular form of the noun only is used, even when it carries a
     plural force.

  3. When a particle indicative of place is added to a noun, the noun
     is usually modified--generally dropping its terminal letters or
     syllable, _e. g._--Anahuac from a_tl_, nahuac.

  4. When more than one noun are compounded before the particle
     indicative of place, each commonly drops its final letters or
     syllable, _e. g._--Coacalco from Coa_tl_, cal_li_, co.

  5. For sake of euphony some nouns in composition may remain entire,
     _e. g._--Tzinacanoztoc from tzinacan, ozto_tl_, c.

  6. Not more than three elements or words besides the postposition
     occur in geographic names.

  7. When two nouns only are compounded into a place-name, the first
     loses its final letters or last syllable, while the second
     remains entire. The first is a qualifier of the second and
     follows it in translation, _e. g._--Tecalli from te_tl_, calli =
     “house (calli) of stone (tetl).”

  8. In place-names compounded of an adjective and a noun, the
     adjective precedes, _e. g._--Iztacuauhtli from izta_c_, cuauhtli
     = “the white (iztac) eagle (cuauhtli).”

  9. In place-names compounded of a noun and a verb, the noun
     precedes, _e. g._--Cacalomacan from cacalo_tl_, ma, can = “where
     they hunt (ma) crows (cacalotl).”

 10. In place-names compounded of a numeral and a noun, the numeral
     precedes, _e. g._--Macuilxochic from macuil_li_, xochi_tl_, c.
     Macuilli (five).

Transcriber’s Note:

Words and phrases in italics are surrounded by underscores, _like
this_. Those in bold are surrounded by tildes, ~like this~. Obvious
printing errors, such as inconsistent italics, hyphenation, and
brackets were corrected.

The place-names beginning with “Ch” follow those beginning with “Cu,”
and two words beginning with “Tl” follow entries beginning with “Tu.”
Some definitions within brackets lack the word, “there,” e.g. “Where
are level fields of rushes,” instead of “Where there are level fields
of rushes.”

Not changed:

    Obsolete spelling, e.g. “bambu” for “bamboo.”

    Missing letters between place-name and component parts e.g.
    “Huitzannaola” = “huiz” (missing t ) + “anno” (missing a) + “la.”

    Variations in letters from source word to place-name, e.g.
    “ixtcuin” to “itzcuin” and “Huitzilopuch” to “Huitzilopoch.”

    Reversed letters, e.g. “Tlachquiauhco” = “tlach” + “quiahu” (not
    “quiauh”) + “co.”

        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
