  TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

  This small book printed in 1863 is a reproduction of the original
  ‘Catalogue’ published in 1677. The many printing errors and
  inconsistencies in spelling and punctuation in that Catalogue were
  deliberately carried forward to this 1863 book, which notes in the
  Introduction that it was “here reproduced as almost a fac-simile”.

  This etext has also retained these misspellings and inconsistencies
  and not tried to correct or ‘improve’ the content, and only spacing
  between words is different--two or three or more spaces in the
  original text have been condensed to one space in this etext. A few
  other minor changes are noted at the end of the book.

  Italic text is denoted by _underscores_.

INTRODUCTION.


This little book might easily, by a competent pen, be made the
text to a volume, as large, if not as useful, as the huge “Post
Office Directory,” of which it was the modest precursor. No such
ambitious object as the production of a volume of that class is to
be here indulged in. On the contrary, the purpose of the present
short introduction is to offer a few suggestions upon topics
obviously belonging to the contents of this commercial record of
the merchants and _goldsmiths_ of London in the second half of the
seventeenth century. It will be found to demonstrate the value of
not a few family _names_ as significant elements of the history of
social progress.

It has, indeed, been so in all time. From Homer’s catalogues down
to the knightly nomenclature of the “Roman de la Rose,” and other
long-breathed poems of the middle ages; from the Battle-abbey
Roll of the conqueror’s chiefs at Hastings, and from that of King
Henry’s army at Agincourt to our modern musters, such documents
elucidate acceptably the course of military heroism. The conjecture
is as ingenious, as it is just, lately made about _Shakespeare’s_
early life, that the Admiralty books, with their myriad of seamens’
names, may give his in some royal ship, and so account for his
perfect sea phrases.

The most interesting _manuscript_ lists are those of the
notabilities present at the Preston Guild for more than 500 years;
and that of the founders of a Library in Hereford 200 years ago.
The Guild is in existence still. The books given to the library by
Viscount Scudamore, and some hundreds of the county people, were
rotting on a damp floor not long since. It may be hoped they are
now better cared for.

Equally attractive are the lists still preserved of the zealous
contributors to public loans to meet a national crisis. _John
Locke_ and _Somers_ were among the first proprietors of the Bank of
England. Those of the East India Company, or the like Stocks were
the leading Tories.

The founders of our early colonies--holders of even five-shilling
shares--have thus their enduring record; and a diligent collector
may enrich his library of tracts with the printed names of all the
graduates of old Harvard College in New England in the seventeenth
century--so zealously did the Puritans ground their sons in
learning.

The present production, although of more moderate pretensions,
contains individual names of some historical weight. Its most
striking feature is the severance of “_Goldsmiths that keep Running
cashes_”--precursors of the modern bankers--from the mass of
merchants of London, in 1677.

Before that year the goldsmiths had really been bankers, and
proper laws had long been advocated for their better establishment
in the craft. This list fixes their residence chiefly in our
ancient Lombard Street. Of fifty-eight, the whole number of them,
thirty-eight lived there. Of the rest, we have Blanchard and
_Child_, partners, in Fleet Street, at the Mary-gold; and James
_Hore_ in Cheapside, at the Golden Bottle, for then every house of
business had its sign.

Other banking names are striking, viz. the Cornish Bolitho, the
Lancashire Hornby, the Yorkshire Duncomb. These men may be presumed
to have enriched their descendants who are still conspicuous among
us. The rest of the Goldsmiths of 1677 seem to have been little
remarkable in the next generation, when, after the revolution of
1688, joint-stock banking, and safe facilities in paper currency
took the start which constitutes an era in finance. The capitalists
of London in the reign of Charles II. were sorely damaged by his
iniquitous shutting of the Exchequer against their legitimate
claims. They were content at last to be simply the first holders of
stock in the national debt, into which their claims were turned.
But Michael Godfrey, the first deputy-governor of the bank, and
Sir N. Herne, afterwards zealous supporters of the new system of
banking after 1694, are here only simple merchants. Two other names
of the Goldsmiths, James Fowles and James Heriot, deserve special
mention. They were Scots; and the Fowles appear to have been long
settled in London in connection with their countrymen. In 1695, the
Lord Provost of Edinburgh was to address his letters on the subject
of Darien to William Paterson at the house of one of the name; and
it is no idle speculation to suppose that this goldsmith (a rising
banker) of 1677 afforded Paterson, then a pedlar, or incipient
merchant, the benefit of his financial experience.

James Heriot has a stronger association with a Scottish worthy
of finance, George Heriot, the goldsmith, and the munificent
benefactor of Edinburgh, who came south with his patron, King
James; and, as his biographer tells us, he prospered here as he had
prospered in the north. Besides his bequests to his native town, he
left ample legacies to his brothers-german, of whom one was James;
and their wealth and name were assuredly represented by the James
Heriot the goldsmith of this list.

In it also stands John _Peatterson_, a merchant already, and so
giving a body to the tradition in Dumfriesshire which places
William Paterson of the Bank of England in the counting-house of a
relation of his own name in London about 1677.

The spelling of the two names Fowles and Peatterson is correctly
phonetic, so as to show the Scottish nationality of the men; and in
the latter case showing also the tact with which Eliot Warburton in
his “Darien” makes a Scottish friend criticise his clumsy English
pronunciation of the word Paterson.

Another name in the general list, that of Alexander Pope of Broad
Street, has an even more famous association, as Mr. Camden Hotten
shows in his _Adversaria_ for July, 1857. The locality was then
a charming suburb of gardens; and although the poet Pope, when
taken away with his father, the popish merchant, to be educated in
Windsor Forest by a priest, may have been too young to know how
genial a home he was losing, he need not have been too vain, as it
is feared he was, to revisit in after life the pleasant abode of
his earliest years.

Gresham’s garden was in Broad Street, with its lectures on music
and all science. King Richard’s Crosby Hall, and Shoreditch with
its unhappy leman of Edward IV, were hard by; whilst Milton’s
birth-place, his retreat, and his grave were close at hand.

The picturesque character of old London, graced by the sparkling
Thames of olden time, is a circumstance not to be forgotten, when
we are calling up the memories of any class of its inhabitants.

In 1677 the city was full of fine residences for merchants; and in
this list we meet with names of entertainers of wits of the time.
Here is _Fountain_, doubtless father to the wealthy knight with
whom Dean Swift was familiar, as shown in his letters to Stella.
Here, too, is _Kiffen_, the Baptist Alderman whom James II. could
neither affright nor seduce, with a less respectable name of the
same class, that of William Lob.

Here is _Benjamin Bathurst_, the founder of the family
distinguished on the Bench and in the State, with _Bragg_ their
connexion. Here is a tribe of the _Houblons_, who furnished the
Bank of England with its first Governor, Sir John; and whose names,
seven in number, may be read in documents recorded at the Board
of Trade claiming convoys for their fleets. These seven names
are found in the more interesting record--the sermon of Bishop
Burnet at the funeral of this _Houblon_--with his eulogy and city
descent from Henry the VIIIth’s time. The _Vansittarts_ will find
their wealthy forefather here, and many more Dutch members of the
old church of their nation in Austin Friars. The _Van Milderts_
of this list were doubtless progenitors of the learned late
Bishop of Durham of that name; and the predominance of Dutch over
Flemish merchants settled in London is to be attributed to the
ultra-Protestant feeling of that time. Puckle the wit, and the
eager projector, is here in the persons of his father and uncle.
Nor are the Barnardistons, Ducanes, the Fredericks, Beckfords, and
Papillons, Burdetts, Batemans, Biddulphs, Bulteels, Carbonnels,
Coventrys, the Dominiques, Crisps, Furleys, and the Holfords, to be
omitted.

The “_Richard Steele_” in the list must have been related to Sir
Richard, who was more successful in the advocacy of the rights of
trade with his pen than in his multifarious commercial schemes.

The special occupations of these merchants are not stated with much
precision. After the Goldsmiths come the Black-well Hall factors,
representing our ancient staple in woollens, whose privileges were
the occasion of a great legal controversy shortly before the date
of this little publication; and they were settled with prodigious
learning in the Common Pleas by Chief Justice Sir Orlando Bridgman,
as may be seen in his logical judgments. One particular address is
very interesting. It is at “_the Insurance Office_,” then a new
institution among us, and only extended with great success in the
beginning of the next century, in the reign of Queen Anne.

The Royal Exchange was a prominent place of business for our
merchants of 1677. The Dutch walk, the Turkey walk, the _Irish_
walk, the Spanish walk, and the like, have a significance far
beyond the agreeable cosmopolitan sentiments expressed in the
Spectator upon Addison’s and Sir Richard Steele’s visit to the
Exchange of their day, crowded with men from every clime. In these
several walks could be found, in the earlier years of the reign
of Charles II, the collected members of our various trades beyond
sea; and it was from them that the Lord Mayor was directed by
a royal order in Council, to have elected the body that was to
assist ministers in the preparation of our laws of trade and the
colonies. That original order in council, signed by Lords Clarendon
and Southampton, is preserved in the City library in Guildhall.
It contains an article of extreme interest at this moment,
specially providing for the election of the _Italian_ merchants
to that body. This commercial tie with _United_ Italy cannot fail
to be strengthened so as to revive an alliance with us too long
interrupted by religious prejudice on both sides. The list has a
few Italian names, but more Portuguese--perhaps brought over from
the connection with “_the Royal House of Lisbon_” in the person
of Charles the Second’s Queen, received by us with becoming good
humour, according to the pungent epigram which bade “_the De’il
take Hyde and the Bishop beside, that made her bone of his bone_.”

The division of the merchants in their respective dignities is
worth a passing reflection. Some are knights and baronets; some are
aldermen; the mass are plain John or Thomas, with a considerable
sprinkling of _Misters_--the master of olden times being an
addition of worship. The Captains and Majors of the list were
doubtless the officers of the train-bands, of no little historic
fame in London, from King John and Magna Carta even to John Gilpin.

The homes of many of the merchants named in this list were in the
suburbs of London, and there they seem to have transacted their
business, not in the City. We find them at Highgate, so well known
before as the residence of the philosophic Earl of Arundel, where
Lord Bacon died,--at Newington Green, Islington, Clerkenwell
Green, Hackney, Hogsden, Bethnall Green, Kingsland, Moorfields,
Spital-fields, and Mile End Green,--places now so many centres of
crowded population, not the sweet rural retreats, which we are
content to go for farther a-field, being, like our fathers, fully
awake to the delights of forest life.

The _Hogsden_ of the list (our Hoxton) is shown to have been
pretty full of merchants; and we know how delightful a group of
gardens that suburb possessed in the olden time. Not very long
after 1677, its worthy horticulturist Fairchild there practised
his art with eminent success; and not only founded the annual
sermon still preached by distinguished divines every year upon the
bounty of the Creator in the gifts of nature, but tried hard with
his pen to teach the citizens to adorn London with gardens. This
is a consideration well worth pursuing at this moment of London’s
revival. Her seventy graveyards, so long festering charnel-houses,
may, under wise direction, become centres of floral beauty and
instructive recreation to our youthful London population.

Some resided on “The Bridge,” the London Bridge for ages covered
with dwellings, from one of which the daughter of a rich citizen
fell into the Thames to be saved by the bold apprentice Osborne,
who married her, and founded the ducal family of Leeds.

The painted _portraits_ of the more distinguished of these
fathers of our trade would deserve a special study. Sir John
Houblon’s may be seen at the Bank of England; Benjamin Bathurst’s
is assuredly piously preserved by his ennobled family; Sir John
Tulse, who has left his name perpetuated on the picturesque hill
near the Crystal Palace, must have possessed good taste enough to
be a portrait-painter’s patron; and the letter in the Spectator
asserting our superior appreciation of that branch of art is well
justified in the numerous portraits scattered all over the land.
Our commerce is indeed exceedingly rich in materials of historical
portraiture, and in its products. Without ostentatiously boasting
of a superiority which is not to be pretended over the statesmen
who grace so many halls, our merchants, from the pencils of
Holbein and Antonio More down to the latest dates, may challenge
comparison with them. The City and its halls are full of them; and
Sir Thomas Gresham’s design of an university in London could not
be better revived and realized than by annexing a fine gallery of
merchants’ portraits to its other branches of instruction. It is
a good suggestion, that the profit got by the Treasury from the
sale of his estate in Broad Street to a Banking Company, should
be pursued to its legitimate issue,--the establishment of that
university.

The topic of Gresham’s University has some elucidation from the
list of 1677. Comparatively few merchants then resided in Broad
Street, or in Bishopsgate Street. Rents were therefore low in
that quarter. In 1760, when the Gresham property was sold, under
an Act of Parliament, for the Excise Office, its income was less
than 450_l._ a-year; and the government made it up to 500_l._ The
sale, however, to the Gresham Chambers’ Company, a few years since,
netted a very large sum to the Treasury. That surplus is believed
to revert to the trusts of Sir T. Gresham’s will, since the Acts
which have alienated the estate first from the Charity, and then
from the Crown, are mere parliamentary titles--quite secure to the
occupiers of the land, but not destructive of the rights of the
objects of a founder. The matter is indeed under serious scrutiny
before the Charity Commission; and it has special claims to the
fair consideration of Her Majesty’s prime minister.

The _John Temple_ of this list was probably of Lord Palmerston’s
lineage. The Palmers of the list, too, doubtless belonged to the
family which almost monopolises the Mercers’ Company--Gresham’s
trustees; and so Sir Roundell Palmer, the Solicitor-General, must
not desert his duty. Nor will he have forgotten his own labour
of love in Gresham’s lecture-room, when he helped his relative,
Professor Palmer, to do justice to his charge.

Earl Russell will not, on this occasion, refuse his powerful aid to
the improvement of the citizens of London, so often the defenders
of liberty, and the advocates of science. The City has indefeasible
claims upon Earl Russell’s sympathies--if for nothing more--for the
sad sacrifice of his great relative Lord William, led, from his
prison in the Tower, through the heart of the city to his scaffold
in Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields, in order to crush the spirit of a people
deeply attached to the house of Bedford.

Finally, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Gladstone, will
readily part with the large proceeds of the Gresham Charity-estate,
which, by all the calls of conscience, and the kindred rules
of equity, belong to an object which he, of all men, the most
approves--the liberal instruction of our youth.

The Harveys of the list are of a honoured stock. They are near
kinsmen to Dr. William Harvey, famous in medical history as the
discoverer of the circulation of the blood. He passed many of
the last years of his eventful life with his brother Eliab, the
merchant of London, who possessed “noble feats, and at least
3000_l._ a year,” says Aubrey. In those days the physicians, with
their College in Warwick Lane, may be held to have been citizens.
It was at the Royal Exchange that Drs. Mead and Ratcliffe fought
their well-known duel.

Three original copies of the list of 1677 are known. One is in the
Bodleian library; one in the Manchester Free Library, bought for
5_l._, (from this, owing to the kindness of R. W. Smiles, Esq., the
Librarian, the present reprint has been made); one was sold at the
sale of the Rev. Mr. Hunter’s library for 9_l._, although imperfect.

The volume--here reproduced as almost a fac-simile--is a curious
little precursor of the London Directory, grown from its first
edition of 1732 in 300 pages, to the huge volume, the Post Office
Directory of the present day.

In the Lambeth Library there is such a list in manuscript of thirty
years earlier date. It is a list of all the inhabitants of London
liable to pay tithes, with the amounts due from each.

During the progress of this little volume through the press a
most interesting fact relative to the history of trade has come
to light. It appears from an old pamphlet that an “_Office of
Addresses_” was started as early as 1650, by HENRY ROBINSON, a
well known writer on matters of commerce and finance during the
commonwealth period. The ideas of this worthy are so advanced
and sound that it is more than probable that Sir William Petty,
who soon after began to write upon these subjects, was indebted
to him for some of his liberal views with regard to the extension
of trade. Henry Robinson’s “Office in Threadneedle Street, over
against the Castle Tavern, close to the Old Exchange in London,”
comes out with a business-like precision in the very advertisement,
that promises well for his work--the keeping _particular registers
of all manner of addresses_. Then follows a catalogue of subjects
of inquiry, so copious and so curious as to be a new proof that
there is almost nothing new under the sun! _Sixpence_ was the fee,
and for this small sum answers to all sorts of questions connected
with business could be obtained. The whereabouts of merchants,
the arrivals or departures of ships, the current price of certain
commodities, were all to be ascertained by visiting this ancient
Inquiry Office--the crude off-shoot of a commerce struggling
to develope itself, and answering for a time the purposes of a
broker’s office, the Stock-Exchange, and the modern newspaper
teeming with trade advertisements.

PREFACE.

_To the Merchants and Traders of the City of_ London.


  _Gentlemen_,

Although the publishing of the ensuing Pamphlet (or Catalogue)
may at the first view, seem to several persons a ridiculous and
preposterous attempt, yet the Author of this poor Collection humbly
hopes, that it will not be exploded or rejected by you, for whose
ease and conveniency (together with your forein correspondents)
he principally intended it: And if it prove so successful as to
receive a favourable acceptance from your hands, the censure of all
other persons not concerned in the conveniency arising by it, will
not discourage the Author to proceed and make such Improvements
of this small _Embrio_, as may soon bring it to a perfect birth.
He humbly hopes no Apology will be required for such Errata’s or
Escapes as have been committed as to the Orthography, or true
writing of the respective Names of this Catalogue, as well for that
he hath found it a very difficult thing, to procure so ample an
Account of Names as he hath done; as also in regard his main design
is, to publish this forthwith, to the end that if those persons who
are concerned in the Use of it, do give it a favourable Receptance,
he may set forth an Additional Catalogue far more correct and
accurate; wherein if he may receive Encouragement accordingly,
he shall not in any thing be better satisfied than that his poor
Endeavours shall have answered those Ends for which they were
intended.

_Whereas, since the ensuing Tract was in the Press, the Author
hath discovered the Habitations of several other Merchants, not
comprehended in the Alphabetical Order; he hath therefore thought
fit (rather than to omit them) to insert them in the last Page of
this Book by themselves. And whereas the Author intends shortly to
Reprint this Catalogue, with additions; he doth therefore desire,
that for the better furtherance of the next Edition, all Merchants,
as well such as shall be newly arrived from beyond the Seas, as
also all such as shall be newly set up, would be pleased to give in
their Names and Habitations to_ Samuel Lee _Stationer, over against
the Church, near_ Popes-head Alley _in_ Lombard Street. _And if it
happen that any Omission shall be made of any Merchants Names in
this or the ensuing Edition, let the parties concerned repair to
the said_ Mr. Lee, _where they may probably receive satisfaction.
And if any Bill of Exchange happen to be drawn upon any Tradesmen
or Shopkeepers under the denomination of Merchants, if they repair
to the place aforesaid they may receive due Information._

  TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

  Many entries are out of alphabetical order. No change has been made.

  The 1863 Introduction has page numbering (v to xxii) but the Catalogue
  itself reproduced in the following 129 pages has no numbering.

  The letter ſ (long-form s) was used extensively but sometimes
  inconsistently in the book and has been replaced by the normal s in
  all cases in the etext.

  Some errors from the 1677 Catalogue were carried forward in the 1863
  reproduction and marked with [sic.] in the text. These have been left
  unchanged in the etext.

  The printer’s catchwords at the bottom of every page on the 1677
  Catalogue were carried forward in the 1863 text. These have all been
  removed in the etext.

  The capital letter of a name was italicized in over two hundred
  instances and was perhaps a printer’s artifact and not the 1677
  compiler’s choice. These have been left unchanged in the etext.

  A few instances of a clearly incorrect punctuation mark have been
  silently changed, for example ‘Mr,’ was changed to ‘Mr.’ Many
  instances of a missing comma, for example after the surname, have
  not been altered.

  All addresses were italicized and all names were not. A half dozen
  instances of italic inconsistency were silently changed.

  The ‘Goldsmiths’ section had two small lists under the letter ‘H’
  heading. These have been combined into one list.

  In the Introduction:
    Page xviii, ‘ia a good suggestion’ replaced by
                ‘is a good suggestion’.

  In the Catalogue entry with surname ‘xxxxx;’:
    Bultell; ‘Anstin-fryars’ replaced by ‘Austin-fryars’.
    Burdit; ‘Bobert’ replaced by ‘Robert’.
    Deluna; ‘Great Saint Hel-’ replaced by ‘Great Saint Hellens.’.
    Demodina; ‘Great St. Hel-’ replaced by ‘Great St. Hellens.’.
    Doggett; ‘Pouut. Hill’ replaced by ‘Pount. Hill’.
    Hill; ‘Rredriff’ replaced by ‘Redriff’.
    Vergrew; ‘Throgmortou street’ replaced by ‘Throgmorton street’.

        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
