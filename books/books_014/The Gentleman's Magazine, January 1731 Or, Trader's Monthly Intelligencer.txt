                            JANUARY, 1731.

             _A View of the WEEKLY ESSAYS in this Month._


_The Craftsman_, _by_ Caleb D’anvers _Esq;_ and Mr _Oldcastle_. Jan. 2.
No. 235.

Mr. _Oldcastle_ having begun his remarks on the conduct of the Kings
of _England_, to shew how the spirit of _Faction_, and the spirit of
_Liberty_ had exerted themselves at different times and occasions,
had brought his Observations down to the reign of Q. _Elizabeth_. He
begins No. 234, with an Eulogium upon her prudent conduct in the most
arduous difficulties that attended her accession to the Throne. These
difficulties he explains at large, and goes on No. 235, to speak more
largely of the means whereby she establish’d her glory and confirm’d
herself in the affections of her People. Her first principle was to be
neither _fear’d nor despis’d_ by those she govern’d. He mentions some
instances wherein she discover’d her wisdom in both these respects,
particularly in maintaining her _Prerogative_, which altho’ she was
fond of, yet took care it never should be grievous, or if it should
happen so to particular persons, that it should appear specious to the
publick. The effects, he says, of a bare-fac’d _Prerogative_ are not
so dangerous to _Liberty_ as the attempts which are made to surprize
and undermine it. Wherefore Q. _Eliz._ never kept up a _Standing
Army_, but placed her security in the affection of her People. With
respect to _parties_ he extols her moderation and equity, by which
conduct she stood on firmer ground, and had less to fear from the
spirit of _Faction_. She neither hastily espoused the party which she
favour’d, nor inflam’d the spirits of the adverse party. The _Papists_
and _Puritans_ she used with lenity, ’till their evil practices made
it necessary to execute rigours, and even then she distinguished
_Papists in conscience from Papists in Faction, nor condemn’d the Zeal
of the Puritans, but sometimes censured their Violence. He says from
~Cambden~, she bestowed her favours with so much caution, and so little
distinction, as to prevent either party from gaining the ascendant over
her, whereby she remained Mistress of her own self, and preserved both
their affections and her own power and authority entire._

He proceeds to justify Q. _Eliz._ from the imputation of avarice, by
observing that she neither hoarded up, nor was lavish of the publick
money. Quotes a saying of the famous _Burleigh_, that, _He never cared
to see the treasury swell like a disorder’d spleen, when the other
parts of the common-wealth were in a Consumption_; and his mistress
thought that _money in the pockets of her subjects was better than in
her own_.

It was her maxim to save for the publick not for herself, and to
measure her riches by the riches of the nation; refused supplies
offered, and remitted payment of supplies granted, when the publick
service did not require it. The two great principles of her Œconomy
were _1st._ Not suffering her Officers to enrich themselves by fraud
or clandestine management. _2d._ Never attempting to do any thing with
money that could be done with wisdom or courage. (_See p. 319._) For
which cites several instances; and observes how greatly she promoted
commerce, and increased the fleet of _England_, which before was
inconsiderable.


_Jan. 9._ Craftsman, No. 236.

All his oratory here is pointed at the person of a _certain great man_
whom he represents as affecting all the qualities and requisites of the
most consummate statesman, without any qualifications in him necessary
for so high a post. He ridicules him for a ready habit of _lying_,
because it is sometimes proper for a politician to conceal the truth:
Charges him with a dark mysterious proceeding on all Occasions, because
_secrecy_ is requir’d in a statesman, and adds, that ’tis a proof that
his secret services are great by the large sums requir’d for carrying
them on. Says, _good Intelligence_ is another excellent property in
an able statesman, and therefore our _mock-minister_ apes him in this
particular; gives a long detail of instances to illustrate what he
advances.

Confesses, indeed, that the fluctuation of affairs hath oblig’d the
ministry to go from _court to court_; to make treaties, which (as
obsrv’d by the author of the _London Journal_) _it is by no means
proper to execute_----and adds, _They found us engag’d in a treaty
with the Emperor; but they have very wisely vary’d from it----They
made a Treaty with ~France~; and have hitherto very wisely observ’d
it----they sent a large squadron of ships, with an hostile appearance,
and without any declaration of war, into the ~West-Indies~; but they
wisely gave the Admiral instructions not to make use of any other force
than perswasion----They sent another squadron into the ~Baltick~;
and a third into the ~Mediterranean~; but they very wisely gave the
Commanders of them the same pacifick instructions; even tho’ ~Spain~
was actually at war with us, and attacking one of our most valuable
possessions----They afterwards enter’d into a treaty with ~Spain~; but
they have hitherto very wisely declin’d to put it in execution; and if
they are now negotiating another treaty at ~Vienna~, as we have been
told, I doubt not that the same wisdom will appear in it, whether it
is design’d to be put in execution or not._

He concludes by reducing his harangue into a kind of problematical
order, and makes a great many bold interrogatories, and answering
of which, he imagines, would lay his opponents under the dilemma,
of disapproving their own conduct, or allowing the justness of his
arguments; such as these; _Will our M----r execute the treaty of
~Seville~, or will he not? would a Reconciliation at ~Vienna~, tho’
justifiable in other persons, be so in him? hath not the ~Emperor~
shewn that he does not fear us? will he not affect to show that he doth
not want us?_ and many other queries to the like purpose. See _London
Journal_ of the 16th. p. 6, 7. and _Free Briton_ of the 14th, p. 16, 17.


Craftsman, _Jan. 16._ No. 237.

Complains of the hardship that the authors of the _Craftsman_ lye
under; that a certain gentleman makes use of his authority to restrain
their pens, while he employs others to throw about scandal at random;
and others are suffer’d to call the authors of the _Craftsman_,
traytors and villains!

Makes some reflections on the _London Journal Jan. 9._ which had took
to pieces his _Hague_ Letter, concerning the report of a negotiation at
_Vienna_.

Mr _Osborne_ in the _London Journal_ having exposed a paradox from
the _Craftsman_, that the ministry are never right; when they do what
the _Craftsmen_ count wrong: and yet wrong, when they do what the
_Craftsmen_ count right; the _Craftsman_ observes, that ’tis allow’d
that an accommodation with the Emperor is a right measure, but attended
with fatal consequences, and almost insuperable difficulties; because
such measures might be resented by other courts as an infraction of
treaties, which Mr. _Osborne_ says, were only occasional and temporal.

The _Craftsman_ supposes these alliances to be such, but then asks,
Will our allies understand ’em in the same sense! If not, what may be
the consequences?

As to what the _Craftsman_ had granted, that the fulness of time
was come to desert one ally, and to Mr. _Osborne_’s reasons for
such desertion, he replies by demanding, Whether it was not equally
reasonable long ago?

_Osborne_ had ask’d----if upon the non-execution of this treaty,
occasion’d by the different views of the allies, another court should
grow stubborn, what must we do? This the _Craftsman_ answers by another
question, that is, Whether the different views of the allies do not
proceed from their different interests?


Craftsman, _Jan. 23._ No. 238.

From the Minutes of Mr. _Oldcastle_.

This paper continues remarks on Q. _Elizabeth_’s reign; and is a long
_Encomium_ on her management of treaties with foreign powers, which she
always conducted in such a manner as was best suited to the good of her
people and the honour and dignity of the nation. Her _Ministry_ went
wisely and steadily on to their own great purposes _of preserving the
peace of ~Europe~, and the trade and prosperity of the Kingdom._ (_See_
_Free Brit._ p. 8, 326.)


Craftsman, _Jan. 30._ No. 239.

Maintains the liberty of the _Press_, in opposition to those who argue
for the necessity of _some_ restraint, which, if granted, he says,
might be made use of to destroy all newspapers whatsoever, except the
_Gazette_.

After repeating most of the points in debate, he defends his _Hague_
letter (for which the government thought fit to call him to an account)
in as much as there was nothing in it asserted, but only supposed;
and adds, he has as much right to reason upon suppositions as Mr.
_Osborne_; and to censure the conduct of ministers, as he hath to
approve it; for unless the right is reciprocal, the liberty of the
press is no liberty at all.

As to what Mr. _Walsingham_ had allow’d, that we have a right to reason
upon political affairs, tho’ not to lay down false facts; he replies,
that he has asserted no falsehoods, and only exercised the natural
right of every _Free Briton_, to offer his opinion on affairs.

Concludes with saying, that if he should be call’d upon to defend
himself in a court of justice he must submit to the law; and abide the
judgment of his country. _See_ p. 298.


London Journal. _Jan. 2._ No. 596. against the _Craftsman_, No. 233.

The _Craftsman_ having in his said _Journal_ advanced several arguments
for the disbanding the _Army_ and repealing the _Riot Act_, the Author
of the _London Journal_ undertakes here to confute them. He admits that
a Government ought to have no more power than is necessary for the
safety and protection, the preservation and happiness of the people,
but adds that the laws alone, without a power to execute, and provide
against all sudden emergencies, and possible dangers, will not answer
these ends. Asserts that the possibility of powers being abused is not
a sufficient reason to strip the Government of such a security, or to
lodge the safety of the King in the affections of the people, which
are variable and easily seduced, and (as the _Craftsman_ allows) very
precarious, when he makes a doubt whether his present Majesty enjoys
them. Not only _Armies_ and _Riot Acts_, but even the very law itself,
by ill designing men may be used for our destruction, which were made
for our safety. But must we part with the law, because we may suffer by
the law? Every nation round us is arm’d, and must we alone stand naked
and defenceless? If the liberties of many nations have been destroy’d
by _standing armies_, the liberties of many have been preserv’d by
them. Mentions the _Revolution_ as an instance, and believes the Pr.
of _Orange_ would not have so easily succeeded, had the army been as
true to the King as they were to their country. That the disbanding
the army after the peace of _Riswick_ embolden’d the _French King_ to
set his Grandson on the Throne of _Spain_, and declare the Pretender,
which involv’d us in a ten years war: That nothing more intimidated the
Ministry in the last four years of Q. _Anne_’s reign, than the honesty
and bravery of the gentlemen of the army.

As to the riot act, he says that power is necessary to prevent riots
and tumults, and to disperse the people when so assembled. To this
purpose a law is made which tells them the consequences of it; a proper
officer gives them warning; and if after this they will stay and be
hang’d, ’tis their own fault.

He allows, that shou’d a Justice of the peace assume the liberty of
reading the proclamation where a member of parliament is chusing, he
ought to be hang’d. He don’t see how this act can injure us any other
way; for while the constitution is preserv’d, and our liberties taken
care of by the government, the people can’t be unjustly hurt by it.

The remaining part of his discourse is spent in setting forth the
unreasonableness of repealing this act, from the behaviour of the
authors of the _Craftsman_ and their abettors, who by their conduct in
exciting uneasiness in the people, have made it necessary to continue
it in force.


_London Journal_, _Jan. 9_, No. 597.

Contains remarks upon a paper in the _Craftsman_, called, _An extract
of a letter from the ~Hague~_.

The author begins with observing, that tho’ the pretence of the
_Craftsman_ is liberty and patriotism, yet his real design is
opposition to the court.

He then reflects on the _Craftsman_’s incoherent way of arguing, just
as it serves to vent his spleen; for according to him the ministry are
never right when they do what he counts wrong, and always wrong when
they do what the _Craftsman_ counts right.

When we were broken with the Emperor we were quite wrong, and now we
are going to unite with the Emperor we are equally wrong.

This paper, or letter, the _Journalist_ says, is made up of mere
conjectures, and suppositions; or else insinuations, unsupported by
facts or reason: justifies our ministry from the aspersion that we are
undoing what we have been doing these five years; and insists that
we have been continuing to do the same thing, that is, pursuing the
peace and happiness of the nation by different means, as alterations
happen’d, or circumstances varied.

He then answers the _Craftsman_’s charge of deserting one ally, by
supposing that this ally may have views inconsistent with the two
other allies, and so stand disposed to act contrary to the design of
that treaty and our interest. _England_ is not obliged to execute the
treaty, unless the other allies will act their part.

The _Craftsman_ charges the ministry with obstinate perseverance in
bad measures, and now with a precipitate alteration of councils. This
the author of this _Journal_ denies, and says, it should be more
justly called, a wise and prudent accommodating themselves to the late
unfortunate juncture of affairs. Changing hands is not an alteration of
councils, but a conduct which wise and honest men ought to observe.


_London Journal_, _Jan. 16._ No. 598.

_Reflections on the present State of Affairs, occasion’d by the
~Craftsman~, Jan. 9._

He takes notice of the _Craftsman_’s method of drawing of characters,
in which he offends all the laws of honesty, propriety and decorum;
charges without evidence or reason, and without common sense; makes
his _Mock-minister_ a composition of insolence, malice, and a small
talent for ridicule, yet is not half so odious as the _Mock-patriot_
who drest him; who, while he counterfeits publick virtue, is infamously
abusing the publick: clothes himself with the love of his country,
while he is making a jest of it; and injures the community, while he
pretends the highest regard for it; and who, because we have tried all
possible ways to preserve the peace, calls our ministers _Dupes_ of all
the powers of _Europe_, _political Mendicants_, strolling about from
court to court.

The _Craftsman_ having advanc’d, that we are inexcuseable for not
having foreseen and prevented these conjunctures in which nothing can
be done which is not a fault to do; our author asks, what conjunctures
those are, in which a man is not at liberty to act reasonably and
honestly? or can it be a fault so to act?

By the treaty of _Seville_ we only yielded to _Spain_ a point, which,
in real interest, concerned some of the contending powers. It could
hardly be imagin’d that the Emperor would have put himself to the
expence, or hazard of a war, for the small deviation of the _Quadruple
Alliance_, had he not been informed, that the allies could not agree
about the war; or that they disagreed about the scene of action; or,
for the sake of peace, the allies might all concur to wait _one Year_
to see what the Emperor would do. Any of these suppositions affords a
reason why the treaty of _Seville_ is not yet executed.

As to the queries put by the _Craftsman_, (p. 4.) they are all ask’d
for the sake of the two last, which demand, Will not this measure of
making up with the Emperor be attended with worse consequences than
turning out the minister? and----Will the objections against it, be so
strong, if manag’d by another hand?----he answers no; for persons don’t
alter the relation of things, or change the nature of actions. If it
is reasonable, ’tis equally so whoever does it.


_London Journal_, _Jan. 23._ No. 599.

By the behaviour of the ministry for some years past, it evidently
appears, that the preserving the peace of _Europe_, and securing the
trade and prosperity of the kingdom, has been their greatest concern;
but whether means taken to that end have been always right, is not so
easily determin’d.

The sword indeed might have cut our way to peace, and added to our
glory, but the event might have prov’d a general war.----Our ministry
thought wisdom better than power. To this end, when our enemies arm’d
we put ourselves in a posture of defence; we suffer’d little insults,
as a proof that we were willing to be _one_ with a nation with whom
it is our interest to be _one_. To this end we united those who were
disjoin’d, and separated those who were united; still avoiding a war.

But while the ministry have been industrious in preventing confusions,
and watching opportunities of accommodating differences, their
adversaries have practis’d all imaginary ways to insult and embarrass
them.

_Osborne_ clears himself from the imputation which the _Craftsman_ had
charg’d him with, _viz._ that the supposition that we are going to
unite with the Emperor, will be attended with perfidy, infraction of
treaties, and violation of faith.


_London Journal_, _Jan. 30._ No. 600.

This Journal contains observations on Mr. _Oldcastle’s_ minutes of
Q. _Elizabeth_’s reign, which he affirms is a collection of _Scraps_
without order or method, coherence or connexion, being sounds without
sense, confusedly thrown at the present administration. _See_ p. 3.

Admits that this Queen was a wise and glorious Princess, but says that
our _Constitution_, and the _exercise of Power at home_, is vastly
better than what they were in her reign, and our _Foreign Affairs_
transacted with as much wisdom.

Quotes Mr. _Oldcastle_’s own words, in which he describes the _Wisdom_
and _Address_ of Q. _Elizabeth_, to describe the _Wisdom_ and _Address_
of the present Minister in negotiating _Foreign Affairs_. (See p. 3.)

Lastly, he gives several maxims out of _Cambden_ and _Francis
Osborne_’s memoirs of this Queen, such as her preferring peace to war;
her delaying resentment of injuries till proper seasons; her judgment
of her subjects abilities, which she dextrously fitted for her favours
and their employments; her steady resolution not to ransom herself from
her enemies at the price of their preferments who lov’d her.


_Fog’s Journal_, _Saturday, January 9._ No. 120.

A Letter is inserted, containing remarks on Mr. _Chubb_’s discourse
concerning _Reason_, in which is asserted, that _it either is, or ought
to be a sufficient guide in matters of Religion_.

This Proposition the remarker explains in the words of Mr. _Chubb_, and
assents to, and then proceeds to consider it more particularly. Does
not comprehend Mr. _Chubb_’s observation, i. e. _The Question is not
whether there be absolutely such a capacity in man_: for if man has
such a capacity, as Mr. _Chubb_ insists, he may be truly said to be
the possessor of it. Nor can the remarker understand the sense of that
clause, _he ought to have_, because it has no relation to the dispute
between Mr. _Chubb_ and the Bp of _London_, i. e. what man _now_ has,
and is capable of.

The remarker goes on to shew, that the author’s argument to prove
that man _ought_ to have such a capacity, is needless, because it is
universally assented to.

Mr. _Chubb_ argues, _That as our species was no ways accessary to
~Adam’s~ transgression, ’tis unreasonable and unequal that they should
suffer by it._

To this is answer’d, that there are other difficulties in the general
scheme of providence as hard to be solved; as that, whole families
are involved in misery by the mismanagement of their ancestor; the
entailment of chronick and terrible disorders on children by the
debaucheries of a father, for that it is _wrong intolerable_, and
against reason to punish children for the crimes of their fathers. But
all these difficulties which seem to clash with the wisdom and goodness
of God, are rectify’d in a future state, for which we are manifestly
fitted and design’d.


_Fog’s Journal_, _Jan. 16._ No. 121.

This paper begins with a piece of humourous irony; observing that as
criticks never appear so disappointed as when they meet with beauties
in an author; so the present sett of disaffected political writers
conceive no small joy to see their country involv’d in difficulties;
nor can they be worse mortified than to see this nation flourish in
trade, wealth and credit.

That _Osborne_ (writer of the _London Journal_) and _Walsingham_ (of
the _Free Briton_) affirm, That the present crew of factious writers
proceeds on this principle. Descants upon the measures for some years
past; the destruction of the _Spanish_ Fleet in the _Mediterranean_,
whereby _Sicily_ was gain’d for the Emperor, and the preservation
of the balance of _Europe_ so ill settled by that wicked treaty of
_Utrecht_.

Mentions some of the great Actions which have stirr’d up the envy of
the disaffected; as, the sending annual fleets into the _Baltick_;
the treaty of _Hanover_; the maintaining a body of _Hessian_ troops;
sending squadrons to the coasts of _Spain_ and the _West-Indies_, the
expedition to _Spithead_ and lastly, the treaty of _Seville_. This
last, he ironically says, had like to have kill’d the disaffected
quite, because it was so wisely calculated for establishing a general
tranquillity, and for the advancing the trade of _Great Britain_!

He goes on throwing his sarcasms at the writers on the side of the
present ministry, who having challeng’d the disaffected to show any one
step taken destructive of the true interest of their country, instances
in the opening the harbour of _Dunkirk_, the Island of St. _Lucia_
planted by the _French_; raising recruits in _Ireland_ for the service
of _France_; all which the two writers aforemention’d, convinced the
world were groundless, by telling the authors of these reports, they
lyed.

He makes some reflections on Mr. _Osborne_’s observations of the ill
conduct of the ministry in the latter end of Q. _Anne_’s reign; as the
endeavours to break the power of the Dissenters, and to weaken the
security of the _Hanover_ succession; setting aside the _Quaker_’s
affirmation; the disbanding the army. All which _Fog_ laughs at! and
concludes with his surprize, that when he considers with how much
good sense these two writers have exposed the actions of that _Tory_
ministry, and how they have defended the measures of the present, there
should be a disaffected person left in the kingdom.


Fog’s Journal, _Jan. 23._ No. 123.

This Paper consists of reflections on a pamphlet, intituled, _A Defence
of the Measures of the present Administration_.

He begins with the observation which the author had made: “That
complaints and outcries are no foundation for supposing defects in
publick counsels; for in a frame of government like ours, a continuance
of the same administration will always lessen the popularity of the
ministry.

“The frequent use of this observation, _Fog_ says, is enough to shew
its good sense. ’Twas first started by the Rev. Author of the Enquiry,
all the anniversary pamphlets have had it since, and it has been
repeated by Mr. _Osborne_ 75 times; by Mr. _Walsingham_ twice as many;
nor is there any thing in this pamphlet but what has the authority of,
at least, 50 repetitions”: yet he cannot subscribe to his opinion; for
supposing it true, it is a sure sign that affairs are well conducted;
but if the contempt of all men of sense be added to this clamour, oh!
then we pronounce him an angel.

He goes on to quote another passage; “That the Peace of _Utrecht_
left us on good terms with _Spain_, which might have turn’d to our
advantage, had our affairs been wisely manag’d in the late reign; but
as they were not, it laid the foundation of the several perplexities
that have since attended us.”

This conduct of the last reign, _Fog_ says, ought to be apply’d to a
person or two since dead, and not to the present ministers. Adds, that
he might have spar’d his encomium of the _Utrecht_ treaty, or shewn us
the folly of cultivating a good understanding with the _Emperor_ and
_Spain_ at the same time, by which our affairs, every where were left
in _a stupid calm_; for had they contriv’d to make either of ’em our
enemy, we should always have had a quarrel and a treaty depending, and
so have given vent to our humours and money too.

The author having said, that when the present ministry came into power,
they observ’d from the complexion of things mischief must be gath’ring
some where, which prov’d to be an alliance betwixt _Spain_ and the
_Emperor_. This, _Fog_ affirms, was very sagacious; but that the treaty
he speaks of was, and still is deny’d by both the parties.

He then criticises on several other parts of the discourse, especially
on those which extol the conduct of our ministry and their management
of our affairs, relating to the inaction of the squadron sent to
the _West Indies_, and keeping back the _Spanish_ Treasure, thereby
rendring it useless, as to any dangerous purposes.

The wisdom of this conduct, _Fog_ takes notice, proved itself in the
Event; The _Spaniards_ were provoked; sent out their privateers, and
pillag’d our merchants!

As to humouring the Q. of _Spain_ in settling the _Italian_ dukedoms on
Don _Carlos_, says, sneeringly, besides obliging a fair Lady, _Great
Britain_ has gain’d the treaty of _Seville_!


Fog’s Journal, _Jan. 30._ No. 124.

_The Press_, says he, _has lately swarm’d with writing ~pro~ and
~con~, upon the present posture of affairs, by which we find that one
party is of opinion, that ministers of state are no more than ~men~;
t’other will have ’em to be ~angels~ (that is while they continue in
power.)----Here you read, that Affairs are in no better situation than
they should be----there, that we have neither past miscarriages, or
present grievances to complain of, and that the nation never was in so
flourishing a condition. One ~D’Anvers~, and, if I mistake not, one
~Fog~, are accused of seditiously asserting that a ~Crow~ is black, but
the writers on the other side, have with infinite Wit, proved a ~black
Crow~ to be the ~whitest~ bird of all the feather’d kind._

He proceeds thus merrily to remark on a pamphlet intitled,
_Considerations on the present state of affairs, with regard to the
Number of Forces in the Pay of ~Great Britain~_; and endeavours, in his
ironical way, to overthrow the several arguments advanced by the author
for maintaining the _Hessian_ troops, and concludes with giving his
opinion that they will be very far from convincing the disaffected.


The Grub-street Journal, _Thursday, Jan. 14._ No. 53.

Dr. _Quibus_ chuses for the subject of his discourse the operation
designed to be performed on the ears of one _Rey_, a condemn’d
malefactor, by Mr. _Cheselden_. This he treats in a ludicrous manner,
and supposes that if Mr. _Rey_ should prove so unphilosophical as to
give the surgeon the slip as soon as the operation is over, we should
be as much in the dark as we were before. He declares his opinion, that
not only the drum, but the whole organ, or the ear it self, is of no
use at all in hearing, and would know the truth of his conjecture by
seeing the ears of some malefactor entirely extirpated. Recommends it
as a thing of great use, if instead of executing malefactors they were
made to undergo such kind of experiments. Trial may be made whether
the _Retina_ of the eye is of any use in seeing. A needle might be
introduced into the eye, and the _Retina_ quite remov’d. The spleen
might be taken out of some vile malefactor, and an observation made
whether their inclinations to evil courses depend not on a superfluity
of the _Atra Bilis_. Another experiment he recommends as of great
consequence, that is, whether the tying up one of the testicles would
not determine the sex of a child begotten at such a time. By this
means, he says, many illustrious families might be inform’d of a just
and certain method of obtaining an heir to their estates. _See_ p. 19.


The Grub-street Journal, _Thursday, Jan. 14._ No. 54.

The author begins with the _Laureat_’s new-year’s ode (for which see p.
20.) and subjoins to it some explanatory notes; the substance of which
is contain’d in the following short remarks.

_Line_ 1. The eternity of the world is here maintain’d, tho’ Dr.
_Clarke_ had objected against it.

3. Old _Janus_, a heathenish emblem, is supplanted by _old Time_, as
more familiar to christian readers.

5. To this is objected, making _Spring a living person calling for
birth_ as it were to _old Time_; whereas _old Time_ had bid _spring
pass_, so no occasion for _spring to call_. Which is defended thus;
When _time bids spring pass_, it might not be ready, but as soon as it
was, it _calls for birth_.

Line 7. _Harvest_ in _summer_ is very early, and something unusual.

9. But not soon enough, it seems, because here _each season_ is said
_to bring ~THEIR~ stores ~TO~ winter’s wants, ~till~ warmer genial suns
recall the spring_----However Mr. _Cibber_’s authority makes it current.

15. An admirable improvement of _Nocte pluit tota_, &c. which to set in
a true light is translated and imitated:

    _It rains all night, the shows returns with day:_
    _Thus ~Jove~ and ~Cæsar~ bear divided sway._

    _Plenty is Heav’n’s, and Peace our Monarch’s care,_
    _Thus ~Jove~ and ~George~ divided Empire share._

But to this was objected, that we are not only indebted to heaven for
_plenty_, but for _peace_ too, tho’ like marriages said to be made
there, it was not yet come down.

21. It is queried what _war_ and _peace_ the poet means here.

22. An emendation of this line is offer’d to make it clear,

    _We triumph most when ~MOST~ the farmer feeds._

and the _Beef eaters at ~St.~ James_’s, are appeal’d to for the
justness of it.

23, 24. The elegance of these lines are literally defended, but the
propriety and cadence of them are called in question.

25, 26, 27, 21. These seem inconsistent with the 19th and 20th verses.

As in the 35th, and 46th lines, _Phœbus_ had roll’d in vain, till
_Albion_ could behold such a sight as at present on the throne, well
might the poet make the exclamation in the 37th and 38th.

39, 40. As it is impossible always to REACH _our own desires_,
tho’ required by heaven, it is proposed to alter it to TEACH; that
is, instruct united hearts to address the throne by their own loyal
_desires_.

41. Read _selfish_, as better than _self-born_; all views whatever
being such.

46. _Suns_ probably should be read _sons_, because it seems to be a
contradiction to ever circling _sun_, line 1.

The criticiser concludes with observing, that when a song is good
sense, it must be made nonsense before it is made musick; so when a
song is nonsense, there’s no other way but by singing it to make it
seem tolerable sense.


_Grub-street Journal_, _Jan. 21._ No. 55.

The author begins with observing that nothing has increased their
society so much as poetry: We are taught it at school; if not, believe
we are born poets. Every corner abounds with its professors; the
bellman nightly salutes his master and mistress: the marshal, his
gentlemen soldiers every Christmas; every street rings with ballads;
the royal palace resounds with odes; and every church-yard with its
productions: _Stephen Duck_’s good fortune has occasion’d a poor Weaver
in _Spittle-fields_ to publish a miscellany of poems which he addresses
to the Queen, and introduces with this line.

    _Thy fortune, ~Duck~, affects my kindred mind;_

Wherefore _Grub st._ presumes to represent to her Majesty, that
the best way to encourage the Weaver, would be to wear British
manufactures; and the thresher, by giving him a small farm in the
country; and to restrain both from writing a line more in rhime or
measure.

Apprehends, that from this general inclination to write, they shall be
oblig’d, like the royal society, to discourage intruders amongst them,
and, to prevent misunderstanding, proposes that no person shall be a
member of both societies at the same time.


_Grub-street Journal_, _Jan. 21._ No. 56.

Makes some remarks concerning the management of controversies between
the political writers. This he illustrates by two examples; by which
he would intimate the spirit that animates and governs both parties.
The first is a quotation of two severe personal characters, from a
pamphlet entitled _Sedition and Defamation display’d, in a Letter to
the Author of the Craftsman_. The other is some paragraphs attacking
two characters on the opposite side, drawn from the Pamphlet call’d,
_A proper reply to a late scurrilous libel intitled Sedition and
Defamation display’d; in a Letter to the author, by Caleb D’anvers
Esq;_ which four characters he supposes imaginary, for if they were
real, no man of sense, honour, or honesty would espouse them.


Weekly Register, _Jan. 9._ No. 39.

The _Register_ publishes a mystical letter from a club of Gardners,
wherein is figuratively describ’d the evils which the fraternity
have occasionally suffer’d from the depredations _of Locusts_,
_Palmer-worms_, _Caterpillars_, and other pestiferous vermin. Several
discourses were made by the members concerning the Origin and Progress
of these their common enemies. One of the company said, that the
first appearance of them is in a sort of spawn, spread over the
cabbage-leaves, which gradually rises into _Grubs_. This _Grubbean_
race, he reckons, are descendants of the _Egyptian Locusts_, and
the _Palmer-worms_ and _Caterpillars_, a spurious offspring of the
_Locusts_. Another of the society believes they are of an _English_
extraction; gives several significations of the word _Grub_, and then
runs a parallel between the insects called _Grubs_, and the _Grubean
Society, or Grubstreet Journalists_. To which he adds a remark, that
’tis something strange a body of Men should set themselves up to make
a merit of other men’s faults: they must of course be despicable
themselves, because they take a pleasure in making others appear so.

Remembers that in the late wartime many postscripts to the
_Flying-Posts_ were bawl’d about with abundance of news, but scarce a
word of truth: So that paper gain’d the name of the _Lying Post_, and
was called _Grub-street News_. And still it’s a common appellation,
when we hear full and true accounts cry’d by our doors, _’tis
Grubstreet, all Grubstreet_.


Weekly Register, Jan. 16. No. 40.

On _Ridicule_, address’d to the authors of the _Grubstreet-Journal_.

_Says, Ridicule is a general practice, and proceeds either from the
wantonness of our own vanity, or contempt of others frailties. We take
the same pleasure in scandal as monkies do in mischief. Wonders why
the Tea-table should be thought the mother of scandal, or the nurse
of ridicule, when all mankind is pursuing the same pleasure under
different disguises. They condemn Censure in others, that they may
indulge it themselves. The taverns are as accessary to it as private
houses. Courts are esteemed the source of politeness and good manners;
theatres of ingenuity, churches of sanctity; yet all are infected with
the evil of scandal. Seems to prefer the gaming-table as freest from
irony and slander; avarice being a spirit that allows of no rival.
This vice is contagious, and runs thro’ the whole people: it wanders
every where, like an ~ignis fatuus~, and is only at home in the
~Grubstreet-Journal~._

_Don’t pretend how far this libertinism of speech is allowable, but is
certain that every moral man will use it only for the sake of him he
censures; and every gentleman will make good manners the only rule of
behaviour. All men are jealous of their characters, and we must have a
due complaisance for one frailty while we would reform another; for
the insolence of knowledge is as insupportable as the affectation of
folly. The subjects of ridicule are to be justly chosen and carefully
distinguished._

_Concludes with some Reflections on the authors of the
~Grubstreet-Journal~, who have undertaken the drudgery of invective
under pretence of being champions for politeness._


Weekly Register, _Jan. 24._ No. 41.

He remarks, that from an ambition of emulating, without a capacity
to equal another’s excellencies, have arisen an infinite number of
pretenders to reputation. The regular physician is intruded upon by
the empyrick; the masterly painter is slighted in favour of impudence
and ignorance; the most elegant and chaste compositions of musick, are
forc’d to give way to amusements less polite: Quackery interferes with
trade, and undermines honesty. The pedlar stiles himself a merchant;
No wonder then that authors of every character are so wretchedly
personated. Exclaims against bad writers, from the Court-scribbler to
the _Grubstreet_ hackney.

Proceeds to the description of a good author; says, his principal end,
in occasional writings, should be to entertain the publick innocently
and genteely; to insinuate knowledge in the disguise of amusement,
and trifle the world into virtue and good manners: he should consider
every reader as a critick and a gentleman, and be earful of offending
either: points out what a writer should observe, who would recommend
himself and entertain the world; _i. e._ an important subject, a clear
and expressive method, a flowing and natural stile, imagination and
judgment, truth and impartiality, modesty in his images, pity for the
failings of human nature, and endeavours to amend ’em. He shou’d think
himself a son of the publick and be an example of the generous spirit
he would recommend; he should be able to race the passions thro’ all
their disguises; have knowledge in his head, and good humour in his
heart: he should be an enemy to vice, but a friend to all mankind.


Weekly Register, _Jan. 30._ No. 42.

This is a continuation of a former discourse upon criticism, wherein he
points out several excellencies that distinguish a good critick from a
bad.

He then considers the manner of criticism, that some are _Fox-hunters_
in censure, and declare war against all writers in general. Some are
like _Fig_ and _Sutton_, the declar’d antagonists to one another. Some
are _Whigs_ and _Tories_, divided into parties, always applauding
themselves, and condemning their opposers. Some are _Grubstreet_
hawkers, who make a penny of throwing about censure at random without
distinction or regard of persons.

The design of criticism is amendment; and concludes with acknowledging
his own failings, and his readiness to be handsomely corrected.


The Universal Spectator, _Saturday Jan. 2._ No. 117.

    _Great wits to madness nearly are ally’d_
    _And thin partitions do their bounds divide._

                                         Dryden.

Mr. _Stonecastle_, the nominal author, begins this day’s entertainment
with observing that men are not born for themselves; that we are
not only bound to relieve the necessities of others, but in all our
dealings, _&c._ with mankind to render ourselves grateful to all,
offensive to none, much less take pleasure in doing disagreeable
things. Says there is a sett of people who are frequently committing
ill-bred, rude, and even shocking things, which they excuse by only
saying, ’tis their humour. Instances in a certain knight, who never
spoke himself, nor suffer’d any body in his presence to speak louder
than to be barely heard; insomuch that his servants, as they were
accustom’d to be mutes at home, behav’d like no body when they came
abroad.

His nephew _Silvio_, just come from the university, declaims on every
subject you can mention, and imagines himself master of every science.
Whatever is the topick of discourse, he will suffer no body to talk
upon it but himself; his uncle has but one hope of curing him of his
folly, that is, by engaging him to talk of maritime affairs before
captain _Firebal_ of the _Tempest_, who, very probably, will beat him
into better manners.

Beauty itself loses its attraction when accompanied with these humours.

_Artemisa_ is exquisitely handsome, but takes the liberty of abusing
every body at random, by asking ill-natur’d questions, and being witty
upon others imperfections: excuses herself by saying, ’tis her way to
tell unlucky truths and she can’t help it.

_Crito_ is a man of sense, learning, and accuracy of judgment; but this
ought not to privilege him to treat every writer he does not like with
opprobrious language.

_Belliza_ has wit and beauty, accompanied with a solid judgment. Yet
all this will hardly palliate the disgust she gives people with whom
she eats. She never uses a fork, is be-greased up to the knuckles, and
by her immoderate taking of snuff, which frequently falling among her
sauce, she gives her guests their bellies full before they have half
din’d. Concludes with a merry story of a certain Colonel, whose flight
it was, when he had drank a glass or two too much, to fire off and play
tricks with his pistols. One night the col. having drank too freely
order’d, his footman, who was an _Irishman_ newly hired, to bring his
pistols, _Teague_ obey’d; the Col. loaded them both, and having lock’d
the door commanded his man to hold one of the candles at arm’s length,
till he snuff’d it with a ball. Prayers and intreaties were in vain,
and comply he must, and did, tho’ trembling; the Col. perform’d the
operation at the first attempt, then laying down his pistols was going
to unlock the door. _Teague_ catches up that which was loaded, ‘Arra
Maishter, says he, but now you must take up t’other candle, and let me
have my shoot too.’ The col. call’d him rogue and rascal to no purpose,
_Teague_ was now vested with power, and would be obey’d: Accordingly
his master extended the candle, but this being the first time of
_Teague_’s performing, he not only miss’d, but shot off a button from
the breast of the colonel’s coat. So narrow an escape had a good
effect, and cur’d him of this humour of turning marksman in his drink.


The Universal Spectator, _Jan. 9._ No. 118.

Contains two Letters, with the _Spectator’s_ answers to them.

The first is from a gentleman, who, about three months since, fell
passionately in love with a lady at a ball; gives an account of his
courtship, and of the kind reception of his addresses during that time,
till of a sudden, without any reason given, or objection made, the lady
sent him a peremptory message to desist any further pursuit. Complains
that ’tis ungenerous and unjust to keep people so long in suspence,
with no design but to gratify female pride and vanity.

To this the _Spectator_ replies, That the lady gave him fair play, and
an opportunity of rendring himself agreeable; which when she found he
could not, she very civilly, by a third person, desir’d him to desist.
However, he says, ’tis but reasonable that the lady should give him a
certificate of his good behaviour during his courtship.

The second letter is from a young lady of 15, who signs herself
_Carolina_, which may be summ’d up and comprized in those two queries.

1. _May a Woman entertain several lovers at the same time?_

2. _After a Woman has once receiv’d a man’s addresses, may she with
honour turn him off?_

To the first he answers, _That such a licence might be granted, if
nothing was design’d by it but the chusing of the most deserving for
a husband; but considering the inconveniences that would necessarily
attend such an indulgence, he durst not allow it._

The second query he grants in the affirmative; that is, _if she
discovers him false and base, or uncapable of making her happy_.


Universal Spectator, _January, 16._ No. 119.

Contains a letter from a physician, in which he describes the miserable
condition of his patients, that apply to him on the _venereal_ account.
Of this sort the most unfortunate and pitiful object is a woman of the
town, who, if not quite abandon’d, gives a loose to her passion on such
occasions. The consideration of her past, present, and future state,
fills her with distraction, and involves her in endless evils, from
which death only can deliver her.

Proceeds to argue with the infamous authors of the misery of these
wretches, who first seduce the poor young creatures from their
innocence, and then triumph in their wickedness. He who debauches a
maiden, and then exposes her to want and shame, is arrived to such a
monstrous height of villany, that no word in our language can reach
it. Mentions a further species of cruelty, that is, the necessity
some of these poor wretches are under, if with child, of applying to
a magistrate to procure some pitiful maintenance for her unfortunate
babe.----When all that is to be done by the father, is to make the best
bargain he can with the church-wardens to take it off his hands; which
is commonly done for a treat, and 10 or 12_l._ So the child is placed
upon the parish, and the woman upon the town.


Univers. Spectator, _Jan. 23._ No. 120.

Entertains his readers with two letters; the first is from _Tristitia
Stale_, who complains that she is continually persecuted, merely
because she is an old maid.

Virginity, she says, has not always been a reproach, sees no
encouragement in matrimony, and begs the _Spectator_ to reprimand the
malaperts, who ridicule chastity; adds, that a single life in woman was
esteem’d among the ancient as well as modern Romans; vestals then, and
nuns now.

The other letter is from _Charlotte Wilful_, a young lady of 19,
who says she has two admirers. The first is ’squire _Scrape_, who
has 1200_l._ _per annum_, which he keeps in his own hands and farms
himself, and therefore is favour’d in his pretentions by her father.

Mr _Myrtle_, her mother’s favourite, is the other, who, by his own
account is near 40, by that of his acquaintance 10 years older, has
squander’d away a good estate, but by the death of an uncle is now
worth 1000_l._ _per annum_, and is a perfect humourist.

But to both these she prefers Mr _Plume_ of the _Inner-Temple_, who
has no estate, but is of a sweet temper. Concludes with desiring Mr
_Stonecastle_ to declaim on parents making choices for their Children,
with a stroke on antiquated beaus, and rural animals, and to recommend
a fine gentleman with no fortune. Desires, by way of postscript, that
he would not delay publishing her letter, because Mr _Plume_ and she
had agreed to run away together on _Tuesday_ next.


The Universal Spectator, _Jan. 30._ No. 121.

Among all those amusements people find to pass away the time, _Poesy_
and _Musick_ are the most elegantly entertaining. By the ancients they
were look’d upon as immediately inspired from above, and the professors
reverenc’d as sacred, and the favourites of heaven.

He adds, that we excel the ancients in musick, if not in poetry, and
prefers a good _English_ song, tho’ set to a common tune, before the
_Italian_ trifling unnatural compositions. The _one_ ravishes the ear
only, the _other_ entertains the understanding also.----Hence he takes
occasion to recommend _A collection of ~Lyric~ poems and songs with
musick annexed_, lately publish’d.


Free Briton, _Jan. 7._ No. 58.

The author refutes a falsity advanced by Mr _D’anvers_ in the
_Craftsman_ of the 13th of _Dec._ wherein, speaking of the riot-act,
he says, “That an election of Church-wardens hath been already made a
handle for putting this law in execution. That the master of a small
vessel was kept a whole year in prison, to the loss of his voyage,
and almost the ruin of his family, upon happening to go thro’ the
church-yard, from visiting a friend, an hour after the proclamation was
read. Nay, that the poor man might have run the hazard of his life, as
well as have been put to further expences, if his late Majesty had not
been graciously pleas’d to grant him a _Noli prosequi_.”

The falsehood of this story the _Free Briton_ thus corrects.--The
gentlemen of _Greenwich_ disagreeing upon the choice of a church-warden
at _Easter_ 1722, a poll was demanded and a scrutiny afterwards agreed
on. The scrutineers met, but a number of dissolute persons tumultuously
assembling at the same time, insulted the justices in a rude and
outragious manner, (justice _Savory_ receiving a blow on the back by
a great stone) so that it was thought proper to read the proclamation
in order to disperse them. Among the rioters was _Charles Curtis_,
master of a small vessel. He was with them before, at, and after the
proclamation was read, and very notorious by his behaviour; was several
times admonished by the justices to depart; and as often very civilly
acquainted by them with the ill consequence of his continuance in that
riotous assembly. But notwithstanding their repeated admonitions, he
still continued, and was found among the rioters an hour and a half
after the Proclamation was read, and being even then advised to leave
that place, and to avoid the fatal consequence, the said _Curtis_,
still refused to depart, and insisted with uncommon insolence, that
he was as much about his business in that place as the justices
themselves. Whereupon he was apprehended, committed to _Maidstone
Gaol_, try’d, and convicted, but in compassion to his family his
punishment was suspended; but a _Noli prosequi_ was never granted.

The aim of the _Free Briton_, in this paper, is to shew the
inconclusive reasoning of the _Craftsman_ from matters of fact
_falsely_ asserted.


Free Briton, _Jan. 14._ No. 59.

In the conclusion of this paper is a letter by way of reply to the
_Craftsman_, Jan. 9. wherein that author calls upon the _Free Briton_
to justify the administration for breaking with the Emperor. To which
the _Free Briton_ answers, that it will be full time to make a defence
when such measures are undertaken; that their insolence is astonishing,
in imputing the same crimes to our ministers for which themselves
have deserved a halter. Asks the _Craftsman_ whether he imagines the
ministry are so fond of the Emperor on the sudden, as to sacrifice the
trade of _Spain_, and abandon all the powers of _Europe_, only to run
into his arms?

In _Feb._ last an outcry was rais’d on a pretended discovery that the
ministry were making up at _Vienna_ by an implicit guarantee of the
Emperor’s succession to the _Austrian Netherlands_, as he should settle
it; yet this could not be obtain’d of the _British_ councils; and now
we are told we are ready to lurch all our allies for his sake.

The authors of the _Craftsman_ allow that this Treaty-breaking measure
would be right, provided a certain great man was removed. As if
national compacts could be dissolv’d by the change of the ministers:
The nation must answer for the faith of treaties. Grants that such a
conduct might be expected, should this ministry be chang’d.

It does not redound to the shame of those who made the treaty of
_Seville_, that the parties have allow’d the Emperor a reasonable
time to come into their measures; which if they had not, they would
have been charg’d with rashness, precipitation, and every enormity.
Concludes with mentioning several injuries and insults that this nation
has suffer’d from the Imperial quarter.


Free Briton, _Jan. 21._

He applies _Job_’s saying to his friends, _Will you lye for God?_ to
the Craftsman, _Will you lye for liberty and country?_ and asks, if he
demands impunity for defamatory falsehood?

Breach of faith, which the _Craftsman_ had laid to the charge of the
ministry, is the most virulent aspersion that a libeller can utter
against any government, is therefore punishable, and declares his
opinion, that spreading false news is no part of the freedom of the
press.

He thinks no honest cause wants the assistance of falshood, so no man
should lay claim to liberty who adheres not to truth; therefore the
_Craftsman_ ought not to complain of severity from the government,
unless he will evince the truth of his assertion.

Men think that prosecutions and confinement are very hard, not
considering the provocations that urg’d them; and that the worst
imputations are charg’d on the councils of the crown, without the least
colour of truth. The punishment inflicted on a libelling printer, bears
no proportion with the wrongs thus offer’d to a great people.

Distinguishes between _opinions_ offr’d upon national affairs, and
_misrepresentations_ of those affairs. The first is not criminal, the
other may. Says, these men may be punished on the Statute, as spreaders
of false news.

The _Craftsman_ can defend himself no other way then by refuting the
charge of falshood.

The _Craftsman_ had suggested that the _Government_ abetted the very
practices for which he is under prosecution; and instanced in the
pamphlet _Sedition and Defamation display’d_, which represents the
conduct and characters of two persons who have laboured these five
years to make this ministry odious, for which reasons the opposite
writers spare no invectives to point out these gentlemen _Weekly_,
as _Traitors_ and _Villains_. The _Free Briton_ here justifies the
characters complain’d of.


Free Briton, _Jan. 28._ No. 61.

He takes notice that the _Craftsman_ in his reply to the pamphlet
called _Sedition and Defamation display’d_, has not once attempted
to show that the characters of two gentlemen there given are in the
least unlike or injurious, and maintains that whatever is said of them
in that pamphlet is indisputably true; yet observes, that the author
admitted, that he who had _wronged_ his friendship, and _betrayed_
his confidence, came into the world with _all the advantages_ that
recommend men to the _esteem, favour, and approbation of mankind_.

The _Craftsman_ on the contrary divests the minister whose character he
draws of all those _talents_ and _abilities_, without which, _power_ is
not _easily acquir’d_, or _long maintain’d_. See p. 4.

But the _minister’s abilities_ have been the dread and disappointment
of his enemies, and have carried him thro’ innumerable difficulties
for five years together, and enabled him to baffle all their attempts
against him; notwithstanding he is describ’d as setting out in mean
circumstances, and recommended to mankind by every bad quality, yet
those who object this now, were more than ten years his associates in
_private life_ as well as _publick affairs_. As to what has been said
of his being _superior in impudence to all_, this author replies, that
’twas never heard that he call’d gentlemen _scoundrels_ in _publick
assemblies_; reviled the _Speeches_ from the _Throne_; or, that if
affairs were managed as he dictated, he would maintain his Majesty’s
administration.

Several other scurrilous reflections, thrown out against this
honourable person, are answer’d at large in this paper, and some of
them charged with notorious falshood.


The British Journal: or, The Traveller, _Jan. 9._

The author mentions two evils which attend those that trade with
pawnbrokers; the first is, persons who have left pledges in their
hands, upon offering to redeem them, have been obliged to advance five
or six shillings more than they borrow’d on them. The other is the
power of the pawnbroker to defraud his customer entirely of his pledge;
both which may be redress’d by obliging pawnbrokers to give a receipt
to every person borrowing money on pledges, to which both borrower and
lender shall subscribe their names, and each of them take a copy.

In some considerations on the stage, opera’s, and the force of musick,
he says, that an opera ought to be as regularly conducted, and the
characters as justly maintain’d; the same end propos’d, and as large
room for the exercise of a fine genius, as in tragedy or comedy. That a
compleat opera set to musick would have an advantage over tragedy. Is
not pleased with the _Recitativo_ of an opera, because ’tis the musick
of the songs only that dwell on the memory.

Distinguishes between the grand-opera and those ballad-opera’s now in
vogue, which latter, if well set to musick, might deserve applause.

Commends _Addison_’s _Rosamond_ as a beautifull piece of poetry, both
in fable and language. In it is maintain’d the dignity of tragedy,
the humour of comedy, and the principal end of opera’s; _i. e._ the
encouragement of virtue, discouraging vice, and probability through the
whole is preserv’d.


The British Journal, _Jan. 23._

Relates the history of two traytors, _Edric_ the father, and _Edric_
the son, who lived near 800 years ago; from which he collects and
concludes with this lesson to princes, that they ought to be cautious
whom they trust, and to pry with piercing eyes into the conduct of
their ministers, and the motives of their counsels.


_An Extract of a Discourse made to the ~Royal Society~, in Defence
of Mr. ~Cheselden~’s intended Operation on the Ear of a condemn’d
Malefactor._ Daily Courant. _Jan. 17._

The author first observes, that the skin, commonly call’d, _The Drum
of the Ear_, is not the organ of hearing, as was vulgarly thought;
for the proof of which he offers a great number of reasons and
observations of his own, as well as the opinions and reasons of the
most learned and judicious anatomists. He then observes, there are
two passages to the organs of hearing; one by the outward ear, the
other thro’ the back part of the mouth, thro’ which some people can
hear, who cannot hear thro’ the outward ear. In this case he supposes
the sound may be interrupted by the drum of the ear, which is seated
in this passage, and being diseased, may hinder sounds from passing
to the internal parts, where are seated the proper organs of hearing:
In this case only, he supposes, that perforating the drum may prove a
remedy for deafness, as depressing the chrystalline humour of the eye
(vulgarly call’d couching a cataract) is daily found to be a remedy for
blindness; and yet that operation has been as indecently and ignorantly
ridicul’d as the experiment of Mr. _Cheselden_’s; one writer against
that operation not scrupling to give his book the following title, _A
new method of recovering the sight by putting out the eye_. He also
deserves, that the scituation of the drum is such, that the operation
may be easily made by a skilful person; and it being a very thin skin,
he presumes it will not be very painful; and if so, the person who is
to undergo the experiment will purchase his life upon very easy terms:
But supposing it should be very painful; (which ’tis hop’d it will not
be) on whom can the first experiment be so fitly made, for the service
of mankind, as on one whose life is already forfeited to the publick?

[See page 10. Col. 2]


_Read’s Weekly Journal_, Jan. 16.

Entertains his readers with a letter from a correspondent concerning
the present state of the _Law_; takes notice of the spleen which in
general appears against lawyer and law; says, that the multiplicity
of statutes is one of the greatest grievances of this kingdom. Quotes
an opinion of a learned judge, that the best way to reform the law,
was to abrogate all the acts made for its amendment. Asserts, that the
founding a proper _Corpus Juris_, is the highest point of policy in
a well order’d state. The old _English_ method of proceeding against
debtors, being judg’d inconvenient, produced the act on which was
found’d the _Capias in detinue_, as the shortest way of recovery.
Complains of fictitious suits, particularly in ejectments. He resents
likewise the encouragement given in every court to the multitude
of suitors, as contrary to the very ends of justice. Proposes some
remedies for these evils, by an act empowering commissioners to inspect
into

1. _The condition of the law in general, common and statute; what of
them may be repealed, and what not._

2. _To frame proper instructions to direct those who are intrusted with
the execution of the law._

3. _To examine into the nature of actions on the case, which by judge
~Dodderidge~ is declared to be a feigned action contrived in deceit of
the law._

4. _To contrive how to prevent vexatious and litigious suits, by
lessening the credit of parole agreement._

5. _That every practiser of the law be obliged by oath to give his
opinion justly to the best of his knowledge, to practise fairly, and by
no indirect means procure false judgment in any case._

Lastly, _To compile a compleat body of the law, with an institute of
maxims and rules, a treatise of practice, and the forms to be observed
by courts._

_~ODE~ for New-Years-Day by ~C. Cibber~, Esq;_

    _Recitativo._

    Once more the ever circling Sun
    Thro’ the coelestial signs has run,
    Again old Time inverts his glass,
    And bids the annual Season pass:
    The youthful Spring shall call for birth,                   5
    And glad with op’ning flow’rs the Earth:
    Fair Summer lead with Sheaves the Field,
    And golden Fruit shall Autumn yield,
    Each to the Winter’s want their store shall bring,
    ’Till warmer genial Suns recall the Spring.                10

    _Air._

      Ye grateful _Britons_ bless the Year,
        That kindly yields increase,
      While plenty that might feed a War,
        Enjoys the guard of peace,
      Your plenty to the Skies you owe,                        15
        Peace is your Monarch’s care;
      Thus bounteous _Jove_ and _George_ below
        Divided empire share.

    _Recitativo._

    _Britannia_ pleas’d, looks round her realms to see
    Your various causes of Felicity!                           20
    (To glorious War, a glorious peace succeeds;
    For most we triumph when the Farmer feeds)
    Then truly are we great when truth supplies
    Our Blood, our Treasures drain’d by victories.
    Turn happy _Briton_, to the throne your Eyes,              25
      And in the royal offspring see,
    How amply bounteous providence supplies
      The source of your felicity.

    _Air._

    Behold in ev’ry Face imperial Graces shine
    All native to the Race of _George_ and _Caroline_:         30
    In each young Hero we admire
    The blooming virtue of his sire;
    In each maturing fair we find,
    Maternal charms of softer kind.

    _Recitativo._

    In vain thro’ ages past has _Phœbus_ reli’d,               35
    E’re such a sight blest _Albion_ could behold
    Thrice happy Mortals, if your state you knew,
    Where can the Globe so blest a nation shew?
    All that of you indulgent Heav’n requires,
    Is loyal Hearts, to reach your own Desires.                40
    Let Faction then her self born views lay down,
    And Hearts united, thus address the Throne.

      Hail! Royal _Cesar_, hail!
        Like this may ev’ry annual Sun
        Add brighter Glories to thy Crown,                     45
      ’Till Suns themselves shall fail.

    _Recitativo._

    May Heav’n thy peaceful Reign prolong,
    Nor let to thy great Empires wrong,
    Foreign or native Foes prevail.
      _Hail_, &c.

_~ODE~ humbly inscribed to the Poet Laureat, taken from ~Lon. Evening
Post~ Jan. 7. as there said by ~Step. Duck~, Esq._

_Semei in annoridet Apollo._

    _Recitativo._

    Accept, O _Cibber_, the advent’rous lay,
    Which, to your honour, dares both sing and say:
    To you great Prince of Comedy and Song,
    The Tributes o’ inferior Pens belong;
    You, who by royal favour wear the Bays,
    And grateful eternize our Monarch’s Praise.

    _Air._

      Let us sing to the King,
    All about the circling Year;
      Sing a _floreat_ to the _laureat_,
    Ev’ry Season brings good cheer,
    Grateful _Britons_, thank the bard,
    Who by Peace does plenty guard,
    Such as hungry War does need,
    War, that does on plenty feed.

    _Recitativo._

    Phœbus with joy looks _Britain_ round to see,
    The happy state of his lov’d Poetry,
    To _Eusdes_, _Cibber_ gloriously succeeds;
    Wit triumphs most, when bard like farmer feeds!
    Then truly are we great, when he can shew
    The way _his own out-doings to out-do_.
    Cast, envious Poets, on his Verse your Eyes,
      Behold the offspring of his brain.
    How his rich Genius constantly supplies
      The source of his poetick vein!

    _Air._

    Thro’out the whole what matchless Graces shine;
    _Paraphonalia_ sparkles in each Line;
      Native to _Cibber_, we admire
      The style and fancy, wit and fire,
      In each maturing Word we find
      Something soft for thought design’d.

    _Recitativo._

    Complain not Sol, of fruitless ages past,
    Think your self blest in such a Son at last!
    Thrice happy Poets, if you knew your state;
    _Britain_ alone can boast a _Laureat_.
    For if, like him, to Grandeur you aspire,
    By his Example reach your own desire.
    Let criticks then their self born views lay down;
    And Bards in chorus thus sing round the town.

    _Air._

      Hail! Matchless _Colley_, hail!
    Like this may ev’ry New Year’s Day
    Add fresher Honour to the Bay,
      ’Till Bay itself shall fail.

    _Recitativo._

    May Heaven preserve thy Genius clear,
    For _Christmas_ comes but once a Year.
      Give the Poet then some Ale.
        _Ale_, &c.


From _Fog_’s Journal, _Jan. 9._

An Ode on _Twelfth Day_. In Imitation of an Ode on _New Year’s-Day_.

_Past Two o’Clock, and a frosty Morning._

    _Recitativo._

    Once more the Bell-man bids us wake,
      With Prophesy of Ale and Cake;
      Tells us before we sleep again,
      _Tom_ shall be King, and _Nancy_ Queen,
      While good Sir Knight a Knave appears,
      And Madam the Slut’s Ensign wears.
      Such Kings and Queens should _Colly_ sing,
      Such Worthies in his numbers ring;
    While both the _British_ soil and Foreign Shores,
    To form the Cake, unite their grateful Stores.

    _Air._

    Ye grateful Footmen, bless the Day,
      That such Preferments give;
    Ye joyful Cook-maids drink away,
      While ye your Title lives.
    Good Ale you to the Brewer owe,
      The Cake’s the Baker’s care,
    And all above, and eke below,
      Combine to give good fare.

    _Recitativo._

    _Tom_ thinks himself a real Monarch grown,
    And, pleas’d looks round the Kitchen as his own.
    While _Nancy_ with him royal Honour shares,
    And on the other Maids majestick stares.
    The New King’s Health is first, the Queen’s succeed:
    And most he triumphs, who most freely feeds.
    Then all are truly great when Ale supplies
    The want of Riches and of Dignities,
    And the exhausted Jugg gives victories.
    Turn happy _Will_, _Jack_, _Kate_, and _Doll_, your eyes
      On yon Two Chairs, and there observe
    How well the new rais’d prince the place supplies
      Which both, as you must own, deserve.

    _Air._

    Behold in each pleas’d face what lovely graces shine,
    How on their little realm they look with air benign,
      Such, _Will_, must you and _Kate_ appear,
      If Fortune the ensuing Year,
      Convinces us she is not blind,
      By proving to your merit kind.

    _Recitativo._

    In vain above Three Hundred Days have pass’d
    Between this joyful Twelfth Day and the last,
    No Scene like this has chear’d your Hearts and Eyes,
    Where shall we find such bliss beneath the Skies?
    All that Sir _William_ and my Lady ask,
    Is, that when all have well perform’d their Task,
    With silent pace, without your Shoes you’ll tread
    And each go peaceably, tho’ drunk to bed.

    _Air._

      Hail! merry Monarch, hail!
    Like this may ev’ry annual Cake
    You merrier still and merrier make,
      ’Till Cakes themselves shall fail.

    _Recitativo._

    May you all long your Places keep;
    May no makebate amongst you creep,
      With Peace destroying Tale.


A HYMN to the LAUREAT, Introduced in the _Whitehall_ and _London_
Evening Posts, _Jan. 9._ thus

Sir, _By giving a Place in your Paper to the following Unfashionable
Hymn you will very much oblige Sir_,

                                                _your Humble servt._

    _Cibber_, accept these feeble lays
      From an unskilfull muse,
    Who tries with artless Note, to praise
      What _envious men_ abuse.

    Nature and Art in thee combine;
      Thy Comedies excell:
    With Wit and Sense replete, they shine,
      And read politely well.

    Who sees th’ inconstant[1] _Loveless_ range,
      But mourns _Amanda’s_ fate?
    Each female Heart approves his change,
      And pants for such a state.

    When Lady _Betty_[2] treads the stage,
      All _modish_ prudes submit:
    What _Foppington_ adorns our age,
      With the same Grace and Wit?

    In _Townley_[3] see the _modern Wife_!
      How full of Vice! how blam’d!
    How ruin’d by the _modern Life_!
      How valu’d, when reclaim’d!

    May empty Journals weekly rail;
      May all dull bards repine:
    If Wit unequall’d shou’d prevail,
      The _Laurel’s_ justly thine.

To the Author of the _Whitehall Evening Post_.

_Jan. 12._

SIR,

As you are an impartial Writer, I dare say you will do justice on both
sides.

The Verses on the _Laureat_, in yours of _Saturday_ last, have
occasion’d the following reply; which I hope you will give a Place
to in your next, to show that we can be quick as well as smart, upon
a proper occasion. And as I think it the lowest mark of a scoundrel
to make bold with any man’s character in print, without subscribing
the true name of the author; I therefore desire, if the _Laureat_ is
concern’d enough to ask the question, that you will tell him my name,
and where I live, till then I beg leave to be known by no other than
that of your servant,

                                                 _Francis Fair-play_.

    _Ah! hah! Sir ~Coll.~ is that thy way,_
      _Thy own dull Praise to write?_
    _And would’st thou stand so sure a lay?_
      _No! that’s too stale a bite._

    _Nature and art in thee combine,_
      _Thy Talents here excell:_
    _All shining brass thou dost outshine,_
      _To play the cheat so well._

    _Who sees thee in ~Iago~’s part,_
      _But thinks thee such a Rogue?_
    _And is not glad with all his heart,_
      _To hang so sad a Dog?_

    _When ~Bays~ thou play’st, thy self thou art,_
      _For that by nature fit,_
    _No blockhead better suits the part,_
      _Than such a coxcomb wit,_

    _In ~Wronghead~ too, thy brains we see,_
      _Who might do well at plough;_
    _As fit for Parliament was he,_
      _As for the Laurel thou._

    _Bring thy protected verse from Court,_
      _And try it on the Stage;_
    _There it will make much better sport,_
      _And set the town in rage._

    _There beau’s, & wits, & cits, and smarts,_
      _Where hissing’s not uncivil,_
    _Will shew their parts to thy deserts,_
      _And send it to the devil._

    _But, ah! in vain ’gainst thee we write,_
      _In vain thy verse we maul;_
    _Our sharpest satyr’s thy delight,_
      _For [4]~Blood!~ thou’lt stand it all_!

    _Thunder, ’tis said, the Laurel spares,_
      _Nought but thy brow could blast it,_
    _And yet! O curst provoking Stars!_
      _Thy comfort is, thou ~hast~ it._

[4] Epilogue to the _Non-juror_.


An ODE to Sir _Robert Walpole_, for New-Year’s-Day, 1731.

    I.

    Guardian of _Britannia’s_ glory,
      Life and soul of _Europe’s_ peace,
    Greatest name in modern story,
      May thy happy years increase!
    Brighter still thy genius shining,
    Richer blessings yet designing.

    II.

    Thee, the sacred muses hailing,
      Dulness seal’d in slumber lies;
    Arts and wealth thro’ thee prevailing,

_An Epitaph on Mrs. OLDFIELD._

                         Hic Juxta requiescit,
                  Tot inter poetarum laudata nomina,
                            ANNA OLDFIELD.
                     Nec ipsa minore laude digna,
                        Quippe quæ eorum opera
                      In scenam quories prodivit,
                  Illustravit semper, & nobilitavit.
             Nunquam ingenium idem ad partes diversissimas
                            Habilius fuit.
                       Ita tamen ut ad singulas.
                  Non facta, sed nata esse videretur.
                             In tragediis
           Formæ splendor, oris dignitas, incessus majestas
                 Tantâ vocis suavitate temperabantur,
           Ut nemo esset tam agrestis, tam durus spectator,
                 Quin in admirationem totus raperetur.
                           In comedià autem
        Tanta vis, tam venusta hilaritas, tam curiosa felicitas
                 Ut neque sufficerent spectando oculi,
                        Neque plaudendo manus.

English’d thus.

_Near this place rests the body of ~Anne Oldfield~, amidst so many
celebrated Poets, herself not less deserving to be celebrated; for
whene’er she trod the stage, her actions always illustrated and
ennobled their compositions. Never was one Genius so adapted to the
most different parts; she seem’d not made but born for each distinctly.
In tragedy her noble presence, elevated speech, and majestic step,
temper’d with so peculiar a sweetness of voice, never fail’d to
transport the most rustic and insensible into admiration. In comedy she
discover’d such a winning air, such a sprightly and becoming gayety,
and so happy an address, that neither eyes were satisfied with seeing
her, nor hands weary of applauding._


_Another._

    Fashion’d alike by nature and by art,
    To please, engage, and int’rest ev’ry heart:
    In publick life, by all who saw, approv’d;
    In private life, by all who knew her lov’d.


_Another._

      OLDFIELD lies here retir’d, undrest,
    The curtain drawn, her part is done;
      Ye that remain to act your best,
    Must also make your exit soon;
      How happy then, if worthy praise,
      Ye can such lasting plaudits raise!


_Another._

        EXIT
      Anna Oldfield;
    Valete & plaudite.


_Another._

      Hic jacet _Anna Oldfield_.
        Jam mea preacta est,
    Mox vestra agetur fabula.
      Vos valete & plaudite.


_Mrs. ~B--rb--r~, to Mrs. ~C--f--r~, at Bath._

    When lately you invited me,
        With _Carteret_ I din’d;
    And in return, most gen’rously
        To _Onslow_ I resign’d.

    On Opportunity we seize,
      For search the Nation round,
    Such _Commoners_ and _Peers_ as these
        Are rarely to be found.

    Our Situation chang’d, you see
        How pleasure fleets away;
    But yesterday you envy’d me;
        I envy you to day.


_EPIGRAM on a LADY, stung by a BEE._

    To heal the wound the Bee had made
      upon my _Delia’s_ face,
    Its honey to the wound she laid,
      and bid me kiss the place.

    Pleas’d I obey’d, and from the wound
      suck’d both the sweet and smart;
    The honey on my lips I found,
      the sting went thro’ my heart.

_Domestick Occurences in ~JANUARY, 1731~._


Melancholy Effects of Credulity in Witchcraft.

For _Burlington_ in _Pensilvania_ we have an account, that the owners
of several Cattle believing them to be bewitch’d, caused some suspected
men and women to be taken up, and trials to be made for detecting them.
Above 300 people assembled near the governor’s house, and a pair of
scales being erected, the suspected persons were each weigh’d against
a large Bible; but all of them vastly outweighing it, the accused
were then to be tied head and feet together, and put into a river, on
supposition that if they swam they must be guilty. This trial they
offer’d to undergo, in case as many of their accusers should be served
in the like manner; which being done, they all swam very buoyant,
to the no small diversion of the spectators, and clearing of the
accused.--This has revived a like transaction in _Somersetshire_ in
_Sept._ last, and another in _France_.

The first is from _Frome_ publish’d in the _Daily Journal_, _Jan. 15._
relating, That a child of one _Wheeler_ being seized with strange
unaccountable fits, the mother goes to a _Cunning Man_, who advis’d
her to hang a bottle of the child’s water, mix’d with some of it’s
hair, close stopt over the fire, that the witch would thereupon come
and break it: Does not mention the success, but a poor old woman, in
the neighbourhood, was taken up, and the old trial by _Water Ordeal_
reviv’d. They dragg’d her, shivering with an ague, out of her house,
set her astride on the pomel of a saddle, and carried her about two
miles to a mill-pond, stript off her upper cloaths, tied her legs, and
with a rope about her middle threw her in, 200 spectators huzza-ing
and abetting the riot. They affirm she swam like a cork, tho’ forced
several times under water; and no wonder, for when they strained the
line, the ends whereof were held on each side of the pond, she must
of necessity rise; but by haling her from one bank to t’other, and
often plunging, she drank water enough, and when almost spent, they
poured in brandy to revive her, they drew her to a stable, threw her
on some litter in her wet cloaths, where in about an hour after she
expired. The coroner upon his Inquest cou’d make no discovery of the
ring-leaders, altho’ above 40 Persons assisted in the Fact, yet none of
them could be persuaded to accuse his Neighbour: so that they were able
to charge only 3 of them with Man-slaughter.

The like Credulity in witchcraft occasion’d a tragical Accident at a
Village near _Mortagne_ in _France_, in _December_ last. A Man of that
Village had been long ill of a Distemper which puzzled the Physicians;
whereupon his Wife believ’d he was bewitch’d, and consulted a pretended
Conjurer, who shew’d her the Wizard (her husband’s uncle) in a glass
of Water, and told her, that to oblige him to withdraw the Charm,
they must beat him, and burn the Soles of his Feet. On her Return she
sent for the Uncle, and notwithstanding his Protestations, with the
Assistance of her Relations, beat him unmercifully, and burnt the Soles
of his Feet, and the Crown of his Head in such a manner, that in two
Days after he died. The Woman and her Accomplices were seized; she
own’d the Fact, and said, if it was to do again, she would do it. _See_
p. 358.


Extraordinary Accidents, and Casualties.

A barbarous Murder was committed the 4th Inst. at Night, on _John
Williams_ Carpenter of _Cumback_ in _Radnorshire_, by stabbing him in
the Throat with a Knife, and beating out his Brains with an Ax: His
Door being left latch’d, and the Key in the thatch as usual, and no
Robbery committed. It was not discover’d till the 7th, when his only
Brother _William_ came, and in the presence of abundance of Neighbours,
owned the bloody Knife, which together with the washing of his bloody
Cloaths by his sweetheart the Night the Murder was committed, and
no body to get by his Brother’s death but himself, caus’d him to be
apprehended, and sent to _Presteign_ Goal; and his Sweetheart was bound
to appear against him. _See_ p. 178.

From _Dijon_ in France, ’tis written, that a Person having withdrawn
himself, his Relations charg’d one who was his sworn Enemy with his
murder, and examin’d him with such exquisite tortures, that, to shorten
them he confess’d the crime: whereupon he was broke alive, and two
others as his accomplices were hanged. The Man suppos’d to be murder’d,
soon after return’d home.

_Brussels 25._ O. S. About 2 o’Clock this morning, a dreadful fire
broke out in the Arch Dutchess’s palace, which with the goods and
furniture, and Royal Chapel were laid in ashes in less than 12 hours.
The Arch-Dutchess and her ladies only escap’d, almost all the Papers
and Records of State being consum’d.

_Bourdeaux, Jan. 24._ N. S. Forty monks dy’d here in one Night; upon
enquiry to discover the cause, a dead Viper was found in a Cask of
Wine they had regal’d themselves with, suppos’d to have come in at the
bung-hole.

_Morlaix_, in lower _Bretagne_, _Jan. 11._ N. S. By a fire which broke
out in the hospital, the whole town was burnt down; the People were
reduc’d to the greatest hardships.

Several nuns have dy’d suddenly at _Englen_, five leagues from
_Brussels_, their Bodies were open’d, but no marks of Contagion or
Poison appearing, some weak People believed it must be by witchcraft,
but they could not tell whom to accuse. However, the surviving sisters
quitted the Cloysters, and with the Bp.’s consent return’d to their
Friends.


_The following Narrative, given by a Gentleman of unexceptionable
Honour and Veracity, has been lately published at ~Edinburgh~._

One _William Sutor_, Aged about 37, a farmer in _Middle-mause_
(belonging to the Laird of _Balgown_ near _Craighal_,) being about
the month of _December_, 1728, in the fields with his servants, near
his own house, over-heard at some distance, as it were, an uncommon
skreeking and noise; and they following the Voice, fancied they saw a
dark gray-colour’d Dog; but as it was dark night, they concluded it was
a Fox, and accordingly were for setting on their Dogs: but it was very
observeable, that not one of them would so much as point his Head that
way.

About a month after, the said _Sutor_ being occasionally in the same
spot, and much about the same time of Night, it appear’d to him again,
and in passing, touched him so smartly on the Thigh, that he felt a
pain all that Night.

In _December_ 1729, it again cast up to him at about the same place,
and past him at some distance.

In _June_ 1730, it appeared to him as formerly: And it was now he began
to judge it was something extraordinary.

On the last _Monday_ of _Nov._ 1730, about sky-setting, as he was
coming from _Drumlochy_, this officious visiter passed him as formerly,
and in passing, he distinctly heard it speak these words, _Within eight
or ten days do or die_; and instantly disappear’d, leaving him not a
little perplex’d.

Next morning he came to his brother _James_’s house, and gave him a
particular account of all that had happen’d: And that night, about 10
of the clock, these two brothers having been visiting their sister at
_Glanballow_, and returning home, stept aside to see the remarkable
spot, where they had no sooner arriv’d, then it appear’d to _William_,
who pointing his finger to it, desired his brother and a servant who
was with them, to look to it; but neither of them could see any such
thing.

Next _Saturday_ evening, as _William_ was at his sheep-fold, it came
up to him, and audibly utter’d these Words _Come to the spot of ground
within, half an hour_. Whereupon he went home, and taking a Sword and
a staff in his hand, came to the ground, being at last determined
to see the Issue. He had scarce encircled himself with a line of
circumvallarion, when his troublesome familiar came up to him, he ask’d
it, _In the name of God, who are you?_ It answer’d, _I am David Sutor,
George Sutor’s Brother: I killed a Man, more than 35 years ago, at a
bush by East the road as you go into the Isle_. He said to it, _David
Sutor was a Man, and you appear as a Dog_. It answer’d, _I killed him
with a Dog, and am made to speak out of the mouth of a Dog: and I tell
you to go bury these Bones_.

This coming to the ears of the _Minister_ of _Blair_, the Lairds of
_Glascloon_ and _Rychalzie_, &c. about 40 Men, went together to the
said Isle; but after opening ground in several places, found no Bones.

On the 23d of _Decemb._ about midnight, when _William_ was in bed, it
came to his door, and said, _Come away: you will find the bones at the
side of the wither’d Bush, and there are but 8 left_; and told him at
the same time for a sign, that he would find the print of a Cross
impress’d on the Ground.

Next day _William_ and his brother, with about 40 or 50 people who had
conveen’d out of curiosity, came to the place, where they discover’d
the bush, and the cross by it; and upon digging the ground about a
foot down found the eight bones: All which they immediately wrapt in
clean linen, and being put in a coffin with a mort-cloth over it, were
interr’d that evening in the church-yard of _Blair_, attended by about
100 Persons.

N. B. _Several People in that Country remember to have seen this ~David
Sutor~; and that he listed for a Soldier, and went abroad about 34 or
35 years ago._

Remarkable _ADVERTISEMENTS_.

In the _Gazette_, _Jan. 30._ ’tis advertis’d, that in _July 1729_, at
_Bentworth_ in the County of _Southampton_, a barn was set on fire, and
the corn and grain therein, the Stables and out houses adjoining were
entirely burnt. Several messuages in the said parish have since been
confirmed in the same manner, and _Bentworth_, it self threatned to be
laid in ashes; his Majesty’s pardon is promised to any one that would
discover his Accomplice.

In the _Gazette_ of the same date, ’tis advertis’d, that the widows
of such half-pay Officers as serv’d, and to whom they were marry’d in
the year 1716, may receive their proportions of the sum of 1500 _l._
granted the last Sessions of Parliament for that purpose.

_London Evening Post_, _Jan. 28th._ ’tis advertis’d from _Whitehaven_,
that a vessel sailed for _London_, laden with the late Mr. _Wood_’s
ore, coals, cinders, and lime-stone, to be carried to _Chelsea_, to
give a Specimen that iron is to be made from the ore and pit-coal. A
reason is demanded why _Chelsea_, that produces neither, is a better
place to make iron, than the neighbourhood of _Whitehaven_, where there
is plenty of both, unless there was design of imposing upon the World?

Any poor person may be cured of the _Ague_ gratis, by a dose only,
which may be contained in a gill-glass, and never known to fail.
To be had of Mr. _Sam. Tripland_, at the _Coach-maker’s Arms_ in
_Great-windmill-street_, over-against the _Hay-market_.

Letters patent were granted to Mr. _G. Kettle_ of _Southwark_, for
making and dying of hats and ruffs of different colours, except black.

_Foreign Affairs._


We think it a proper introduction to the history of the year newly
begun, to give our readers a transient view of the situation of Affairs
at the conclusion of the last; and as we find this ready done to our
hands in the _Post-Boy_, _Dec. 31._ we shall make no apology for
epitomizing his essay upon that Subject.

The Clouds in which the fate of _Europe_ was obscur’d at the close of
the Year 1729, are not yet dissipated, notwithstanding the efforts of
politicians, the number of Negotiations, and the union of four of the
most formidable powers in _Europe_, by the Treaty of _Seville_.

The allies of _Seville_ now see in what advantageous situation the
treaty of _Utrecht_ has put the Emperor in _Italy_. We find, that the
Empire, which in the reign of _Leopold_, could not send 20,000 men
to the _Rhine_ or _Flanders_, without subsidies from _England_ or
_Holland_, can send 20,000 men to _Italy_, and maintain them there
without assistance, its revenue amounting to no less than 15 millions
of _Florins_ a year. She now employs her Powers to baffle the projects
of those who rais’d her to this grandeur: Projects whose only drift is
the Execution of a treaty, wherein the Imperial court is one of the
principal parties contracting, which treaty was made with two views.
The first was an addition to the power of the Emperor in _Italy_, by
bringing under her obedience the two _Sicilies_. The second chear’d up
_Spain_ for the losses she had sustain’d, particularly in the fine
branches lopt from that crown, by securing to one of her _Infantes_ the
uncertain hope of two successions.

The catholick King and his allies do not undertake or ask anything that
the Imperial court has just reason to complain of.

The reasons alledg’d by the Imperialists for their complaints are, that
an alteration had been made in one single article of the quadruple
alliance, which set forth the _manner_ of securing to the _Infante_ of
_Spain_ the eventual succession which had been promis’d him. But,

1. This alteration is of no great importance, because the 6000
_neutral_ troops which by the treaty of _London_ were to be garrison’d
in _Tuscany_ and _Parma_, by the treaty of _Seville_ are only turn’d
into _Spaniards_, which are in some sort made neutral by being
discharg’d from the oath to their sovereign, and made to take an oath
to the Great Duke, and Duke of _Parma_.

2. This alteration does not prejudice to the Emperor, or threaten
him with any hereafter, because his strict and religious observation
of treaties will not suffer him to oppose the _Infante_’s promis’d
succession; nor will the _bona fide_ of the king of _Spain_ let him
employ his 6000 _Spaniards_ on any design but what is stipulated by the
treaty of _Seville_.

3. This alteration was not made without substantial reasons. The
Imperialists always opposed the motion for putting _Spaniards_ in
garrison in the towns of _Tuscany_ and _Parma_; and were averse even to
the admission of neutral troops; upon which the allies passed the 4th
article of the treaty of _Seville_.

This article was the subject of the late Negotiations. The resolution
of the Imperial court to admit of no deviation from the treaty
of Quadruple alliance; and that of the court of _Spain_ never to
consent to any alteration in the treaty of _Seville_, occasion’d the
preparations for war all the last summer, but ended in preparations
offensive and defensive, and were kept from breaking into action by the
thread of negotiation; and the opening of this scene is reserved for
the year we are now entering upon; _but hitherto Things remain in the
same situation_, Jan. 30.

_Constantinople._ Since the great revolution made here by the
Janizaries in cutting to pieces the late Vizier, _Capigi Aga_, Capt.
_Bashaw_, and _Mufti_, &c., and afterwards deposing Sultan _Achmet_,
and raising the new Sultan (whose father was depos’d in 1703) to the
throne; there has been no settled government. For upon divers pretences
these tumultuous rebels were frequently up in arms, demanding several
new regulations; particularly the promoting of their favourites, and
the removal or death of those who were obnoxious to ’em. All which
was comply’d with in order to appease them: But this procedure not
satisfying them, and they still continuing mutinous, the Grand Segnior
under pretence of holding a general council, got the chief of ’em into
his palace, cut ’em all off with their servants; and about 7000 of
their followers were strangled, to the great joy of this city; these
rebellious people grew so insolent, as to tax families what sums they
pleas’d, and even to plunder in the street: But now every thing is
reduc’d to the old _Ottoman_ rules of government.

_Moscow, Jan. 8._ Advices from Derbent say, that the princes of Georgia
passed that place, in their way home much pleased with the honours they
have received from this court, and that one of them, who lives near
mount Arrarat, had promis’d to send the Empress a relique of _Noah’s
Ark_.

_Venice._ ’Tis currently reported that this republick will equip a
squadron of twenty Ships of war, to put to sea early next spring, to
watch the motions of the Turks.

_Vienna, Jan. 20._ Our hopes of an accommodation with _Spain_ encrease
daily.

_Paris._ New proposals of accommodation are negotiating with _Spain_
and the Emperor; and ’tis thought with a fair prospect of success.

_Swisserland, Bern._ Provision is making in all the protestant cantons
for the reception of a great number of Waldenses, who are depriv’d of
their liberties and drove from their habitations, by their sovereign
the duke of _Savoy_.

_Vienna._ There are privately handed about here copies of the
_Ultimatum_ (or last proposals) of the allies of _Seville_, as
transmitted hither from _Paris_; the substance of which is as follows.

1. _They would stipulate by a secret article not to oppose the
settlement of Succession which the ~Emperor~ might make for his
Territories in ~Italy~, and which should be freely accepted by the
States thereof; and they would engage to guaranty that Settlement._

2. _They would stipulate by a secret article, that they would not
oppose the advantages of Succession, which the ~Emperor~, with the
consent of the different States of ~Italy~, might procure in favour of
the archdutchess his daughter; and contribute to maintain what he shall
so establish for his daughters, or for any one he shall pitch upon,
with regard to his Territories in ~Italy~; and even to guaranty what
may be established by the ~Emperor~ in consequence of that Settlement._

_Seville, Jan. 16._ Couriers are continually arriving upon the heels of
one another, which occasion frequent councils.

_Hague._ About the latter end of this month their High Mightinesses
wrote a letter to the United Provinces, for the celebration of the 28th
of _Feb._ as a day of solemn thanksgiving, fasting and prayer, which
imports in substance, _That altho’ it has pleas’d God, in his infinite
patience and clemency, that we have enjoy’d peace last year, this peace
was nevertheless attended with so much uneasiness and difficulty, in
relation to the small success of the negotiations set on foot for
terminating amicably the differences in ~Europe~, and establishing
a general tranquillity, that we are still in a very uncertain and
difficult scituation, and have great reason to fear that a war may
at last happen, wherein this State may be engag’d, contrary to its
inclination: That our apprehension in this respect increases so much
the more when we consider, that notwithstanding all the blessings which
it hath pleased God to shower down upon our dear Country, the sins
and iniquities thereof, far from diminishing, increase daily, to such
a degree, that last year horrible, abominable sins appear’d, almost
unknown before in this Country; and that we ought to fear, that the
patience of the Lord, justly provok’d, ceasing, his Judgments may at
last fall upon our dear Country, unless we endeavour to prevent them,
by an unfeigned repentance and conversion._

_Observations in GARDENING for the Month of ~February~._


This is a month of great work for the gardener.

In the kitchen-garden renew the heat of your hot-beds with fresh dung,
and continue to sow cucumbers and melons as in the former month.

Make a large hot-bed for forward rhadishes and spring carrots; they may
be sown together, because the rhadishes be drawn in _March_, whereby
they will make room for the carrots. The bed must be cover’d with earth
7 or 8 inches thick, and defended with mats, supported with hoops.

Make a hot-bed for _Battersey_ kidney-beans, and all sorts of annuals,
except _African_ and _French_ marigold, which may be deferr’d 10 or
20 days. About the middle of the month, upon a declining hot-bed sow
colly-flower seeds; also in the natural ground pease, beans, parsley,
spinach, carrots, parsnips, turnips, onions, leeks, _Dutch_ brown
lettuce, and asparagus-seeds.

Sow skerrits in light rich ground, where they may have moisture.

Plant garlick, shalots, and rockambole, for increase, in light ground.

Transplant young cabbage-plants for a crop.

Make plantations of straw-berries, rasberries, goose-berries, currants,
and roses.

Elm-setts should now be gather’d from the roots of large trees, and
planted in nursery-beds, and young plantations should be now provided
with all sorts of forest-trees and shrubs, which are propagated from
slips or layers.

Set acorns of the _Ilex_, cork-tree, _English_ oak, chestnuts, and
walnuts.

Sow the sameria of the elm, and bay berries, all which come up the
first year.

Lay branches of several trees to take root. This is the best time to
raise any thing that will grow of slips.

Prune fruit-trees and vines; for now is your season to bind, plash,
nail, and dress, without danger of frosts. This is to be understood of
the most tender and delicate wall-fruits not finish’d before: do this
before the buds and bearers grow turgid; and yet in the nectarine and
like delicate mural fruit, the later the better, notwithstanding what
has been, and still is the contrary custom.

The latter end of this month is most proper to graft pears and plums of
all sorts; and some likewise graft apples and cherries in the cleft,
tho’ others defer apples longer. The cyons cut off from the trees last
month, are now to be used, without having any regard to the notion of
the age of the moon.

Now, as well as in _October_, may be planted the espaliers of pears,
plums, or apples, so useful as well as profitable in a garden; for
being planted a convenient distance from a fruit wall, they are an
admirable defence against blighting winds, and produce noble fruit.

Rub moss from trees after a shower of rain; scrape and cleanse them
from cankers, _&c._ Cut and lay quick-sets, and trim up palasade hedges.

Earth up the roots of uncover’d fruit-trees, and drain superfluous
moisture from roots of trees. Lay bird-lime for the bird called the
tit, or tit-mouse, which is a destructive enemy to dwarf pears and
plums in this and the preceding month, by destroying the buds.

The beginning of this month you may sow auricula seeds in cases fill’d
with light earth, and the seeds of the polyanthois in some shady border.

Transplant all sorts of flowering shrubs, which bear the weather; as
roses, jessamine, hony-suckle, laburnum, lelac, syringa, spipeas,
altheas, _&c._ You may make layers of roses, pomegranates, phillyrea,
laurus-tinus, and other shrubs.

Cut the _Spanish_ jessamine within 4 inches of the stem, giving them
fresh earth, likewise give fresh earth to your carnations planted
out in _Autumn_. Towards the latter end sow lark-spurs, hollyhocks,
_Canterbury_ bells, primrose-tree, sweet-williams, annual stocks,
candy-tufts, pinks, _&c._

Make plantations of the lilly of the valley on the side of some shady
bank. Sow orange and lemon kernels in pots; set the pots in hot-beds;
the kernels are to be used as soon as taken out of the fruit. Shift
such myrtles as require large pots, at the same time shaving off the
outside fibres of their root, and if there be occasion, prune their

ADVERTISEMENT.

_It has been unexceptionably advanced, that a good ~Abridgment~ of
the Law is more intelligible than the Statutes at large; so a nice
~Model~ is as entertaining as the ~Original~, and a true ~Specimen~
as satisfactory as the whole ~Parcel~: This may serve to illustrate
the Reasonableness of our present Undertaking, which in the ~first~
place is to give Monthly a View of all the Pieces of Wit, ~Humour~, or
Intelligence, daily offer’d to the Publick in the News-Papers, (which
of late are so multiply’d, as to render it impossible, unless a man
makes it a business, to consult them all) and in the ~next~ place we
shall join therewith some other matters of Use or Amusement that will
be communicated to us._

_Upon calculating the Number of News-Papers, ’tis found that (besides
divers written Accounts) no less than 200 Half-sheets per Month are
thrown from the Press only in ~London~, and about as many printed
elsewhere in the Three Kingdoms; a considerable Part of which
constantly exhibit Essays on various Subjects for Entertainment;
and all the rest, occasionally oblige their Readers with matters of
Public Concern, communicated to the World by Persons of Capacity thro’
their Means: so that they are become the chief Channels of Amusement
and Intelligence. But then being only loose Papers, uncertainly
scatter’d about, it often happens, that many things deserving
Attention, contained in them, are only seen by Accident, and others
not sufficiently publish’d or preserved for universal Benefit and
Information._

_This Consideration has induced several Gentlemen to promote a
Monthly Collection, to treasure up, as in a ~Magazine~, the most
remarkable Pieces on the Subjects abovemention’d, or at least impartial
Abridgments thereof, as a Method much better calculated to preserve
those Things that are curious, than that of transcribing._

_In pursuance whereof, and the great Encouragement already given, this
~WORK~ will be regularly continued, shall appear earlier, and contain
more than any other Monthly Book of the same Price._

_As all possible Care will be taken to avoid the Mistakes incident to
undertakings of this kind, so the Author will think himself oblig’d
to such Persons who shall give him a true state of any Transaction
erroneously publish’d in the Papers, or shall please to communicate any
Pieces of Wit or Entertainment proper to be inserted; directing for him
at the Printer’s at St. ~John~’s Gate, near ~Hicks’s-Hall~, where any
Persons sending proper Orders, may have the Numbers sent them, at their
first coming out, without further Trouble, whether in Town or Country._

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in

redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project

        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
