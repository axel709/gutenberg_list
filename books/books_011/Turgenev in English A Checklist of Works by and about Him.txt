Preface


This checklist was originally intended as a tribute to the memory of
Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev (1818–1883) on the seventy-fifth anniversary
of his death. The first section takes account of all works by Turgenev
published in English translation, including collected editions,
selections, and individually published works. The collected editions
are arranged chronologically while the selections and individually
published works are arranged alphabetically by English title. A second
section lists stories, prose poems, and other works of Turgenev which
were published in anthologies and periodicals. These are arranged
alphabetically by the titles under which they were published, with
individual stories and prose poems from _A Sportsman’s Notebook_
and _Poems in Prose_ being brought together under those titles.
The checklist concludes with a large section dealing with Turgenev
criticism in English, arranged chronologically.

Encyclopedia entries, brief notes, theatrical notices, adaptations from
Turgenev, and other trivia have as a rule not been included. No special
effort has been made to locate book reviews published after 1904, when
publication of the Hapgood translation of the collected works was
completed. Book reviews published before that time have been included
as separate entries in the chronological listing of Turgenev criticism,
thus giving an approximate idea of the progress of Turgenev studies in
the nineteenth-century Anglo-Saxon world.

Most entries have been personally examined. In addition to checking
entries for Turgenev in the _National Union Catalog_ and in the printed
catalogs of the Library of Congress, the Slavonic Division of The New
York Public Library, and the British Museum, the compilers have also
searched through the collections of Princeton, Harvard, and Columbia
universities.

Much difficulty was encountered in arriving at a satisfactory listing
of the collected editions of Turgenev’s works, especially of the
Garnett and Hapgood translations. These were published piecemeal as
well as complete and the more popular volumes were frequently reissued,
printed from the same plates. We have had to be content with listing
the first publication of each volume in the collected editions, the
dates in which complete sets were reprinted, and then listing whatever
separate reprints we have found to exist. Presumably there are several
more.

Stories published in periodicals often appeared under very
non-Turgenevian titles; as much as possible these have been traced to
the more standard English titles and so noted.

The index includes an alphabetical list of authors and translators,
and an index of titles containing the transliterated Russian titles
and the translated titles of all works listed in this checklist. All
title variations of a translated work are listed in this index under
the Russian title (e. g. for _Liza_ etc see _Dvoryanskoye gnezdo_).
For variant titles of a work for which only one English title is
known, bracketed reference is made after each English title to the
transliterated Russian title.

The compilers are grateful to Marc Slonim for contributing the
introductory essay and to Richard C. Lewanski for his friendly
encouragement. The compilers are also indebted to the work of Royal A.
Gettmann, whose _Turgenev in England and America_ (Univ of Illinois
1941; item 416) critically charted much of the material published
before 1936.

Turgenev Revisited


A hundred years ago, in 1855, the first translations from Turgenev’s
_Sportsman’s Sketches_ appeared in French and British periodicals, and
since that time his works have continued to gain an ever increasing
acclaim in the Western world. Henry James, one of his fervent admirers,
was not exaggerating when he wrote in 1874 that the Russian was “the
first novelist of the day,” and Howells confessed a few years later
that he had formed for Turgenev “one of the profoundest literary
passions” of his life. At the beginning of the present century Arnold
Bennett, asked to name the twelve best novels of world literature,
included six of Turgenev’s in his honor list. Flaubert and Galsworthy,
Conrad and Maupassant paid high tribute to Turgenev and ranked him with
Fielding, Thackeray, and Balzac.

Turgenev was the first Russian writer to conquer large audiences
outside his native land. He actually introduced Russian literature
to Europe and America which, through him, discovered and admired the
originality of Russian genius. The impact of his own work, moreover,
was enhanced by his personal influence. For almost three decades
Turgenev, who spent more time abroad than at home, was recognized as
the ambassador of Russian letters in Europe. Friend of most outstanding
representatives of European art and thought, he was a familiar figure
in Western capitals, and the honorary degree awarded to him by the
University of Oxford was but a small part of the homage paid to him by
his devotees.

Yet despite his unique position and his wide following in almost every
land, Turgenev’s fortunes declined sharply in the twentieth century,
when many reservations were formulated about his work and person. Some
of these qualifications revived old discussions and repeated arguments
known already in Turgenev’s lifetime; some of them, however, were of
more recent origin and expressed doubts peculiar to our century.

It is well known that most of Turgenev’s illustrious French colleagues
as well as Henry James and the Scandinavian-American Boyesen, who
met the Russian personally, always spoke of him as being “completely
Russian.” The brothers Goncourt describe him in their _Journal_ of
1863 as a “white haired giant who looked like the spirit of a mountain
or a forest,” an embodiment of Russian soil; Henry James stressed his
eminently Russian characteristics and his preoccupation with Russian
affairs; and after his death Renan said that “he was the incarnation of
the whole race ... his conscience was in some sort the conscience of a
people.” It is curious that the main reservation of later times dealt
precisely with the problem of Turgenev’s national authenticity. There
is still a widespread opinion that the author of _Fathers and Sons_
became dear to readers outside Russia because of his European formation
and his Western leanings. Alfred Kazin stated not long ago that
Turgenev “seemed of all the great Russians the least characteristic”;
the American critic understands perfectly why Henry James “found it
so easy in 1878 to include an appreciation of Turgenev in _French
Poets and Novelists_.” The familiar thesis is that Europeans and
Americans of the last century loved Turgenev for his moderation, his
conformity to the rules of Victorian art, and his lack of irritating
and disturbing Russian national traits. The supporters of this opinion
point out that Turgenev’s novels and tales are as tame and respectable
as their British counterparts of the same period; his heroines are not
very different from the misses in the English family novels, and his
nests of gentlefolk could be easily located in the countryside on the
other side of the channel or even in Massachusetts or Rhode Island.
Turgenev’s urbane and restrained manners and his polished style, his
gloss and grace, are considered as having been more suitable to and
therefore more naturally appreciated in London and Boston than in
Moscow and St Petersburg (not to speak of Leningrad).

When Tolstoy and Dostoevsky became known and widely read at the end
of the nineteenth century and in the first decades of the twentieth
century, they not only overshadowed Turgenev but were opposed to him as
genuine interpreters of the Russian national scene. Compared to those
two giants who shattered the world by the depth and frenzy of their
moral and religious search, Turgenev lost in stature. Some critics
advanced the theory that he was but an isolated phenomenon in Russian
letters; that in any case he did not represent its main stream. His
art, they argued, was strangely devoid of any serious moral intent,
he never affirmed anything in any area of human endeavour, he never
defended any doctrine and never fought on the side of any group. In
this he differed fundamentally from other Russians. They were believers
or searchers for truth and seekers after God, and he was an agnostic
and a skeptic. He belonged much more to the old world of Western
decadent culture than to the rising lands of the revolutionary East.
And this is why, to quote Mr Kazin again, Turgenev’s “civilized and
European art seems no longer in the foreground of Russian literature
but behind it.” His unhappy noblemen and his delicately portrayed girls
appeared elusive, sentimental, and pallid next to Dostoevsky’s holy
sinners and Tolstoy’s robust, full blooded men and women. While the
rest of Russian literature conveyed the feeling of exuberant vitality
and deep passions, Turgenev’s watercolors exuded melancholy and
passivity, and his protagonists (except for Bazarov) talked and acted
like second rate Werthers or poor versions of Hamlet. Was he not, in
fact, the author of a story entitled _Hamlet of the Shchigrov District_?

One of the few Russians who did not try to preach and to win over
the reader to some credo or idea, Turgenev became suspect even as a
chronicler of his society. Russian critics had always interpreted
Turgenev’s novels as illustrations of the evolutionary process within
the native educated classes between 1850 and 1880. Rudin (1855)
represented the idealist of the forties, Lavretzky (1858) was typical
of the fifties, _On the Eve_ (1860) conveyed the atmosphere of
expectation before the era of great reforms, and Bazarov in _Fathers
and Sons_ (1861) personified the new generation of nihilists. Later
_Smoke_ (1867) and _Virgin Soil_ (1877) reflected the political debate
and the beginnings of the populist movement. Already during Turgenev’s
lifetime his pictures of Russia started numerous discussions, and, as
Edward Garnett said in his essay in 1917, provoked much angry heat and
raised great clouds of acrimonious smoke because the defenders and the
detractors of the writer disagreed about the historical accuracy of
his representation. And fifty years after his death his importance as
a social realist was questioned again. His portrayals of superfluous
men afflicted by idleness or paralysis of the will seemed particularly
inappropriate at a time when the Revolution had unleashed such an
astounding amount of energy in Russia and transformed the whole country
into an immense workshop. Not only was Turgenev lacking in “publicity
value” but when things Russian were popular or when everybody was
trying to solve the riddles of Russia’s present regime, Turgenev could
hardly help. Charles Morgan said in this connection that Turgenev was
too unspectacular, too moderate and patient in spirit. Besides, his
protagonists did not look like ancestors of twentieth-century Russians
(again excepting Bazarov). And this led to an obvious conclusion:
his novels and tales belonged to another age, they were visions of
the past, and theirs was the quaint charm of early daguerreotypes in
period frames. Turgenev was old fashioned, dated, and offered only
an historical interest. Of course, it would be erroneous to identify
any work of fiction with a straight representation of reality, but in
Turgenev’s case it was assumed that, while not making an exception
to the rule, he was especially insensitive to Russia’s historical
development. He could not foresee its future and never went beyond the
limitations of the small social group to which he belonged and which he
depicted with an almost annoying monotony.

Doubts were also cast on Turgenev’s art. In the nineteenth century
even those who wondered about Turgenev’s national authenticity or his
social philosophy and historical accuracy recognized his craft and
mastery. Yet the same George Moore who spoke of Turgenev’s “unfailing
artistry” in the eighties, later reproached him as having “a thinness,
an irritating reserve,” and repeated the quip of a British journalist
who remarked that the Russian was “a very big man playing a very small
instrument.” The same George Moore echoed the discontent of the younger
generation with Turgenev’s lack of psychological depth: “he has often
seemed to us to have left much unsaid, to have, as it were, only drawn
the skin from his subject. Magnificently well is the task performed;
but we should like to have seen the carcass disembowelled and hung up.”
Maurice Baring wrote in the twenties that Turgenev’s works were dated,
that he was inaccurate as a social historian and did not reflect the
true Russia, and that his subject matter was too narrow. Others added
in the thirties that Turgenev, this minor Hamlet who depicted unhappy
love affairs of aristocratic ladies, covered only a small area of
Russian reality. He was not sufficiently dynamic or varied, there was
something effeminate about his manner, and his lyrical qualities were
superficial. In general his art was too contrived and self conscious,
its gentility simply expressing an organic lack of directness and
vitality. A German critic of the thirties found “sweet and pleasant
this art for convalescents which makes one agreeably drowsy.”

While Marxist critics were inclined to see in Turgenev a “literary
ghost from a sunken world of landed gentry” whose pessimism expressed
the doom of his own class, others attacked the very smoothness of
Turgenev’s style. Alexis Remizov, an outstanding emigré novelist who
appreciated Turgenev and refused to “simplify” problems deriving from
his work, identified him nevertheless with the “Karamzine line of
Russian letters”: in the opinion of Remizov and many of his followers,
Karamzine initiated in the eighteenth century that artificial literary
idiom of the upper classes which abandoned the racy genuine language
of the people and imitated the literary models of the West. The
Karamzine-Turgenev-Chekhov trend of elegance, restraint, and linguistic
refinement was opposed by the truly national tradition of pre-Petrine
Russia with its down-to-earth realism, Greek-Orthodox and pagan roots,
and popular vernacular. From that point of view Turgenev again was
declared “unfit for our times, not representative as a Russian writer,”
edulcorated and conventional as an artist.

While all these criticisms were widespread in literary circles of
the thirties, World War II and its aftermath brought about a change
of heart and a revision of current judgments of Turgenev. Apparently
readers both in Russia and the Western countries as well as throughout
Asia (particularly in China and Japan) showed more stability than
the critics: they did not seem to find Turgenev so dated as to drop
him. Turgenev emerged as one of the most popular authors in the Soviet
Union, particularly in the decade following the war with Hitler.
Between 1948 and 1958 the USSR press turned out an average of three
to four million copies of his works yearly, and in America and Europe
there was a definite revival of interest. His novels and short stories
were issued in new translations and found a large following among young
and old.

It is evident that only few went to Turgenev for wisdom on the fate
of communism or to gain some “first hand knowledge of Russia,” a
fashionable slogan of the time. But historians of literature and
students of Turgenev suddenly discovered more profound reasons for
his hundred-year hold over the general public. Charles Morgan, in an
essay in his _Reflections in a Mirror_ (1944), observed that Turgenev
was criticised for his calm and his outward lack of dynamism, but
then appropriately quoted Tolstoy’s letter to Strakhov (Dostoevsky’s
biographer and disciple) after Turgenev’s death: “The longer I live,”
wrote Tolstoy, “the more I like horses that are not restive. You say
that you are reconciled to Turgenev. And I have come to love him very
much, and curiously enough, just because he is not restive but gets
to his destination. Turgenev will outlive Dostoevsky and not for his
artistic qualities but because he is not restive.”

Tolstoy pointed out that Turgenev’s quiet tone was the result of
control and not indifference. The strength of his understatement,
enhanced by the neatness of his composition, was based on his
essential humanity. Therefore it is erroneous to rank Turgenev with
the representatives of the “well-made novel.” Of course, he used the
“dramatic technique,” followed strictly the rule of the withdrawal of
the author from his narrative, and built the latter on the revelation
of characters through their actions and words. But he never tried to
conceal his aversions and sympathies. The spontaneity of his emotional
response and the freedom of his treatment of topics and characters made
his works totally different from conventional Anglo-Saxon standards and
from the French logical formality in constructing the “well-made novel.”

What led to errors of evaluation were his serene diction and his
belief that a good work of art must never lose its equilibrium or
poise, even when dealing with anxiety and madness. He praised highly
the “tranquillity in passion” of the French tragedian Rachel and spoke
of her acting as a model of high esthetic fulfillment. Actually, the
subject matter of Turgenev’s novels and tales is far from idyllic: his
love stories inevitably terminate in doom and frustration, and none
of his novels has a happy ending, death striking most of his heroes.
Throughout his works Turgenev displays an acute sense of the tragic in
life and a constant preoccupation with man’s condition on earth. Yet
this pessimism is far from strident, and the writer’s most poignant
emotions and reflections are always expressed in an even voice, without
outbursts of despair. Turgenev loves order, symmetry, balance, and
radiance, and he presents a harmonized picture of life which makes
his work appear self-contained. There is a world which can rightly be
called “Turgenevian,” and it stands in its own right as a complete and
rounded achievement.

It could be argued that such an esthetic phenomenon is of sufficient
importance to justify Turgenev’s appeal in 1961. But other factors
should be noted to understand the recent revival of interest in his
work. Today we find Turgenev much more “authentically Russian” than
did readers of half a century ago. _Fathers and Sons_ should be
required reading for anyone who wishes to understand the psychology of
the Russian post-revolutionary generation. Bazarov is the forerunner
of all the men of action in Soviet literature, in much the same way
that Elena, Marianna, and Natalia are typical representatives of
Russia’s modern women. It is not difficult to discover that Turgenev’s
characters, despite their old fashioned garb, are more fundamentally
national than many exotic figures of post-Turgenev fiction who were
branded by sensation-craving readers as “true Russians.”

For another thing, Turgenev, with his method of understatement (which
Chekhov followed), is closer to modern literary trends than other
realists of his own age. One can easily foresee that his tales—and
they are probably the best and most enduring part of his work—will
attract the attention and admiration of readers and writers for a
long time, because they form a counterpart to the era of exaggerated
psychologism which is rapidly approaching its decline. Nobody
today will accuse Turgenev of “lack of psychological depth” or of
over-simplicity. In his own unobtrusive manner, Turgenev hinted at all
the complexities of the human soul and alluded to the hidden roots of
human actions. In the dreams in Turgenev’s works is an unsuspected
wealth of psychological insight.

Virginia Woolf, in her last essays, wrote that “his books were
curiously of our own time, undecayed, and complete in themselves....
His novels are so short and yet they hold so much. The emotion is
so intense and yet so calm. The form is in one sense so perfect, in
another so broken. They are about Russia in the fifties and sixties
of the last century, and yet they are about ourselves at the present
moment.” What struck her as his greatest accomplishment was the union
of fact and vision that he aimed at in all his writings. Turgenev
himself formulated his ideal in a letter in which he said that the
artist should not be simply satisfied to catch life in all its
manifestations; he ought to understand them, to comprehend the laws
according to which they evolve—even though those laws are not always
visible.

While Turgenev’s national authenticity has been fully reestablished
in the last decade and his universality and perfection often stressed
by Western and Russian writers, a revision has also taken place with
regard to his “objectivity.” The legend of his “impersonality” has
been easily denounced by the psychological brand of criticism which
found that Turgenev, as an individual, was prey to morbid complexes
and obsessions, and suffered from many inner contradictions and fears.
Already at the end of the nineteenth century George Moore assumed that
“what influenced Turgenev’s life is put forward in his books,” and
went on to argue that Turgenev exposed his own weaknesses and failures
through the medium of his heroes and their unlucky experiences with
life and women. Extremely representative of this trend in contemporary
interpretation is the brilliant essay (1958) by Edmund Wilson which
examines Turgenev’s art in the light of his biography.

Of course the flow of literary fortune is in constant ebb, and the
rejection of yesterday’s formulae by critics and readers of our time
is not final. Yet one has the feeling that we have overcome the biased
and inimical judgments of the beginning of the century and particularly
those of the twenties and thirties. Turgenev is returning to the
Pantheon of world literature, not by sufferance but by merit. His
lasting qualities as a story teller, as a painter of Russian life and
character, and as an incomparable analyst of love seem more evident
to us today than they did to the pre-war generation. He will remain a
beloved writer for years to come—as long as elegiac grief combined
with his exaltation of love and beauty and his vision of art as an
orderly arrangement of emotional values can still quicken the feelings
and the esthetic sense of men and women throughout the world.

    This is substantially the Scribner edition, with only title-pages,
    and the order of volumes changed. The same plates were used. Another
    edition of 14 volumes in 7, also using the Scribner plates, was
    issued at the same time by the Jefferson Press, Boston, as a deluxe
    edition.

    Other publishers of this same Lauriat set were Brentano, New York,
    who also reprinted the 14 v. in 7 in 1915 and 1916; and
    Himebaugh-Browne, New York, who apparently issued only a few of the
    7 volumes. Scribner’s again issued the 7 volumes in 1915, with the
    volume numbers altered. Lauriat reprinted the 7 volumes in 1914.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
