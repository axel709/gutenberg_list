                           PORRIDGE POETRY




                          THE PORRIDGE POET

                Dear Children, I would have you know it:
                That this is me, the Porridge Poet,
                My inspiration’s in the ice-box;
                My rhymes I pick out from the spice-box.

                My verse is very free and easy,
                Its flavour sometimes slightly cheesy;
                But that, my friends, is no great crime in
                The gentle art of kitchen rhymin’.

                I’ve made delicious maccaronics
                From peelings off spring philharmonics.
                And as for comic songs or ballads,
                I turn them out like summer salads.

                ’Tis to the cook-book that I owe it,
                My reputation as a poet.
                And if you’ll watch my pot a minute
                I’ll show you how I mix things in it.

                Now take a pint of vermicelli
                And pound it to a nice smooth jelly;
                If necessary use a hammer.
                Then add a pinch or two of grammar.

                Shake in an ounce of sifted syntax
                And half a teaspoonful of tin tacks,
                Then flavour with eggstravaganza,
                And there you have a lovely stanza!

                            VERA VIRGINIA

            Oh, what a popular person I am!
            My full name is Vera Virginia Ham.
            The barn-dance, the two-step, the sausage-roll trot,
            The pig-jig, the hog-jog, I dance the whole lot.

                          THE LOLLIPOPINJAY

                On lollipops I live. I’m gay;
                I leap and swirl, I spin and sway.
                Come join me in the dance, I pray!
                Let’s go!--Slap-bang!--Hip, hip, hooray!

                For I’m the lollipopinjay.
                I loll by night, I dance all day.
                I jump, I crouch and pop away
                Skip! Hop!--Tip-top!--Hip, hip, hooray!

[Illustration: THE LOLLIPOPINJAY]


                       LATITUDES AND LONGITUDES

                    ’Twas in the tropic latitudes
                    That we were talking platitudes,
                    Just sailor-like chit-chatitudes,
                      As any ship-mates might.

                    We forgot to take our longitude
                    (Which was a grievous wrongitude)
                    So we didn’t reach Hong-kongitude
                      Till very late that night.

                      THE FLEDGELING AND THE BUG

                    “Are you the kind of insect, Sir,
                    “My mother calls digestible?”
                    Enquired the little fledgeling of
                    The Sweet Potato Bug.

                    “I’m nothing of the kind, my friend.
                    “My taste is just detestable--
                    “And so is yours--Such impudence!”
                    He answered with a shrug.

                                PICNIC

                            Ella, fell a
                            Maple tree.
                            Hilda, build a
                            Fire for me.

                            Teresa, squeeze a
                            Lemon, so.
                            Amanda, hand a
                            Plate to Flo.

                            Nora, pour a
                            Cup of tea.
                            Fancy, Nancy,
                            What a spree!

[Illustration: PICNIC]


                        SCALLYWAG AND GOLLYWOG

            Scally Wag and Golly Wog
            Took their bag aboard a log
                And started off to cross the ocean blue.
            They’re still at sea, I have no doubt,
            For all they do is fight about
                Which shall be the Captain, which the crew.

                           THE PALM FAMILY

                    Nearby an African lagoon
                    Beneath the silent yellow moon
                    All safe from worries and alarms
                    There dwelt a family of palms.

                    It was a peaceful life they led
                    Mr. and Mrs. and little Fred;
                    And when the wind blew soft and low
                    They’d whisper tales of long ago.

                         THE FOOD-HYMN OF THE
                             COOK-GOBLINS

                Down where the glow-worms faintly glitter,
                Down where the fire-flies gleam and flitter,
                Come listen to the sausage twitter,
                    Sizz and crackle in the pan!
                Tripe or truffles, fancy fishes,
                It doesn’t matter what your wish is;
                None prepare such luscious dishes
                    As we, the gay Cook-goblins, can.

[Illustration: THE COOK-GOBLINS]


                            SCRUBBY CHUBBY

    Such a scowling and a growling, howling yowling for a toy,
    You grubby, snubby, tubby, chubby, scrubby little boy!

[Illustration: SCRUBBY CHUBBY]


                               OOM-PAH

                Oom-pah, boom-pah, oom-pah boom!
                Like roses soon our cheeks will bloom.
                We only ask for elbow-room
                Oom-pah, boom-pah, oom-pah boom!

[Illustration: OOM-PAH]


                             MISTER BEERS

            This is Mister Beers:
                And for forty-seven years
            He’s been digging in his garden like a miner.
                He isn’t planting seeds
                Nor scratching up the weeds,
            He’s trying to bore a tunnel down to China.

                    THE PIRATE OF THE KITCHEN SINK

                And who might this be, should you think?
                Why, the pirate of the kitchen sink!
                A dish-rag sail, a spoon for oar,
                Could any captain wish for more?

                Aboard his racing coffee-pot
                He roams an ocean steaming hot.
                No cup or saucer stays afloat
                That dares to bump into his boat.

[Illustration: THE PIRATE OF THE KITCHEN SINK]


                          THE MILLINERY BIRD

                A friendly Arctic Puffin asked
                The Millinery Bird,
                “Aren’t the styles they’re wearing now
                “A little bit absurd?”

                “Oh well,” sarcastically said
                The other with a snigger,
                “That will depend, my squatty friend,
                “_Entirely_ on your figure.”

[Illustration: THE MILLINERY BIRD]


                      MR. PARRY AND MRS. PRINGLE

                    Said Mrs. Pringle to Mr. Parry,
                    “Tell me why you never marry?”

                    Said Mr. Parry to Mrs. Pringle,
                    “Life is so much simpler single.”

[Illustration: MR. PARRY AND MRS. PRINGLE]


                              WEI HAI WO

                    A sage there was long, long ago,
                    A mandarin named Wei Hai Wo,
                    And at his window all day long
                    He sat and softly hummed this song
                      “How silly, Lily, lackaday!
                        “Deary daisy me!”

                    Said young Sin Ching to Wei Hai Wo,
                    “Please tell me why you sit there so?
                    I never chance this way to come
                    But that I always hear you hum,
                      “How silly, Lily, lackaday!
                        “Deary daisy me!”

                    “Well listen, friend,” said Wei Hai Wo,
                    “I love to watch the passing show,
                    “I take things easy, good and bad.
                    “Why should I rush through life like mad?
                      “How silly, Lily, lackaday!
                        “Deary, daisy me!”

                    “If others wish to run about
                    “Then let them. But let me look out.
                    “I’ve found that peace, my good Sin Ching,
                    “Is quite the most important thing.
                    “You see now why I sit and sing,
                      “How silly, Lily, lackaday!
                        “Deary, daisy me!”

                         THE VEGETABLE SCHOOL

                    Teaching school is not so easy,
                    Be it big, or be it small,
                    With a Spring term class made up of
                    Vegetable scholars all.

                    Make the turnips turn their toes out.
                    See the pumpkins punctuate.
                    Have the parsnips parse correctly.
                    Let us, Lettuce, start at eight.

                    Lima Bean’s been most provoking.
                    Send him to the garden bed.
                    Artful artichoke, I see you
                    Beating beet upon the head.

                    Spinach, spin your tops outside, please.
                    Take two sevenths from a whole.
                    Carrot, carry one and add, dear.
                    Cauliflower, call the roll.

                           THE WAFFLE-KITE

            This is the Waffle-Kite
            And oh, what an awful sight
            He looks when he digs in the marsh with his beak.
            Mud pies it’s fun to make
            To set in the sun to bake
            When you’ve got the right kind of face, so to speak.

                           CHRISTMAS DOUGH

                For Christmas Day the Christmas dough
                Is kneaded high and kneaded low.
                Punch it thick and thump it thin,
                Flatten it out with a rolling-pin.

                In the kitchen’s lots of fun
                When Christmas pie and Christmas bun
                Are kneaded high and kneaded low
                From lovely, squodgy, Christmas dough.

                         LOOSE IN THE MIDDLE

                Hey diddle, diddle,
                I’m loose in the middle.
                Why can’t I get on with myself?
                It’s not my digestion--
                That’s out of the question,
                ’Cause I left it at home on the shelf.

[Illustration: LOOSE IN THE MIDDLE]


                            THE BOTTICELLO

                In Florence Signor Quaverello
                Would play the four-string botticello
                Every single Sunday night, ’tis said.

                Until his wife upstairs would bellow
                “You noisy, good-for-nothing fellow!
                      “Hello!
                      “Quaverello!
                “Put that thing away and come to bed!”

                          THE TOFFEE ANALYST

                    “Oh, I’m the Toffee Analyst
                    So learned and sophisticky;
                    I’m making out a candy list,
                    It’s going to be statisticky.”

                      UP WRIGHT AND DOWN WRIGHT

                Long ago the Brothers Wright
                  Were men of odd but great renown,
                As different as day and night,
                  The neighbors called them Up and Down.

                Now Up Wright was devout and lean,
                  Proper, virtuous and prim.
                Whenever he felt low or mean
                  He merely sighed or sang a hymn.

                A queerer pair was never made;
                  For Down Wright, short and thick,
                Who always called a spade a spade,
                  Loved to argue, fight and kick.

                Yet through the ups and downs of life
                  Through thick and thin, through good and ill,
                In spite of all their constant strife
                  The brothers lived together still.

                 THE LEGEND OF THE SEA-SICK SEA-GULL

        Once there was a herring gull
        Who found the ocean very dull
        Said he, “I’m always sea-sick on the silly rolling sea.

        “I’ll go ashore and settle down
        In some peaceful country town
        And wear my carpet-slippers when I drink my china tea.”

                        JIM NAST OF PAWTUCKET

                Here’s little Jim Nast of Pawtucket
                Who slid down the stairs in a bucket.
                He has more understanding
                Since reaching the landing.
                Just look at the hole where he struck it!

                            CLIPPETY CLOP!

                Clippety, snippety, clippety, clop!
                A pretty pernickety barber’s shop!
                Walk up! Walk in and have a shave,
                A dry shampoo--a marcel wave,
                Your whiskers trimmed in any style.
                Come in, sit down and stay a while.
                Soon the barber chimpanzees
                Will bow and smile and say, “Next please!
                “We’re always busy--never stop.
                “Clippety, snippety, clippety, clop!”

                “Oh won’t you be my Valentine
                “This wintertime, sweet Turpentine?”

                “How can I be, Petroleum?
                “I’m promised to Linoleum.”

                     THE MILK AND HONEY HONEYMOON

                    The Milky Way was made for you,
                    The Honey-Moon for me.
                    If we could only mix the two
                    How happy we should be!

                    With a milk-and-honey honeymoon,
                    You see, my charming wife,
                    We’d only need a table-spoon
                    And we’d be fixed for life.

                              GIBBERISH

                    Sing a song of gibberish,
                      For this is rhyming day;
                    Hasty pudding, stirabout,
                      A goulash roundelay.

                    Sing a junket rigmarole,
                      A shindig jamboree,
                      Catalogues or doggerels,
                    They’re all the same to me.

                          MRS. VAN DER HOOK

                    There was a little lady and
                      her name was Mrs. Van der Hook.
                    She lived upon the main street of
                      the town of Amsterdam.
                    And when the neighbors told her it
                      was very rude to stand and look,
                    All she ever answered was,
                      “Well that’s the way I am.”

                          THE RAT AND GUITAR

                You’ve heard of the Cat and the Fiddle,
                  Well, I am the Rat and Guitar.
                    I play by the moon
                  Such a beautiful toon
                The Cat goes on sleeping--Ha! Ha!

                         BETWIXT AND BETWEEN

                Betwixt and Between were two betwins,
                Their father’s name was Twoddle.
                They’ve been alike as a pair of pins
                Since they could scarcely toddle.

                         THE KITCHEN KALENDAR

                        Pastry and Bun day
                        Ought to be Monday.
                        Then Irish Stews-day
                        Falls on a Tuesday.

                        Dine-out-with-friends day,
                        Let’s make that Wednesday.
                        Next, Apple-pie day
                        Should always be Friday.

                        Sausage-in-batter day,
                        Put that down Saturday.
                        But what about Sunday?
                        Oh, take a rest one day.

                      The Household Drudge
                      Was making fudge
                    In a great big china basin.
                      Alas! Alack!
                      She turned her back
                    And the poodle dipped his face in!

          Good morning Cornucopia!
          Your face looks even soapier
        Than when I met you walking yesterday.

          I know it, dear Symposium,
          My complexion got so rosium
        I covered it with lather and I left it there to stay.

                Gimcrack and Gewgaw
                Were riding a see-saw
                And Gewgaw was up in the air.
                There popped up a rabbit,
                And Gim ran to grab it.
                Said Gew, “Oh, that’s not playing fair!”

    Said Auntie Macassar to Miss Lulu Gubrious
    “Isn’t the weather just simply salubrious?”
    “Why, no,” answered Lulu, “I think it’s monotonous.
    “Just think if the rain should have gone and forgotten us!”

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
