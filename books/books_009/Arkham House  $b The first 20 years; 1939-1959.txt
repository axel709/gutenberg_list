                       ARKHAM HOUSE: Publishers
                   Sauk City, Wisconsin        1959




Though it was not immediately foreseen, Arkham House had its inception
in the death of Howard Phillips Lovecraft on March 15, 1937. The
first word of Lovecraft’s death came in a letter from the late Howard
Wandrei, then in New York, a letter I read on my way into the marshes
below Sauk City, where I had intended to spend an afternoon reading
Thoreau’s _Journal_. Instead, I sat at a railroad trestle beside the
brook and considered ways and means of putting together Lovecraft’s
best works and bringing them out in book form.

I was under no illusions about the difficulty of persuading a New York
publisher to bring out such a collection, for, in the broadest sense,
Lovecraft was relatively obscure, he wrote in a vein for which there
has never been too large an audience, and all his previous submissions
of book manuscripts to publishers like Putnam, Knopf and others had
been futile--though it should be said in favor of the publishers and
their readers that Lovecraft, certain of their failure, customarily
submitted dog-eared, hardly legible manuscripts, which were certainly
enough to discourage all but the most hardy reader.

Once back at my typewriter later that afternoon, I wrote Donald Wandrei
that something should be done to keep Lovecraft’s work in print; he
replied that collecting only the stories, as I had thought to do, was
not enough--all the work should be collected and eventually published,
including the marvellously instructive and entertaining letters. I
lost no further time in collecting and arranging the stories, which
were put into typescript by my then secretary, Alice Conger, and
immediately submitted to Charles Scribner’s Sons. Scribner’s were at
that time my own publishers, and, while sympathetic to the project and
cognizant of the literary value of Lovecraft’s fiction, rejected the
manuscript because the cost of producing so bulky a book, combined with
the public’s then sturdy resistance to buying short story collections
and the comparative obscurity of H. P. Lovecraft as a writer, made
the project financially prohibitive. Simon & Schuster, to whom the
manuscript was next submitted, likewise rejected, for similar reasons.

It was at this point that the idea of publishing the omnibus under an
imprint of our own occurred to me and took hold. I wrote again to
Donald Wandrei, setting forth my plan. Both of us were impecunious
writers--and how rare is the writer who is not!--but I was at that time
building a home for which a local bank had advanced a considerable loan
(not, however, without four times the amount of the loan in collateral,
as is the invariable custom of banks), and it occurred to me that there
was one manifest course open to a would-be publisher--to advertise for
advance prepaid orders, and to pay off the printer from the sum of my
loan. To this, Donald Wandrei added what small sum he could scrape
together at that time, at great personal sacrifice; and, with the full
co-operation of Lovecraft’s surviving aunt, Mrs. Annie E. Phillips
Gamwell, and Robert H. Barlow, the project took shape.

There was never any question about the name of our publishing house.
_Arkham House_ suggested itself at once, since it was Lovecraft’s
own well-known, widely-used place-name for legend-haunted Salem,
Massachusetts, in his remarkable fiction; it seemed to us that
this was fitting and that Lovecraft himself would have approved it
enthusiastically. And, once the project had been decided upon, there
was never any question about the printer chosen to do it--we turned
at once to the nearest, most widely-known printer--the George Banta
Company of Menasha, Wisconsin, whose plant was only a hundred miles
distant.

But by this time two years had elapsed since Lovecraft’s death, and by
the time initial announcements of the work appeared in _Weird Tales_,
offering prepaid advance-ordered copies of _The Outsider and Others_--a
title selected because it had been once mentioned by Lovecraft himself
as a possible title for a collection of his work, and because Lovecraft
was in a very real sense, as well as in his own concept of himself, an
outsider in the twentieth century--the book was being made ready for
publication, Donald Wandrei was reading proof, and labels were being
printed for shipment of copies. Advance-ordered, prepaid copies of the
book were offered at $3.50 the copy, in contrast to the published price
of $5.00 for the omnibus, of which 1,268 copies were delivered to me in
late 1939.

Incredible as it may seem to today’s ardent searchers for that first
Lovecraft collection, orders at $3.50 the copy came in very slowly.
By publication, only 150 prepaid orders had come in. To the sum thus
collected, Donald Wandrei added $400.00; the remainder of the not
small sum was lifted, much to the horror of the local bankers, from
my loan (though it was soon replaced--not out of earnings from sales,
but out of my personal income from various writing projects). The book
did not lack publicity; our venture was given generous space in the
_Publishers’ Weekly_ and other trade media, though it was so thoroughly
ignored locally that even today, after two decades, not one in fifty
persons in Sauk City and the area of the village could identify Arkham
House if asked to do so by an outsider.

_The Outsider and Others_ sold with discouraging slowness.
Nevertheless, it seemed to me, judging by the enthusiasm shown by
buyers, that there might be a market for small editions of books in
the general field of fantasy, perhaps with emphasis on the macabre
or science-fiction. To that end, I prepared early in 1941 a slender
collection of my own best stories in the genre and submitted them,
according to my contractual obligations, to Charles Scribner’s Sons.
Up to this time there had been no thought of publishing through Arkham
House the work of anyone but H. P. Lovecraft; it remained for William
C. Weber of Scribner’s to suggest that my collection, _Someone in the
Dark_, ought properly to be published under the Arkham House imprint,
since a specialized house could very probably do better with such a
book than could Scribner’s.

After much soul-searching, I took Weber’s advice, and brought out
_Someone in the Dark_ at $2.00 the copy. This had the additional effect
of keeping the Arkham House imprint before the public eye while other
Lovecraft works were in preparation. When the initial costs of the
second Arkham House book were met before those of _The Outsider and
Others_, I began to explore the possibility of publishing further books
in the field. Despite the fact that because of his induction into the
U. S. Army, where he served four years, Donald Wandrei was forced to
sever all but the most cursory connection with Arkham House in 1942,
that year saw publication of the third Arkham House title, Clark Ashton
Smith’s _Out of Space and Time_, at $3.00 the copy.

The three-dollar price seemed to be the most satisfactory one; the
publishers could honestly show that $2.00 was too little, and readers
had complained that $5.00 was too much for a book in 1939--though some
of those same plaintiffs, having refused _The Outsider and Others_
at $5.00, paid $25.00 and $35.00 for it ten years later, even $50.00
and $65.00. Yet the $5.00 price had to be maintained for the omnibus
collections, and in 1943 the second Lovecraft omnibus, _Beyond the Wall
of Sleep_, was published in an edition limited by wartime restrictions
to but 1,217 copies.

The first quartet of books to bear the imprint of Arkham
House--published from 1939 to 1944--though getting off to a slow
selling start with the initial Lovecraft title, had by the end of 1943
gained such momentum that it was obvious that few if any of these books
would be left for sale by the end of 1944. _The Outsider and Others_
took four years to sell out its only printing, and actually, what with
overhead and other costs, it took approximately that long to return
our initial investment. But by 1944 it was manifest that there was
a distinct--if relatively small--market for collections of weird,
fantastic, science-fiction short stories, and I determined to publish
as many such collections as possible, with emphasis on the hitherto
unpublished, but not scorning works long out of print.

Pushing ahead, I commissioned Frank Utpatel, the Wisconsin artist who
had done the illustrations for Lovecraft’s _The Shadow Over Innsmouth_
in 1936, to design a house colophon. This made its first appearance in
our next book, Donald Wandrei’s _The Eye and the Finger_. In addition
to this title, three other Arkham House titles appeared in 1944; they
were Henry S. Whitehead’s _Jumbee and Other Uncanny Tales_; Clark
Ashton Smith’s _Lost Worlds_, and _Marginalia_, by H. P. Lovecraft,
with contributions by others. By the end of 1945, the Arkham House list
had been augmented by the addition of my own Something Near; Robert
Bloch’s _The Opener of the Way_; the first Arkham House fantasy novel,
Evangeline Walton’s _Witch House_; J. Sheridan LeFanu’s _Green Tea
and Other Ghost Stories_; and _The Lurker at the Threshold_, a novel
suggested in notes and fragments written by Lovecraft, finished by
myself.

The year 1945 was also the year in which Arkham House introduced two
allied imprints--Mycroft & Moran, specializing in off-trail sleuthing
tales, the first of which was my own _“In Re: Sherlock Holmes”--The
Adventures of Solar Pons_, a collection of pastiches of Sherlock
Holmes published at the urging of Vincent Starrett, who wrote the
introduction for the volume, and Ellery Queen, who was to write the
introduction for the later _The Memoirs of Solar Pons_; and Stanton
& Lee, which concentrated on reprints or on collections of comic
cartoons, principally those by the late Clare Victor Dwiggins, and
which made its bow with Dwig’s _Bill’s Diary_, the Derleth-Dwig
juvenile for pixilated adults, _Oliver_, _the Wayward Owl_, and a new
printing of my Scribner novel, _Evening in Spring_, from the Scribner
plates. The Mycroft & Moran imprint came straight out of the Holmes
canon--from Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock’s illustrious brother, and Colonel
Sebastian Moran, the second most dangerous man in London. The house
colophon was designed as a deerstalker by Ronald Clyne. Stanton & Lee
took rise from the names of two friends, one an employee; its colophons
were designed by Howard Wandrei--which appeared only in _Evening in
Spring_--and by Ronald Clyne.

Publication of the initial LeFanu collection, of stories long out of
print in America, marked the beginning of Arkham House’s importation
of titles from abroad. Since many of the best writers in the genre
were British, it seemed to me necessary to add to our list such names
as would bring prestige to the Arkham House imprint. Thus, the year
1946 witnessed publication of four British importations--Algernon
Blackwood’s last book of new work, _The Doll and One Other_; A. E.
Coppard’s _Fearful Pleasures_; H. Russell Wakefield’s _The Clock
Strikes Twelve_, and an omnibus reprint of four novels--William Hope
Hodgson’s _The House on the Borderland and Other Novels_; as well as
three books by members of the Lovecraft circle of writers who, like
him, contributed primarily to _Weird Tales_ in earlier years--Frank
Belknap Long’s _The Hounds of Tindalos_; Robert E. Howard’s _Skull-Face
and Others_; and Henry S. Whitehead’s _West India Lights_, together
with the first Arkham House science-fiction novel, the popular
_Astounding Science-Fiction_ serial, _Slan_, by A. E. Van Vogt.

The year 1946 was in a sense a year of publishing instruction. It
was not until that year, for example, that I finally learned what
the average size of a printing ought to be--not 4,000, which some
of our books had run, but 2,000, with occasional printings of up to
3,000. By that year the limited space in my home was being taken up
by Arkham House stock, despite the fact that books sold rapidly.
The experiences of that year also demonstrated conclusively that a
small publishing business like Arkham House could afford very little
overhead. Indeed, had it not been for the pouring into Arkham House of
$25,000 of personal income from my writing over the first ten years,
the House could not have survived. I had come to publishing without any
previous experience, other than a limited editorial stint with Fawcett
Publications, with which I had been associated briefly in 1930-31; and
I had to learn step by step, often painfully, invariably expensively.
In 1946, production costs had begun to rise also, still further cutting
into any possible profit margin, since the price of Arkham House books
remained fixed.

Nevertheless, despite increased costs of publication, Arkham House in
1947 released Lady Cynthia Asquith’s _This Mortal Coil_; Ray Bradbury’s
first distinguished collection, _Dark Carnival_ (later revised and
issued under the Ballantine imprint as _The October Country_); Carl
Jacobi’s _Revelations in Black_; my own anthology of fantastic and
macabre poetry, _Dark of the Moon_; Fritz Leiber Jr.’s _Night’s Black
Agents_; and, under the Mycroft & Moran imprint, William Hope Hodgson’s
_Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder_, a far more comprehensive collection than
the British edition of almost forty years before, since it contained
three new stories, two never before printed, discovered among Hodgson’s
manuscripts by his sister.

In 1948, in addition to the publication of five titles, Arkham House
brought out its only illustrated book, Seabury Quinn’s _Roads_, with
pictures by Virgil Finlay, and inaugurated the publication of a
literary quarterly, _The Arkham Sampler_, devoted to matters fantastic,
publishing fiction, poetry, letters, articles, bibliographical data,
_et alia_, to sell at $1.00 the copy. This venture, however, was
ill-fated; it was begun in a falling market and at a time of greatly
increased production costs, and, while the subscription to the first
four issues readily met costs, that for the second year, 1949, failed
to do so, and the magazine--which was taking an inexcusably large
amount of the editor-publisher’s time--was reluctantly discontinued,
since Arkham House could not publish it at a loss of both time and
money.

The close of the first decade of publishing saw a substantial number of
Arkham House titles out of print--_The Outsider and Others_, _Someone
in the Dark_, _Out of Space and Time_, _Beyond the Wall of Sleep_, _The
Eye and the Finger_, _Jumbee and Other Uncanny Tales_, _Lost Worlds_,
_Marginalia_, _Something Near_, _The Opener of the Way_, _Slan_, _Green
Tea and Other Ghost Stories_--and selling for fantastic prices in the
out-of-print shops. Recent titles had doubled in value, and the rare
first Arkham House book had been reported as sold at $100.00 for a
pristine copy. In addition, adjunctive books prepared by the editor
for release under the Rinehart imprint out of New York--anthologies
like _Sleep No More_, _Who Knocks?_ and _The Night Side_--were likewise
out of print, and others, prepared for Pellegrini & Cudahy, were being
reprinted--_The Sleeping and the Dead_, _Strange Ports of Call_, _The
Other Side of the Moon_. Most significant of all, by 1950 almost a
dozen other small houses had mushroomed into existence to follow
the lead of Arkham House, and several major publishing houses were
bringing out science-fiction.

Nevertheless, it was evident that the crest of the wave of interest
in fantasy had been reached, and that the recession was certain to
follow. Arkham House therefore prepared, after but two books in 1949,
to hedge the ambitious program announced in that year. A cautious,
if predominantly optimistic conservatism prevailed; had it been
otherwise, Arkham House would certainly have shared the fate of most
of its imitators, which, lacking any real editorial guidance from
people widely-read in the field, spewed forth many books of no merit
whatsoever, cluttered the market, and succeeded in turning away
potential buyers from the field in general.

When, in the mid-fifties, Arkham House began to resume a publishing
schedule, production costs were so high that the price range could no
longer be held. The entry of competitive publishers in the genre had
had one other unhappy effect which directly influenced the decision
in regard to prices--whereas, heretofore, between 400 and 600 patrons
of Arkham House sent in prepaid orders for each announced title, thus
enabling Arkham House to meet printer’s bills within a reasonable time
and assure the continuance of a publishing program, such advance-order
patrons had now been reduced to between 100 and 200, not enough to
give permanence to any program. A disproportionate share of sales was
now being made through the trade which, however welcome, meant the
introduction of middlemen--wholesalers and retailers--into what had
been primarily a publisher-reader mail order operation. This resulted
in a vital slashing of potential income in the face of a very high and
increasing production cost, so that the old $3.00 price could be held
only for collections of verse or very slender collections of stories,
while other books had to go to $3.50 and $4.00, and even, in some
cases, to $5.00, though the $4.00 price was to become the average.

All Arkham House books--together with those under the Mycroft & Moran
and Stanton & Lee imprints--have been printed and bound by the George
Banta Company, with the exception of _The Arkham Sampler_, which was
produced by the Howe Printing Company of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin,
and _Night’s Yawning Peal_ and _Tales from Underwood_, which were
published jointly with Pellegrini & Cudahy of New York, an arrangement
which did not work out satisfactorily and was soon terminated. All
Arkham House books were printed from type set and broken down after but
one printing, except for _The Memoirs of Solar Pons_, which was plated,
for use as a selection of The Unicorn Mystery Book Club.

For Arkham House jackets, various artists have been called upon,
chiefly, however, Ronald Clyne of New York, and Frank Utpatel of
Wisconsin. Among other artists who designed jackets for Arkham House
were Frank Wakefield, Howard Wandrei, Virgil Finley, Robert F.
Hubbell, George Barrows, Hannes Bok, Audrey Johnson, R. Taylor, and
Gary Gore.

During its first twenty years, Arkham House cancelled publication plans
for certain books. Among these were J. Sheridan LeFanu’s novel, _The
House by the Churchyard_, and the anthology, _The Death Fetch and Other
Gothic Tales_, edited by Stephen Grendon, both of which would have
proved too costly to bring out, and would, on the basis of interest
expressed, have sold far too slowly to warrant publishing. Among these
also were the late Henry Kuttner’s _Mimsy Were the Borogoves_ and C.
L. Moore’s _Shambleau and Other Tales_, which were announced, but not
published because authors and publisher could not agree on contractual
terms. Certain other announced titles--A. E. Van Vogt’s _Away and
Beyond_ and _The World of Null-A_, and Fritz Leiber Jr.’s _Gather,
Darkness!_ and _Conjure Wife_, were released to other publishers who
could do more for them.

Arkham House faces the coming years with confidence. Added to the

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
