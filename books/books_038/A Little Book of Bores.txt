[Illustration: 'A LITTLE BOOK OF BORES']




             A is the Autograph Bore
             Whom Authors and Actors deplore,
                 Tho’ it’s evident quite
                 If the Dears ceased to write
             They’d deplore even more than before.

[Illustration: A]




             B is a Bounder _blasé_
             Who likes to appear quite _au fait_;
               He purses his lips
               As his Rhine wine he sips,
             Tho’ he doesn’t know Hock from Tokay.

[Illustration: B]




             C’s a Critic. Far be it from me
             With a time-honoured craft to make free.
               All praise I accord
               _Good_ Critics—but lord!
             What a Bore a _bad_ Critic can be!

[Illustration: C]




             D is a Decadent Dreary
             Whose Works are depressing and eerie;
               If you ask his excuse
               For existence, or use,
             I’m afraid I can’t answer your query.

[Illustration: D]




             E is the Egotist dread
             Who, as some one has happily said,
               Will talk till he’s blue
               About _my_self, when you
             Want to talk about _your_self instead.

[Illustration: E]




             F’s a Frankly Familiar Friend
             Who loves free advice to extend;
               He declares, for his part,
               He knows nothing of Art,
             But he thinks that your time you misspend.

[Illustration: F]




             G is a Grumbler gruff
             Whom everything puts in a huff;
               If he chances to gain
               Heaven’s gate, he’ll complain
             Of his Halo or Harp, like enough.

[Illustration: G]




             H is a Humorist glum.
             Why sits he so silent and dumb?
               He’s concocting some Gay
               Impromptu to say
             When the Opportune Moment shall come.

[Illustration: H]




             I’s the Intensely Intense
             Who dilates on the _Whither_ and _Whence_,
               The _Ego_ (or “I”),
               And the _Wherefore_ and _Why_,
             Not to mention the _Hither_ and _Hence_.

[Illustration: I]




             J is the “Johnnie”—a Thing
             Much affected by Fairies who sing.
               He is human in shape,
               With the brain of an ape,
             And generally tied to a string.

[Illustration: J]




             K is the Kaiser unnerving,
             With the Terrible Moustache upcurving.
               One man who can bore
               A planet——and more
             Is surely of mention deserving.

[Illustration: K]




             L’s the Loquacious variety,
             That is found in all sorts of society.
               He will drink in the sound
               Of his own voice—till drowned
             In a species of self-inebriety.

[Illustration: L]




             M’s a Methodical Man
             Who prates with precision and plan.
               Beware, how you balk
               The stream of his talk,
             Lest he go back to where he began.

[Illustration: M]




             N is a Newly-rich boor,
             Whom no one pretends to endure.
               Some cases with care
               And complete change of Heir
             Take three generations to cure.

[Illustration: N]




             O is an Optimist glad
             Who doesn’t know how to be sad;
               If he wakes up some day
               In Hades, he’ll say,
             “Well, really it isn’t so bad.”

[Illustration: O]




             P’s a Poetical bore
             Who recites his own things by the score.
               The ladies, poor dears,
               Are all moved to tears,
             While strong men are moved—to the door.

[Illustration: P]




             Q is a Quoter who’ll cite
             His favourite authors all night.
               Tho’ teeming with Thought,
               Like the Moon he is naught
             But a second-hand dealer in Light.

[Illustration: Q]




             R’s a Rampant Reformer whose prose
             Insures you a Health-giving doze.
               You wouldn’t much mind
               If he’d only be kind
             And _not_ slam the door when he goes.

[Illustration: R]




             S is a Satirist rude
             Who subsists on Leguminous Food,
               Which he shyly maintains
               So enforces his brains,
             Even Shakespeare beside him seems crude.

[Illustration: S]




             T is a Terrible Tot
             Who says things he’d much better not.
               A child of that age
               Should be kept in a cage,
             And fed—if at all—through a slot.

[Illustration: T]




             U is the Unco Guid Man,
             And all his unspeakable clan,
               With their _Braw bonnie brae_,
               _Bide a wee, Scots wha hae_,
             _Aweel, Dinna ken_, and _Hoot man_.

[Illustration: U]




             V is a Vain Virtuoso.
             If you ask, “Pray what makes your hair grow so;
               Do you think it a sign
               Of Genius divine?”
             He replies, “I don’t think so, I _know_ so.”

[Illustration: V]




             W’s a Well-informed Wight
             Who aims to set every one right;
               If you chance to misspell
               Or misquote, he will swell
             With holy and chastened Delight.

[Illustration: W]




             X is Old Xmas, a dear
             Old Impostor who comes once a year,
               With wassail, and wishes,
               And death-dealing dishes,
             And chilblains, and chimes, and good cheer.

[Illustration: X]




             Y is a Yodler whose yell
             Wakes the echo in mountain or fell.
               “Poor Echo!” I say,
               “To be wakened each day
             By a sound like a Feline unwell.”

[Illustration: Y]




             Z is a Zealot whose zeal
             Takes the form of an “_Urgent appeal_.”
               Tho’ you wriggle and squirm
               And protest—he sits firm,
             Till he lands you at last like an eel.

    ⁂ Humorous verses and illustrations about Animals.

  _Queen_—“This is one of the most delightfully whimsical collections
  of sketches with both pen and pencil which are always so dear to the
  hearts of children. Mr. Herford’s rhymes are full of that simple fun
  which it requires no effort to appreciate, and many of them are
  irresistibly ridiculous; while his graceful sketches show a high
  sense of genuine humour.”

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
