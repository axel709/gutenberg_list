MANUEL GUERRA TENREIRO JUNIOR


em testimunho de eterna amizade



O.



_O Auctor_.




Meu caro Manuel


Talvez julgasses encontrar aqui uma longa
carta em linguagem empolada, fallando-te de
muita cousa bonita, mas de que tu nada entendesses;
pois estás completamente enganado.

Dir-te-hei sómente que, escrevendo estas poucas
linhas, nada mais intentei, que dar-te uma
prova, ainda que debil, da minha sincera amizade.


Teu do coração

_Abilio Guerra Junqueiro_.




A MINHA MÃE


  Quem me déra voar aonde agora
Me leva o pensamento!
Iria aos braços teus buscar allivio
Á dor que me devora!
Iria juncto a ti viver feliz
Como vivêra outr'ora!




A MEUS MANOS


  Prouvéra a Deus, que eu podesse,
Atravessando os espaços,
Ir fazer-vos mil carinhos,
Cingir-vos em doces laços;

  Cobrir-vos-hia de beijos,
Mitigando a minha dor:
Oh! então mostrar-vos-hia
Quão intenso o meu amor!

  Mas são projectos baldados
Estes que n'um sonho eu vi;
Recebei pois a saudade
Que ora vos mando d'aqui.




Á MORTE DE MINHA PRIMA
D.J. ERNESTINA

Ainsi tombe une fleur avant le temps fanée.
LAMARTINE--_Medit_.


  Ceifou-te a morte no verdor dos annos,
Innocente bonina; e quando então,
Tão candida e tão bella despontavas,
Tão linda e terna como os anjos são!

  Da vida o livro mal aberto tinhas,
Entre os dedos a página da morte,
Sem sentir te apparece de repente:
Assi Deus decretou a tua sorte.

  Os anjos, invejando-te a candura,
D'este arido deserto te hão levado;
Temeram se manchasse um coração
De tamanhas virtudes inspirado!




Á MORTE DO MEU AMIGO
A. P. DE MELLO


  Eu choro, amigo, eu choro ao ver-te assim
Roubado pela morte ao mundo, á vida;
Ai! que transe cruel, que dor sem fim
Soffrendo está minh'alma enternecida!

  Da amizade antes nunca os doces laços
Os nossos corações viesse unir,
Se te havias de ir cedo dos meus braços,
Se tão breve me havias de fugir!

  Antes nunca... que não poderei eu
A ventura sem ti jámais achar!
Perdido o leme e o rumo ao barco seu,
Como é que póde o nauta navegar?...

  Morreste, e nada tenho já commigo!
Esp'ranças, illusões, sonhos ditosos
D'esses meus dias de prazer, de gosos
Voaram todos para Deus comtigo.




A UM AMIGO


  Vivo triste, sempre dado
Ao martyrio, á dor, ao pranto:
A vida, por meu mau fado,
Não tem para mim encanto!

  Nasci p'ra ser desditoso,
P'ra ser feliz não nasci;
Uma esp'rança, um sonho, um gôzo
Nunca n'alma conheci!

  Mas dá-me a tua amizade,
Que, sendo tu meu amigo,
Póde ser que a f'licidade
Venha ainda ter commigo.




NÃO CHORES


  'Stás tão triste, coitadinha,
Ai! fazes-me entristecer;
Nos teus olhos 'stou a ler
Que dor cruel te definha!

  Oh! não chores, que se a vida
Te ha sido tão desditosa,
Outra já bem venturosa
Espera por ti, ó q'rida:

  As tristes pungentes dores
Do teu terno coração,
Lá no ceu se tornarão
Inda n'outras tantas flores!




Houve tempo


  Houve tempo, em que feliz
Vive alegre, ditoso:
Então passava meus dias
Sempre, sempre venturoso;

  Houve tempo, em que este mundo
Julgava sómente ser
Esse espaço, que meus olhos
Podiam só abranger.

  E o tempo destruidor,
Em troca d'essas venturas
E das minhas illusões,
Deu-me só mil amarguras.

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
