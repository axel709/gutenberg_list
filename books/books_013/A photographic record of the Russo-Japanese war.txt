  NICHOLAS II

  EMPEROR OF RUSSIA, WORRIED BY THE WAR
]

The Russo-Japanese War was notable for the fact that, although there
were more men on the spot ready to transmit the news to the world than
there have been in any other war in modern times, there never has been a
war since the days of the telegraph and the professional correspondent
the daily news of which the world at large knew so little. There is,
therefore, a unique interest in so vivid and comprehensive a pictorial
history as that gathered by Collier’s correspondent photographers and
presented in the following pages. Practically all the photographs, with
the exception of a very few of those depicting scenes in Russia’ and
with the Russian forces, were taken originally and exclusively for
Collier’s, and they have not appeared elsewhere except by special
arrangement and permission. A large number of these photographs have
never been printed in Collier’s, and they are published in this book for
the first time. Even these were chosen from many hundreds of others, and
they represent but a small part of the great mass of photographs which
were secured by Collier’s indefatigable representatives at the front. In
each weekly issue of Collier’s it was obviously impossible to devote
more than a few pages exclusively to war pictures, and in such a small
space it is a task of exceeding difficulty to convey to the casual
reader any adequate realization of the unique value and the
comprehensive extent of Collier’s Russo-Japanese War service. In this
book the cumulative effect of many pictures helps to give at least a
partial idea of the amount of material gathered by Collier’s
correspondents, and it should be further explained that almost every one
of the pictures herein reproduced is chosen from perhaps a dozen or
score of photographs of similar scenes.

  MUTSUHITO

  EMPEROR OF JAPAN, WHO BEGAN THE WAR
]

Since the days of the telegraph and the modern war correspondent, there
has never been a war in which the work of the chroniclers was beset with
such difficulties. During the early months of hostilities practically
all of the correspondents were bottled up in Tokio, chafing at their
delay, beseeching this official and that, buying winter outfits only to
be compelled to change them for summer equipment, and wasting their
energies during this fretful period of uncertainty in the description of
conventional phases of Japanese life or of the entertainments given them
by their inscrutable hosts of the Japanese war departments. It was only
by some rare stroke of forehandedness, daring, or luck, by which he
escaped temporarily from the Japanese watchfulness and censorship, that
any correspondent was able at this time to do effective work. Of the
little army of men who tried to chronicle the war, with pencil or
camera, none more really “made good” than Collier’s photographer, James
H. Hare. Mr. Hare worked in Tokio before war was declared, and he
followed Kuroki’s army from its landing in Korea through the Yalu
campaign and until the battle of the Sha-Ho. Mr. Hare is a specialist
not in any sense a “button-pusher,” as he calls the amateur who carries
a camera as an incidental. “When we stood on the heights of Wiju,” wrote
Collier’s correspondent, Frederick Palmer, “the soldiers appeared only
as the veriest specks to a camera lens. Jimmy wanted to see the charge
as much as the rest of us. But the detail had to be shown and the
photographer must be near the detail, so Jimmy slipped away when the
censor wasn’t looking. I wonder if those who saw the realistic pictures
of the groups of wounded around the hospital tents at the Yalu realized
at all what they cost this little man, who is nearing his fiftieth year.
He was the first of the correspondents’ corps to cross the river. He
trudged through miles of sand up to his knees. His pony was worn out;
his weary servant promptly resigned. But Jimmy himself was up the next
morning at daybreak, ill and pale, developing the first photographs of
the army at the front to be published.”

Another of Collier’s photographers, Robert L. Dunn, was sent to Chemulpo
before hostilities broke out and “beat” the newspaper and periodical
world with his pictures of the first battle of the war and the landing
of Japanese troops. The greater portion of the Russian pictures were
taken by Victor K. Bulla, whose work in this country was controlled
exclusively by Collier’s. Dozens of photographs which the reader may
survey at his ease were taken only after long marches over frozen and
wind-swept country. Films were developed in the field with the help of
Korean coolies or Japanese commissary officers, and they reached
Collier’s office only after being carried scores and perhaps hundreds of
miles by coolie runners through a country where a mail service was
unknown. Every one of the photographs printed in this book represents an
outlay of time, energy, and money of which the uninitiated reader can
have only a slight understanding.




                               CHAPTER I
                  THE CAUSES OF THE RUSSO-JAPANESE WAR


The war between Russia and Japan was a fight for disputed territory. Its
immediate cause was the failure of the two nations to agree on the
relation which each should maintain toward Korea and Manchuria. The
underlying cause of the struggle was the mighty clash that was bound to
come when those measures which Japan believed were necessary to her
self-existence met the glacier-like progress of Russia eastward toward
the Pacific. Through nearly three centuries the Russian Empire had
advanced from the Ural Mountains to outposts and outlets on the Pacific
Coast. Her mighty plans met no serious check until they came athwart the
ambitions and policy of the modernized Japan, which saw in this alleged
expansion for industrial development a menace to her integrity as a
kingdom. Korea, a buffer between these two powers, became involved in
the dispute by the results of the war between Japan and China in 1894.
The intervention of the European Powers in the terms of treaty
settlement robbed Japan of her chief spoil, the Liaotung Peninsula,
whose stronghold was Port Arthur. Russia, Germany, and France intimated
that Japanese occupation of this base must be regarded as a permanent
threat to the independence of China and Korea. Three years later, Russia
began to fortify Port Arthur, on the pretext that German acquisition of
Kiaochau would otherwise disturb the balance of power in North China.

The Boxer outbreak of 1900 furnished Russia reasons for vastly
increasing her military strength in Manchuria, to safeguard her railway
across Siberia and her rapidly expanding commercial and colonization
interests. Promises were made, and broken, that Manchuria would be
evacuated and restored to Chinese control as soon as peaceful conditions
were resumed in accordance with the joint agreements of the powers that
the integrity of China should be preserved. When it became certain that
Russia had no intention of loosening her grip on Manchuria, the Japanese
Government proposed a conference, in July of 1903, for the purpose of
assuring the lasting peace of Eastern Asia, by agreeing upon a working
basis for settlement of the points at issue with Russia. Japan wished
guarantees of the territorial integrity of China and Korea, and the
“open door” in both countries for commercial opportunity. Russia replied
that she was ready to recognize the rights of Japan as the predominating
influence in Korea, but refused to discuss further pledges regarding the
future of China and Manchuria. The Russian attitude was influenced most
strongly by the facts that Russia wanted an outlet to the Pacific, and
that the outlay of three hundred million dollars in Manchuria, to make
that province both Russian and prosperous, called for some tangible
return. Japan refused to consider herself outside the sphere of active
interest in Manchuria, and negotiations came to a deadlock early in
1904.

On January 4, Japanese advices said that a conflict with Russia was
inevitable, that the newspapers were urging the opening of hostilities,
and that the Government was massing troops ready to embark on
transports. The diplomats in St. Petersburg were delaying over the final
reply to the Japanese note and were not expecting war, according to
their assurances.

[Illustration:

  TYPICAL STREET SCENE IN RUSSIA’S CAPITAL CITY

  This photograph represents a procession leaving St. Catherine’s
    Church, in St. Petersburg, to
  go down to the Neva to bless the river waters, an example of that
    picturesque mediaevalism
  which survives in so many forms, and as such a real part of the
    everyday life of the people
]

During the following week, Russia was hurrying troops toward the
frontier and buying horses, while the Argentine cruisers, _Nisshin_ and
_Kasuga_, bought by Japan, were making ready to leave Genoa with rush
orders to proceed to Yokohama. Meantime, the negotiations were continued
with proposals and counter-proposals that made no progress.

On January 13, a conference before the Throne in Tokio decided upon the
final terms to be sent to Russia, the only conditions which could avert
war. Russia started two divisions of troops over the Trans-Siberian
Railway to China, an obvious war measure. Two days later two transports
crowded with Russian troops for the Far East sailed through the
Bosphorus. Russia asked Turkey for permission to send the Black Sea
fleet through the Dardanelles, and Lord Lansdowne said that such action
would be considered a breach of treaty in which Great Britain could not
acquiesce.

There was a lull of nearly two weeks, while Tokio fretted over the delay
of the Russian reply. Japan adopted plans for raising seventy-five
million dollars of an emergency war fund.

The long-drawn tension of January ended with a pretence of negotiations
oscillating between Tokio and St. Petersburg, but by this time the
pursuits of diplomacy had become a farce, and both nations were making
all possible preparations for a long struggle at arms. Although the
Russian ultimatum had not been officially delivered, its contents were
forecasted, and it was known that Japan’s final demands had been evaded.
On February 2, the mobilization of the Manchurian reserves was
announced, and on the next day a semi-official despatch from Vladivostok
reported that the Russian squadron there had been stripped for action,
and that the ships in the harbor of Port Arthur had joined those in the
outer roadstead to unite the fighting strength for aggressive action.
The Russian General Staff granted to Alexieff the right to declare war.
Nearly a week before the first blow was struck, it was seen that the
prolonged tension had reached the breaking point. At one of the last
Cabinet conferences in Tokio hope of peace was abandoned, for the reason
that, while Russia was unreasonably delaying her reply to the last
Japanese note, she was daily increasing her warlike activities. It was
known in advance that while Russia partly conceded the demands of Japan
regarding Korea, important reservations were made, and that as regards
Manchuria the reply would refuse to place on record recognition of the
sovereignty of China, or even to discuss that question with Japan.

Japanese residents were told to leave Vladivostok, and 20,000 Russian
troops were moving with the view of occupying Northern Korea. Japan
continued extraordinary preparations for instant action, but the plans
of her army and navy were so carefully guarded that no news of them was
published up to the day war was declared by the first overt act.

    spirit more truly Spartan
  than that manifested by any other nation of the modern world. This
    street, gay with Japanese
  flags, is the “Isezakicho,” which has sometimes been called the Bowery
    of Yokohama
]

On Saturday, February 6, the Russian note was already in the hands of
Baron de Rosen, the Russian Minister at Tokio, for delivery to Baron
Komura, the Japanese Foreign Minister, when at four o’clock in the
afternoon, M. Kurino, the Japanese Minister at St. Petersburg, called
personally to inform the Russian Government that, in view of the delays
in connection with the Russian replies, and the obvious futility of the
negotiations, Japan considered it useless to continue diplomatic
relations. Japan would take such steps as she deemed proper for the
protection of her interests, therefore M. Kurino asked for his
passports. The Russian Minister, a few hours later, prepared to leave
Tokio as soon as possible.

The startling action of Japan, in severing diplomatic relations before
the actual delivery of the Russian note, came like a bolt from a clear
sky at St. Petersburg. It was expected that Japan would invade Korea and
seek a naval battle within the next twenty-four hours. This was an
accurate surmise, for in even less time forty Japanese transports were
loaded with troops to be landed at various points in Southern and
Central Korea. One naval division sailed from Japanese waters for
Chemulpo, and another for Port Arthur, as soon as the news that there
could be no peace was sent by wireless telegraphy to the waiting ships.

In the afternoon of February 8 a fleet of Japanese transports, escorted
by a squadron of battleships and powerful cruisers, appeared off the
harbor of Chemulpo. The Russian gunboat _Korietz_, on its way to Port
Arthur with despatches, sighted the hostile craft; the commander cleared
for action, fired a shot at the Japanese torpedo scouts, then returned
at full speed to shelter near the Russian cruiser _Variag_, inside the
Korean harbor. This proved to be the first shot of the war, and was so
claimed by the Japanese when accused of attacking Port Arthur without
formal declaration of war later in the same day. Early on the morning of
February 9, Admiral Uriu, commander of the Japanese fleet, notified the
two Russians that they must surrender or leave the harbor by noon, else
he would attack them where they lay. The Russians did not surrender, but
sailed out of the bay, with bands playing, to certain destruction. By
four o’clock that afternoon the _Variag_ and the _Korietz_ were at the
bottom of Chemulpo Harbor, and the war was on.

The man who judges things by weight, bulk, and dollars may well wonder
at Japanese temerity. To Japan, with her 147,000 square miles, the
annexation of Korea, with 82,000 square miles, meant what the annexation
of Mexico would to the United States. To Russia, with her 8,666,000
square miles, it meant less than Southern California to us. Russia’s
population was 140,000,000; Japan’s 44,000,000. On a peace footing the
Russian army had 1,000,000 officers and men; the Japanese, 175,000. On a
war footing, the Russian 4,600,000 and the Japanese 675,000.

Russia is the Christian nation which has been slowest in development.
Mentally, she is just out of the Dark Ages, equipped with the mechanical
progress of modern times. Japan is the pagan nation which has been
foremost in adopting the worldly essentials of a civilization which is
Christian in its origin. Russia is a union of nomadic races, but lately
ushered into feudalism, which have, in turn, conquered many other races.
Japan has had a stable, organized government longer than England, and
the Japanese were a free people when the Saxons were the serfs of the
Normans. The Czar is a pope; the Mikado divinity itself. If the Jews
were still a nation and a descendant of Moses were their king, he would
mean to them what the Mikado means to the Japanese. For all the
centuries of the nation’s existence the Japanese had known no
acquisition of territory. The Russians have lived by this.

These photographs were taken on the parade ground at the Oyama Barracks
in Tokio just before the outbreak of the war. Japan had already been
practically on a war footing for months, and the busy work of
preparation here suggested was typical of the spirit that prevailed
throughout the nation and brought Japan’s army to a state of
preparedness perhaps never before duplicated in the history of war.

The Japanese cavalry was the weakest branch of the service. The Japanese
are not natural horsemen, and both the men and their mounts were
inferior, in a military sense, to the other branches of the service. The
horses were scrubby little beasts with neither speed nor tractability.
The trooper whose mount finally succeeded in clearing the bar shown
above thought the feat very remarkable

In spite of his inscrutable manner the Japanese soldier when with a
crowd of his comrades becomes almost as loquacious as the typical
regular of other countries. In the Oyama Barracks, where this photograph
was taken, a large number of troops were quartered ready to be rushed to
the front as soon as hostilities were declared

cavalry horses were injured during their railroad journey by kicking
each other or their stalls. The light “collapsable” carts shown here
were one of the features of the mobile Japanese equipment. They kept
pace with the marching column

It was not until the troops had been departing from Tokio for several
days that the general populace showed any such resemblance to Occidental
enthusiasm as this. When some of the members of the staff left Tokio,
they awakened and behaved like any other crowd at such a time. They
shouted good-bys and the band, in a quaint imitation of Western customs,
played “Auld Lang Syne”

The bridges used at the Yalu were all planned and constructed in
practice in Japan long before war was declared. After being built they
were taken apart, carried along with the rest of the equipment, and put
together when the time came. The Japanese engineers had complete maps
and measurements of the streams in Manchuria, so that they always knew
just what difficulties were to be met

Enthusiasm at Kobe upon the departure of a troop train for Ugina, a port
of embarkation for Korea. On leaving for the front the Japanese soldier
suppressed all emotions of sorrow. Not to be impassive was unmanly. It
was only at such times as this that the collective enthusiasm showed
itself, and it was not until a number of trains had passed en route for
the front that it awoke.




                               CHAPTER II
                      THE FIRST BATTLES OF THE WAR


It was on the night of February 8, 1904, that all hope of a peaceful
solution of the Russo-Japanese entanglement was blown to the winds by
the startling attack of Admiral Togo’s torpedo-boats on the Russian
fleet at Port Arthur. The Russians were quite unready for so swift an
onslaught; many officers were on shore, while the lookouts and scouting
service were scarcely more vigilant than in time of peace. The Japanese
torpedo flotilla sped in among the close-huddled battleships, launched
their missiles, and were scurrying to sea before the Russian crews began
to repel the attack. The first-class battleships “Retvizan” and
“Czarevitch” and the cruiser “Pallada” were so badly injured that they
had to be beached. The Japanese fleet returned the next day and
bombarded the Russian ships and forts. In this attack the battleship
“Poltava,” and the cruisers “Diana,” “Novik,” and “Askold” were
temporarily disabled.

Before the news of the battle of Port Arthur had fairly reached the eyes
of the Western world came the more tragic story of the destruction of
the “Variag” and the “Korietz” in Chemulpo Harbor. Admiral Uriu,
commanding six Japanese battleships, six cruisers, and twelve torpedo
craft, appeared off Chemulpo and demanded the surrender of the two
Russian ships. Captain Behr of the “Variag” and Captain Roudnoff of the
“Korietz” refused to surrender, and on the morning of February 9, the
“Variag,” with bands playing, steamed out of the harbor to meet the
hopeless odds. She met the Japanese fleet eight miles out, the enemy
using long-range 12-inch guns, and pounding away at distances which made
the “Variag’s” batteries harmless. Ten large projectiles riddled the
cruiser, and in fifty minutes not a gun could be worked, the ship was on
fire, engines crippled, and 109 officers and men of a complement of 540
lay dead and wounded on the decks. The “Variag” crept back into port,
her crew was removed to the British cruiser “Talbot” and the French
cruiser “Pascal,” and she was set on fire. Three hours later, the
“Variag,” after only eighteen months’ service, was at the bottom, a
shattered and blackened mass of steel. The “Korietz” was a slow gunboat
of only 1,200 tons, mounting one 6-inch gun and two 8-inch guns, with no
armor protection. She was untouched, but after the fight her commander
decided to destroy his ship, because Admiral Uriu had promised to renew
the attack at four in the afternoon. Precisely at four o’clock, two
deafening explosions came from the “Korietz.” As the smoke cleared,
where the “Korietz” had been, only bits of wreckage and about four feet
of her funnel could be seen.

On the day after the Russian ships had been destroyed a division of the
Japanese army was thrown ashore at Chemulpo. The landing was made in
perfect order. The army was dependent for nothing upon the port. A large
force was sent to occupy Seoul, and within two days Japan was in
complete control of the most advantageous strategic bases of Korea.

world had of the wonderful preparedness of the soldiers of the Mikado.
In spite of the darkness, fitfully punctuated by blazing torches, fires,
and braziers, the task went on like clockwork

As soon as the Japanese landed after the battle between the warships in
Chemulpo Harbor, a hospital was improvised and the more dangerously
wounded Russians brought ashore from the foreign battleships, where they
had been cared for temporarily, and nursed by the Japanese Red Cross
service. As a mark of appreciation Russia contributed 2,000 yen ($1,000)
to the Japanese branch of the Red Cross]




                              CHAPTER III
                      RUSSIAN PREPARATIONS FOR WAR


Not only were the available Russian forces ill prepared for meeting the
agile and ready Japanese, not only was their equipment ponderous and
unwieldy, their knowledge of the strategic difficulties and advantages
of the country in which the fighting was to be done scant and
inaccurate, but the big fact which put Russia at a disadvantage during
the early months of the war was the immense distance between her
military bases and the front. Across the trackless wastes of Siberia the
only path was a single-track railroad—a line of communication none too
well equipped in times of peace, and open to complete and immediate
disablement should the enemy succeed in cutting it at any point along a
comparatively vulnerable stretch of many hundreds of miles. By sea—that
is to say, by the way of the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, and the
route round the southern coast of Asia—Russian ships and soldiers were
over 12,000 miles, or about fifty-one days, away from the seat of
hostilities. When to these material difficulties were added the
dissensions, jealousies, and shifting policies of St. Petersburg, the
effective strength of Russia in these early days of the war could in no
way be measured by her vast extent and apparently illimitable power.

In Japan, on the other hand, preparedness was the keynote of the
situation. Although nominally at peace, Japan had been practically on a
war footing for months, yet so secretly was this preparation made that
even after war was declared a casual and incurious visitor in Tokio
would have seen little to indicate that he was in one of the great
military centres of the world, and that all round and about him was
being planned one of the greatest struggles of modern times.

The results of this preparedness were vividly enough shown when the
“Variag” and the “Korietz” were sunk in Chemulpo Harbor, before the
world was really aware that war was seriously intended and inevitable.
They were no less convincingly demonstrated by the perfection of the
Japanese field equipment, and by the almost microscopic exactness with
which every possible contingency had been foreseen and provided for.
Ever since their war with China the Japanese had been perfecting their
military organization, as though the coming war with Russia were a
certainty. They had military maps of every nook and corner of Korea and
Manchuria; they had spies working as coolies on the Russian railroads,
and in Russian ports and shipyards; they had their light equipment
especially adapted for the heavy Manchurian roads. Their baggage was so
arranged and distributed that it made compact cube-shaped bundles which
could be packed like so many building blocks, or made into easily
carried packs for coolies. The collapsable boats with which a pontoon
bridge was thrown across the Yalu were made for that special purpose
months before, when the Korean peninsula was yet to be invaded. In fact,
the whole early part of the war was an almost grotesque struggle between
preparedness and unpreparedness, extreme mobility and clodhopping
heaviness, cleverness and stupidity.

Empress presided over another sewing circle

                               CHAPTER IV
                       WITH THE JAPANESE IN KOREA


Having secured a safe landing-place at Chemulpo, Japan poured troops
into Korea and along the old Peking Road through Seoul to Ping-Yang and
on to the northward toward the Yalu. Russia abandoned all hope of
effective aggression by sea with her crippled fleet, and, except for the
elusive Vladivostok squadron of four powerful cruisers, Japan was free
to rush her troops into Korea. Russia bent all her energies toward
hurrying her levies and supplies into Manchuria. Seoul was occupied and
the Russian minister invited to leave. He complied at once.

Moving at the rapid pace of from fifteen to twenty-five miles a day, the
mobile Japanese pushed on to Ping-Yang. No opposition was met with, the
native Koreans staring dumbly at the invaders without much curiosity and
with no desire to make resistance. The march from Seoul to Ping-Yang was
made along the ancient road to Peking, which was a quagmire most of the
distance, crowded with cavalry, infantry, pack-trains, bullock-carts,
and long trains of white-clad natives burdened with bags of provisions,
plodding knee-deep through slush and mud. Half-frozen at night,
stumbling and slipping all day, each soldier carrying sixty pounds of
equipment, this infantry column swept along at a speed of from fifteen
to twenty-five miles a day. That such speed was possible was due to the
lightness of the Japanese baggage and wagon equipment, which had been
specially prepared for the heavy Korean and Manchurian roads.

It was apparent even to casual observers that immense military
operations were under way, yet the civilized world was wholly in
ignorance of their scope or direction. On February 15, for example,
scores of crowded transports were leaving the Japanese naval bases, and
a small army of alert correspondents from the world over could only
guess whether these thousands of troops were going to Korea, to the Yalu
region, or within a hundred miles of the Liaotung Peninsula. While the
Japanese troops were pushing northward, the advance guard of the Russian
army crossed the Yalu into Korean territory and occupied Wiju. The
Russian headquarters were established at Harbin, the chief strategic
centre of railway communication in inland Manchuria.

Chenampo is one hundred and thirty miles north of Chemulpo on Korea Bay,
and correspondingly nearer to the Yalu. Early in April, after the troops
which had landed at Chemulpo two months before had completed their
arduous march northward through the Korean Peninsula, and had captured
the town of Wiju, on the east bank of the Yalu River, what was known as
the main army, under General Kuroki, landed from transports at Chenampo.
The success of the advance column had given the Japanese control of the
mouth of the Yalu before Kuroki began to mobilize his co-operating
columns, and two forces were thus ready by the end of April to force the
passage of the Yalu and fight their way into Manchuria.

[Illustration:

The Japanese troops were ferried from the transports to the shore at
Chenampo in heavy, blunt-nosed sampans. These sampans are sculled from
the stern ordinarily with huge sweeps. The boatmen can be seen over the
heads of the seated soldiers, standing over their sweeps like
gondoliers. At Chenampo the sampans were in most cases lashed together
in groups of three or four and towed by tugs

General Kuroki not only misled the Russians as to the point at which he
would probably cross the Yalu, but masked the march of his forces to the
point north of the Wiju, where the crossing was made, by these grass
screens and by marching behind hills. The Russians knew that some
movement was going on, but could not make out the extent of it

Russian scholar of the staff. One of Kuroki’s absolute prohibitions to
correspondents was the mention either of the general’s name or of the
place from which they wrote, lest news of the army’s location should be
brought to the Russians




                               CHAPTER V
                    THE RUSSIAN ADVANCE TO THE FRONT


The supreme difficulty under which Russia labored during the early
months of the war was the enormous distance from her military base to
the battle front. The only line of land communication between Russia and
Manchuria was the single-track Siberian railroad, and when war began
this line was broken by the ice-locked Lake Baikal. Russia had need of
300,000 men in Manchuria as soon as they could be rushed there, and with
Lake Baikal frozen to the depth of nine feet, less than four thousand
and more often not more than one thousand men could cross it in a day.

Lake Baikal, this weakest link of a very weak chain, is the largest body
of fresh water in the Old World, except the Victoria Nyanza in Africa.
It is nearly 15,000 square miles in extent, and therefore inferior only
to Superior and Huron among the great American lakes. It is 600 versts
long, with a width varying from 27 to 85 versts. It is 3,185 feet deep.
The railroad was broken by the southern end of this lake, where it is
about 40 miles wide. This is the gap that disastrously impairs the
utility of the Trans-Siberian for the moving of troops and war supplies
to the Manchurian and Korean frontier.

The lake begins to freeze in November, is completely ice-bound by the
middle of December, remaining so for five months. The ice freezes to a
thickness of nine feet, which would make sledge traffic perfect, were it
not for the fact that wide fissures break its surface, which have a way
of frequently closing up and piling the ice high into impassable
windrows. These crevices have a width of three to six feet, and are
often more than a verst in length, forming a serious impediment to
progress on the ice and rendering next to impossible the marching of
troops across the lake or the safe sledging of supplies. A thunderous
crash, as of an explosion, marks the forming of the crevice, followed by
a long, rolling reverberation. The rift instantly fills with water to
the level of the ice, and is so agitated at the surface by currents or
other forces that eight to fourteen days are required for it to freeze
over, when the operation of cracking begins anew, and is repeated
throughout the coldest portion of the winter.

The obvious solution to this difficulty was to build a railroad round
the end of the lake, a detour of nearly 150 miles, and necessitating the
construction of four tunnels. This was out of the question. A powerful
ice-crusher, the “Baikal,” modeled after the ice-crushers successfully
used in the Straits of Mackinac, had been built. She could break ice
four feet thick, but on the nine-foot ice of the Russian inland sea she
made no successful impression. The result was that a line of track had
to be laid across the lake, and that before this was completed the
troops had to be marched across the forty-mile stretch of wind-swept
ice, while their supplies and baggage had to be dragged after them in
sledges. Many of the men, wandering on to treacherous ice, were drowned;
many were frost-bitten, and all suffered extremely from the arduous
labor of the march and the bitter cold.

                               CHAPTER VI
            THE BATTLE OF THE YALU AND THE JAPANESE ADVANCE


The battle of the Yalu was the first great land action of the
Russo-Japanese War. The Russians were outnumbered by their opponents,
but they were also outwitted and outmanœuvred, and the result was an
overwhelming victory for the Japanese. In the crossing of the Yalu the
Japanese exhibited the decided superiority of their shell-fire, they
accomplished the brilliant strategic feat of crossing a river in the
face of an intrenched enemy, and their commander, General Kuroki, proved
himself a tactician of the first rank.

The first triumph of Japanese cleverness was in deceiving the enemy as
to the probable place of crossing. Bridge materials were brought to the
shore below Wiju and preparations were apparently made for building a
bridge at that point. Under cover of night most of these materials were
rushed to the north of Wiju and above the extreme left of the Russian
line. From this position the main body of the Japanese army crossed to
the Manchurian side with comparatively little opposition. On the Russian
left (up the river) the bank rose in a precipitous rocky formation to a
height of a thousand feet. At the base was a path and a line of sand
left by the falling current. Stretching along this for a mile or more,
like so many blue pencil marks on brown paper, were the Japanese. Any
Russians above them could have done more damage with tumbling bowlders
than with rifle fire. Once on this, the Japanese were under a shelf.
They could be reached only by shooting straight down the stream, and had
gun or rifle ventured this the Russians would have found no cover save
the smoke of shrapnel from the batteries which would have sent them
back. The crossing of the Yalu was effected by a few rounds of
musket-fire. The impregnable position of the enemy became cover for the
Japanese advance.

Once on the western bank and far enough north of the Russian line to be
safe from attack on his own right flank, Kuroki’s plan was to execute a
series of flank movements and attacks from the rear which would drive
the Russians from their position and render what slight fortifications
they had made on the heights along the river valueless. In spite of the
reckless bravery of the Russians and the stubbornness of their defence,
the impetus of the Japanese attack and the marvelous speed and
effectiveness of the Japanese shell-fire could not be withstood, and the
Russians were routed all along the line. They made a last stand at
Hamatan Hill, a few miles to the rear of their original position, but
the Japanese surrounded them on three sides and before the force
retreated nearly four hundred men were compelled to surrender. Of the
Japanese forces, 5 officers and 160 men were killed, while 29 officers
and 666 men were wounded. The Russian dead, buried by the Japanese,
numbered nearly 1,400, and 475 wounded Russians were taken to Japanese
hospitals. Probably 500 wounded Russians, at least, escaped with the
retreating army. The Japanese captured 28 guns, 50 ammunition wagons,
and many other munitions of war.

The fence behind which these reserves are standing was one of those with
which the Japanese concealed their march, from the point south of Wiju
where they first made a feint at crossing to the point north of the town
where the brilliant crossing was finally made. The impetus of this final
attack was such that the Russians were soon routed all along the line.

The care of the Russian wounded by the Japanese after the Yalu battle,
and the burial of several Russian officers with military honors, were
things which surprised many sceptical observers of Japanese
civilization, who had predicted that, once in hand-to-hand conflict with
the enemy, the veneer of European civilization would quickly drop off
and reveal the barbarian

This temple was the scene of two severe fights between the advancing
Japanese and the Russians, in which the Russians were routed and driven
back. The temple was built by the Chinese after their last war with
Japan because they thought that the gods of another temple had prevented
the Japanese from taking the pass. The gods and the Russians together
could not stop the enemy this time.

                              CHAPTER VII
                   BEGINNING THE SIEGE OF PORT ARTHUR


As soon as the Japanese learned of Kuroki’s success at the Yalu, they
hurried troops ashore at Takushan and Pitsewo, on the eastern shore of
the Liaotung Peninsula north of Port Arthur. This was on May 5. The
landing was quite unexpected by the Russians; there was no sufficient
force to attempt any resistance, and in three days an army was marching
southward to begin the closing-in movement that ended in the fall of
Russia’s supposedly impregnable fortress. On May 26, after fighting in
and about Kinchow for nine days, Nanshan Hill, on the narrow isthmus
joining the Port Arthur Peninsula to the main part of the Liaotung
Peninsula, was captured by assault. Every device of modern warfare—the
railway, telegraph, telephones, a captive balloon, mine-fields, barbed
wire network, iron-roofed trenches, searchlights, illuminating
star-shells—was used at Nanshan Hill to increase the natural strength of
the fort. The ranges were known and the approach was from but one
direction. There had been three months and a half since the war began
and three weeks since the landing at Pitsewo. If Russian troops could be
driven from such a position, and under such circumstances, by the
Japanese, it seemed perfectly certain that no fortifications that Russia
could devise could withstand the enemy. One last and unsuccessful
attempt was made to cut the Japanese off before it was too late. The
Russian army at Tashichao, under General Stakelberg, made a sortie
southward and met General Oku’s army on June 14 at Wafengtien. The
Russians were completely defeated. The Liaotung Peninsula was then open
to the Japanese, and as soon as General Nogi and his army arrived to
hold it and to begin to close in on Port Arthur, Oku was free to wheel
north, and to co-operate with the armies of Kuroki and Nodzu in the
general movement toward Liao-Yang. By the middle of June parallel
columns of Japanese were moving northward through the valleys of
Manchuria like so many fingers of one giant hand.

Meanwhile Admiral Togo had maintained a strict blockade of the harbor
and the Russian fleet had been practically destroyed. Beginning with the
destruction of the “Variag” and “Korietz” in February, and including the
tragic sinking of the “Petropavlovsk,” and the death of Admiral Makaroff
and the painter Verestchagin on April 13, the Japanese successes
gradually wore down the Port Arthur fleet until the Russian naval power
in the East was no longer a factor in the reckoning. Up until the end of
April the Japanese losses were practically nothing at all. Then came the
sinking, by submarine mines, of the battleship “Hatsuse,” the third
class cruiser “Miyako,” and Torpedo Boat No. 48. The battleship
“Yoshino” was sunk in a collision. These losses came too late, however,
for the Russians to take advantage of them, and the death of Admiral
Makaroff may be said to mark the climax of the naval campaign against
Port Arthur. After that the land campaign against the “Gibraltar of the
East” began in earnest.

                              CHAPTER VIII
            EARLY CAMPAIGNING BEFORE THE BATTLE OF LIAO-YANG


With Port Arthur cut off from the north, the three Japanese armies
pushed rapidly northward in a general closing-in movement on Liao-Yang.
General Nodzu’s army on June 26 captured Fengshuiling, on the main road
northward from Takushan to Newchwang, and the Russian forces began to
fall steadily back. At the same time, Kuroki, on the north, was
capturing two passes of even greater importance, Motienling and Taling,
and Oku, to the southward, was driving the Russians back with similar
success. On July 17 the Russians, under General Count Keller, did make a
desperate effort to retake Motienling, but were repulsed with heavy
loss. Keller made another attempt to force the Japanese back a fortnight
later, but it was equally disastrous and the general himself was killed.
Meanwhile, on July 22 and 23, General Oku, on the extreme south and west
of the long Japanese front, closed in upon Tashichao, and, with the
assistance of Nodzu’s army, which had pushed up from Fengshuiling,
captured the town and compelled the 40,000 Russians there to retreat.
This, together with the unsuccessful battle in which Keller was killed,
was practically the last of the Russians’ attempts to make a forward
movement. General Kuropatkin devoted himself to preparing for a decisive
battle at Liao-Yang, meanwhile keeping up all along the line just enough
resistance to delay and hamper the Japanese advance.

At the outset of the war Russia had in Manchuria about 45,700 men and
120 field guns. Of this force about 20,000 men were at Port Arthur,
4,400 at Talienwan, 1,400 at Yinkow, 1,150 at Haicheng, 1,900 at
Liao-Yang, 2,750 at Tieling, north of Mukden, 1,250 at Ninguta in
northeast Manchuria, 4,550 at Harbin, 1,950 at Tsitsihar in northwest
Manchuria, and the rest in the smaller garrisons scattered through the
territory from northeast Manchuria to Port Arthur. In addition there was
a separate organization of railway patrol troops stationed in small
bodies at many points on and near the railway. On January 1, 1904, the
number of these railway troops was estimated at 15,200 with 32 guns, so
that the grand total at the beginning of the war was about 60,000 men
with about 150 field guns. In spite of the pressure on the Siberian
Railroad and the hard marches cross Lake Baikal in the winter, Russia
soon found that, however many millions she might have in Europe, she
could not maintain in the field, at the end of 6,000 miles of single
track, more than 300,000 troops, and keep them fully supplied with food,
ammunition, and fresh men to take the place of the killed, wounded, and
sick.

During all this campaigning in Manchuria the Japanese showed the same
preparedness and mobility which had been so strikingly characteristic of
them during the earlier months of the war. They knew at all times the
strength of their enemy as well as they knew the country, and to the
information gathered by their spies and outposts was added that supplied
by a generally friendly native population.

                               CHAPTER IX
                        THE BATTLE OF LIAO-YANG


The battle of Liao-Yang was the culminating event of the four months’
Manchurian campaign which the Japanese began when they crossed the Yalu.
In the point of number of men engaged it was the greatest battle of
modern times, and it resulted in a decisive, though hard-won, victory
for the Japanese. Between 400,000 and half a million men fought in the
two armies, and when the five days’ duel was over the total losses in
killed and wounded were estimated at about 30,000. The result of the
battle was that the Japanese gained complete control of the Liaotung
Peninsula, north of Port Arthur, and that the Russian army was forced to
retreat northward toward Mukden and Harbin.

The Russians under General Kuropatkin had collected a large amount of
ammunition and supplies at Liao-Yang and the town itself was elaborately
fortified. It was generally understood that General Kuropatkin’s plan
was to lure the Japanese on to the plain in front of Liao-Yang and there
to meet them in decisive battle. When the battle proper began on August
26, the Russian army occupied three groups of positions, extending in a
semicircle in front of and to the southward of the fortifications of the
town. Kuroki’s army on the east, Nodzu’s on the south, and Oku’s on the
west—the whole under the command of Field Marshal Oyama—attacked along
the whole front. After five days of the most persistent attack and
defence, and a terrific and almost continuous artillery duel, during
which the Russians were pushed back into Liao-Yang, General Kuroki
succeeded in throwing a considerable force across the Taitse River,
which extends eastward and westward just north of the town. With his
left flank and rear thus menaced, Kuropatkin was compelled, on September
1, to evacuate Liao-Yang and retreat on Mukden.

With the loss of Liao-Yang crumbled to pieces the plan for the defence
of Manchuria which the Russian commanders had adopted when they were
preparing for war with Japan. With the exception of the beleaguered
garrison at Port Arthur, Russia had lost every foothold on the Liaotung
Peninsula. In only one thing were the Japanese unsuccessful. They had
failed to get to the rear of the Russian army and to cut off Kuropatkin
from his line of retreat, and the manner in which the Russian commander
withdrew his army in the face of almost insurmountable difficulties went
far to mitigate the humiliation of defeat. The estimates of the number
of troops engaged on either side vary from somewhat less than 200,000 to
250,000 men. It was generally believed at the time the battle was fought
that the Japanese outnumbered the Russians, but inasmuch as they were
attacking an intrenched force this advantage was apparent rather than
real. No battle in our Civil War was on as large a scale as that at
Liao-Yang. The battle of Leipsic, where Napoleon arrayed 130,000 men
against the 300,000 of the Allies, was, in point of number of men
engaged, the greatest previous battle of modern times.

                               CHAPTER X
                       THE CHRONICLERS OF THE WAR


The most interesting stories written by the correspondents who were sent
to cover the Russo-Japanese War were probably the ones that never passed
the censor, the most extraordinary sights those which the correspondents
did not see. There has never been a struggle since the days of the
telegraph and the professional correspondent of which the world at large
knew so little. During the early months of the war practically all of
the correspondents were bottled up in Tokio, and when at last a few of
them were released and allowed to follow the army, they were kept far in
the rear, and were only permitted to see the fighting at the Yalu from
the top of a hill several miles from the firing line.

Marking time in Tokio for months were newspaper men and special writers
who were correspondent veterans of many wars, and who were compelled to
waste their energies in the description of tea-houses, theatres, and
other conventional show places. The unfortunate correspondents were
repeatedly told that they were soon to leave for the front, only to
learn presently that there was to be more delay, and to see a repetition
of the Japanese smile, and hear again the Japanese “I’m so very, very
sorry.”

R. L. Dunn, Collier’s special photographer, who was fortunate enough to
get into Korea before the rigid censorship of correspondents began, but
was subsequently forced to return, thus described some of the distresses
of the luckless who were held up in Tokio: “I found more than a hundred
war correspondents at Tokio, hustling from morning to night in order to
get ready in time, and buying a thousand odd things at war prices, so
that their equipments might meet every conceivable emergency. That was
in April. Spring changed into summer. Fur-lined sleeping bags and
firepots made the days seem hotter than they were. The whole winter
outfit had to be exchanged for one suited to summer. On June 1
everything was as it had been at the beginning, except that some
correspondents were contemplating the necessity of acquiring a third
outfit for the rainy season.”

“Never was parting guest more happy to get away,” wrote Collier’s
special correspondent, Frederick Palmer, when he and J. H. Hare,
Collier’s special photographer, at last left Tokio with three other
Americans—the first to be allowed to go to the front; “never was parting
guest more heartily and sincerely sped. With the correspondents of the
first contingent actually going, the hopes of the second and the third
rose to the dignity of expectations. They gathered at Shimbashi Station
with tin horns and gave the chosen few an Anglo-Saxon cheer. For over
two months some of us have waited for official passes to join the
Japanese army in the field. Now that we have the treasure it is not much
to look at—only a slip of paper which would go into the average sized
envelope. By rights, it should be on vellum, with marginal decorations
of storks standing on one leg and an inscription of _summa cum laude_
for patience in flourishes.”

                               CHAPTER XI
                     THE FIGHTING ALONG THE SHA-HO


The Japanese armies occupied Liao-Yang on September 4, and on September
8 the Russians announced that their entire forces had safely reached
Mukden. For a fortnight or so the two vast armies paused for breath,
while far to the southward the bombardment of Port Arthur continued, and
thousands of miles to the westward Russia’s Baltic fleet sailed from
Kronstadt for the Far East. During the latter part of September there
was desultory fighting along a considerable battle front, and when
General Gripenberg took command of the second Russian army in Manchuria,
General Kuropatkin began, the first week in October, an offensive
movement against his conquerors.

Whether this advance was his own idea or whether it was prematurely
ordered from St. Petersburg was not positively known, but it began with
an oratorical proclamation to the army that the time had come for Russia
to take the initiative and force Japan to do her bidding. Kuropatkin’s
force numbered nearly 300,000 men, his artillery was said to be superior
to the Japanese, and it was plain that the fight was to be on as vast if
not a vaster scale than that at Liao-Yang. For a time there were a few
slight Russian successes, and after sharp fighting Kuropatkin succeeded
in capturing Bentziaputze, about half-way between Liao-Yang and Mukden
and on the Japanese right. The offensive movement was directed along the
whole Japanese line, extending about thirty miles from Bentziaputze
westward to the Sha-Ho. For nearly a fortnight fierce fighting
continued, a test of endurance on both sides, until the Russians were
finally obliged to retreat, leaving behind many guns and having lost, it
was estimated, some sixty thousand men. The Japanese losses were about
twenty thousand. Desultory engagements continued through October and
November, in the midst of heavy rains, until the cold set in in earnest,
and both armies went into winter quarters.

In zero weather the two armies faced each other, burrowing underground
in their dugouts, in many places so close to each other that the
sentries could almost call one to another. The time was spent in target
practice, in chopping up wood to be used for building and for making
charcoal, and in drilling the recruits who were sent up to refill the
shattered regiments. The quarters in which the armies found shelter were
dugouts roofed over with logs, kowliang, and earth. That same attention
to detail which was characteristic of the Japanese army during the
campaign was as noticeable now that they were idle. There were even hot
baths for the soldiers. Earthenware jars were sunk in the ground much
like the Russian soup kettles. Water was heated in these and baths could
be taken as in so many vertical bathtubs. During the lull in the
fighting there was a celebration in honor of the successes on the Sha-Ho
at which there was a target-shoot between the military attaches.
Meanwhile the Baltic fleet was pursuing its slow journey to the Orient,
and the army of General Nogi was closing-in on Port Arthur.

                              CHAPTER XII
                        THE FALL OF PORT ARTHUR


The first day of January, 1905, witnessed the end of the gigantic siege
that had furnished a tragic background for eleven of the twelve months
of 1904. The first blow struck by the Japanese in the war was aimed at
Port Arthur, and during the month that followed they and the defenders
employed and endured more terrific forces of destruction than were ever
used at any other siege in the history of the world. The fall of this
Gibraltar of the East seemed to prove that there can be no such thing as
an impregnable fortress. The attack on Port Arthur began with Togo’s
dash against the Russian fleet on the night of February 8. Four months
later, through the successes of the Japanese on the Liaotung peninsula,
the fortress had been cut off from all outside help.

From the outer line of defence at Nanshan, and thirty miles from the
town, the Japanese worked their way literally inch by inch, burrowing
underground, digging deep trenches that zig-zagged toward the enemy’s
lines, until near enough to make a rush. In many places the ground was
solid rock and countermining was impossible. Barbed-wire entanglements
covered the country for miles, and wide stretches of bare ground had
been covered a foot deep with powdered white ash, which stirred into a
thick white cloud when trodden on, so as to make a splendid target for
machine guns. There were buried mines, some to explode automatically,
others to explode when the lookout man in a distant fort pressed a
button. At night searchlights flashed across every yard of the country
near the lines of forts, and sometimes the Russian gunboats creeping
along the shore outside the harbor got far enough to pour a cross-fire
into the Japanese encampments. Day and night Togo’s squadron sent in
from long range the terrible Shimose shells, worse than lyddite, on the
battered town and forts. Where it was impossible to tunnel or burrow,
masses of rock and bags full of sand were rushed forward at night to
make a temporary shelter where a regiment could go forward a hundred
yards, rest, fire for a few minutes, and advance another hundred yards,
until at last they were close to the enemy. Then, in the teeth of fierce
rifle fire, reinforced, perhaps, by shells from the other forts, the
final charge was made.

The last stage of the advance began on November 30 with the capture of
203-Metre Hill. From this hill the Japanese were able for the first time
to get the range of the Russian ships in the harbor. All the larger
vessels of the Russian fleet were soon disabled. The great Keekwan
Mountain fort was captured on December 18, and on the 30th Ehrlung Fort,
the key of the inner defences, was stormed. That day and the next the
Japanese captured half a dozen neighboring positions, and finally, on
January 1, General Stoessel, who had said at the beginning of the siege
that Port Arthur would be his tomb, sent a message to General Nogi
offering to surrender. For a second time Port Arthur passed into the
hands of those from whom the European powers had wrested it ten years
before.

                              CHAPTER XIII
                          THE BATTLE OF MUKDEN


Judged by the number of men engaged, the vast extent of the battlefield,
and the losses, the battle of Mukden was the greatest of modern times,
if not of all history. Even the tremendous duel at Liao-Yang, which was
on a larger scale than any modern battle that had preceded it, pales
before this nineteen days’ struggle. Between 750,000 and 800,000 men
were engaged, of which about 361,000 were Russian and at least 400,000
Japanese. When the nineteen days’ struggle began, both sides faced each
other in the valley of the Sha River, the Russian lines stretching back
upon tiers of defences, backed up with over 1,300 guns and forming south
of Mukden a barrier which foreign experts pronounced impregnable.

From east to west the five Japanese armies were assigned under the
following commanders—Kawamura, Kuroki, Nodzu, Oku, and Nogi. Field
Marshal Oyama’s plan was for these five armies to form a crescent nearly
one hundred miles in length, the cusps of which would gradually draw
together, the western cusp being finally thrown forward so as to form a
closed curve with the eastern. The plan thus outlined worked with
perfect success. Kawamura, in the eastern sector, began the attack first
on February 22, driving the Russians back toward Tita. For over a
fortnight the fiercest sort of fighting continued in this part of the
field, in the midst of zero weather and almost continuous snowstorms. It
ended with the Russians driven across the Hun River and the right horn
of the crescent having reached its final position opposite Mukden.
Meanwhile, Kuroki broke through the formidable works which guarded the
road to the Hun River from Pensihu, and arrived on March 5 in line with
the general advance. Nodzu, to the left of Kuroki, drove the enemy from
his last outworks south of the Sha River, and on March 6 paused to await
the other turning attacks on east and west. Oku, between the Sha and Hun
Rivers, rolled back the enemy’s line until its superior numbers and
strong intrenchments near Patishu, about ten miles from Mukden, forced
him to await the final turning movement of Nogi’s men on the extreme
west. These men of Nogi’s were Port Arthur veterans, who looked upon
this work as a mere picnic. On March 1 they reached Sinmintung,
thirty-three miles west of Mukden, where they wheeled to the right. They
carried position after position, assisted Oku’s attacks against the
enemy’s position southwest of Mukden, swinging eastward in an
arch-shaped line with a front of fifteen miles.

The crisis of the fight had come. On March 7 Kuropatkin gave the order
to retreat. All along the hundred-mile line the Japanese closed in. The
whole stupendous structure of the defence fell to pieces in an instant.
The Russians poured northward almost in a rout, and on March 10 the
Japanese occupied Mukden. The Russians had left more than 30,000 dead on
the field, lost 50,000 prisoners, and they had over 100,000 wounded. The
total Japanese casualties, as reported by Oyama, were 50,000.

All the battalions were full before the battle. There was not one that
did not lose at least ten or fifteen per cent of its quota—as the gaps
in the ranks show. Kuroki’s army during the closing-in movement on
Mukden was between Nodzu’s and Kawamura’s, the latter being on the
extreme right wing. This photograph was taken by Frederick Palmer,

                              CHAPTER XIV
                     THE END OF RUSSIA’S SEA POWER


               BY CAPTAIN A. T. MAHAN, U. S. N., RETIRED

The Battle of the Japan Sea resulted from the wish of Russia to
overthrow the naval control which has enabled the island Empire of Japan
to sustain her land warfare upon the continent of Asia. Preliminary to
this struggle, it was desirable that the fleet despatched for the
purpose, under Admiral Rojestvensky, should reach Vladivostok. There it
could refit after its long voyage, and there leave in security the train
of supply ships which had been the necessary accompaniment of so distant
an expedition.

After the junction of a second division under Admiral Nebogatoff, the
whole Russian fleet moved northward, passing between the Philippine
Islands and Formosa. Rojestvensky thus left open to doubt, and retained
in his hands the decision, whether he would seek his port by the Straits
of Korea, or, circumnavigating the main island of Japan, pass through
the Straits of Tsugaru, opposite Vladivostok. It may be presumed he was
as ignorant as the rest of the world just where Togo was; but he knew
that, whether in the Straits of Korea or of Tsugaru, he would have to
fight, if Togo chose, as he probably would. He decided to take the most
direct and shortest route through the Korean Channel.

Toga awaited him there; at what particular point is immaterial, for the
Straits are but sixty miles wide, which space is halved by the Island of
Tsushima, whence the Straits have the alternate name—Tsushima. In such
narrow waters, wherever the Japanese Admiral might be, he was certain,
by an extensive scouting system, to receive notice timely enough to
ensure intercepting his enemy. The notice came by wireless telegraphy
early on Saturday, May 27, from cruisers off Quelpaert Island, 150 miles
southwest of Tsushima; and as the Russian fleet, heading for
Vladivostok, drew up with Tsushima, the Japanese battleships were seen
rounding its northern point. As regards the position of the Russian
ships, it seems certain, that, upon sighting the enemy, they formed in
two columns of vessels. One contained the armored ships, a very
heterogeneous assembly in size and qualities, composed of battleships of
the first and second class, armored cruisers, and coast-defence
ironclads. The second column was of lighter cruisers. This took the left
hand, toward Tsushima, while the battleships were on the right, toward
Japan. At the head of the battle column were three battleships; two of
the first order of strength, 13,516 tons, the third of 10,000 tons,
between them.

Admiral Togo divided his principal force of fighting ships into two
squadrons. One, of four battleships and two armored cruisers, he kept
under his own immediate direction. The other, of six armored cruisers,
which are battleships of superior swiftness, but somewhat lighter armor
and armament, was intrusted to Admiral Kamimura. The first of these
approached from the north of Tsushima; the second, and faster, followed
a little later from round its southern end. The head of the Russian
battle column received the weight of the Japanese fire, and the superior
speed of the latter enabled them so to choose their positions as to keep
their fire concentrated on these leading ships. Kamimura’s attack was on
the rear, and after that the battle soon became general. There was also
a third Japanese squadron, of vessels not belonging to the armored
fleet. These alone had been shown by Togo, until the Russian was
committed to the passage of the Straits. They are said now to have
attacked the other side of the Russian column. In brief, while Togo
threw the weight of his force upon the head of the enemy’s order, he
provided that the remainder should be so occupied as not to render
serious assistance.

There was a strong breeze from southwest with a heavy sea. This favored
the Japanese, because of their longer experience and better training in
the use of their guns when the ships were in violent motion. This
disadvantage of the Russians was increased by the rolling of their
vessels, exposing the underwater body, giving the Japanese a target more
easily pierced, and the holes from which are more dangerous. Through the
five hours of daylight the contest was purely one of gunnery under the
conditions named: concentration upon the head of the Russian columns,
and heavy sea. The result was twofold. The head of the column, beaten
down by superior gunfire, was disordered; and individual ships, pierced
below water, filled and sank. As described, the Japanese, keeping ahead
of their enemy, forced them to change direction; but this by no means
need follow, were the Russians holding their own in the gunnery contest.
Had they given as good as they got, there was no reason why they should
forsake their course. The disorder, thus occasioned in the front, was
transmitted to the ships which followed; and there ensued the confusion
which is the sure precursor of defeat.

Upon this scene night fell. Of the Russians, three battleships and two
others had already been sunk. Then came the time and opportunity for the
torpedo vessels; darkness, and an enemy both crippled and broken. By a
singular coincidence, the wind which in its strength favored the
Japanese gunners—an advantage which they had earned and deserved—now
fell somewhat; and with it fell the sea, rendering easier the work of
the torpedo craft. This is one of the chances of war. Of the scenes of
that night we as yet have little description, and from the fearful loss
of life we possibly may never know enough justly to estimate the
difficulties of the defence of the routed ships, or the degree of
resistance experienced by the assailants. From Japanese sources we have
heard that, under all the disadvantages of the Russians, some attacks
were successfully repelled; and three torpedo destroyers were sunk. That
pursuit continued to the Liancourt Rocks, 200 miles from the scene of
the battle, indicates that, had not superior gunnery already won a
decisive victory, the torpedo alone would scarcely so have reduced the
Russian fleet as to leave the Japanese the secure mastery they now
possess of the waters which constitute their vital line of
communications.

The captured ships were the battleships “Orel” and “Emperor Nicholas I,”
the coast-defence vessels “General Admiral Apraxine” and “Admiral
Seniavin,” and the destroyer “Bedovy.” Six battleships, five cruisers,
one coast-defence ship, three destroyers, and a repair ship were sunk.

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
