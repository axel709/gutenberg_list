                THE NEW CENTURY STANDARD LETTER WRITER

PART I

BUSINESS INTERCOURSE

CHAPTER I

COMMERCIAL CORRESPONDENCE

A. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS

Considering the vast amount of business transacted by correspondence
between the parties interested, Letter-Writing seems only second in
importance to bookkeeping. Merchants and others living at a distance
from the wholesale centers, usually order and remit by letter. It may
be that an error has occurred and needs correction. Credit is to be
asked, references given, and a multitude of other matters call for
adjustment through correspondence. To write every conceivable variety
and shade of meaning, expressing the proper thought in the most fitting
and appropriate language, is indeed a rare and valuable accomplishment.
And when the proper language takes on the graceful and businesslike
air of the well-written letter, with its several parts harmoniously
arranged, it is a combination of brain and skill which can hardly be
overestimated.

This subject, therefore, naturally divides itself into two parts: _The
Mechanical Structure_, and the _Literature of a Letter_. The former,
being the less difficult, will be first considered.


The Structure of a Business Letter.

Consists in the arrangement of its several parts, with a view to the
most harmonious effect. Whenever typewriting is not used, excellent
penmanship is very desirable, but not absolutely essential. The
penmanship may indeed be poor, but the arrangement of the several
parts of the letter, the neatness, and finish, may be such as to give
it an attractive appearance, while, on the other hand, the letter may
be clothed in the most elegant penmanship, and yet the construction
be such as to stamp its author as a careless and indifferent person,
devoid of precision and order.

Not one great thing, but many little things, carefully watched and
attentively practiced, make up the structure and dress of a business
letter, and give it a businesslike air. The penmanship should be a
neat, strong hand, very plain and legible, and devoid of all flourish.


Paper and Envelope.

The paper and envelopes used in business correspondence should be of a
good durable quality, and a white color is preferable. Cheap materials
are not only unsatisfactory to the writer, but may give the reader an
unfavorable impression, which would be an injury far exceeding the cost
of the best stationery for a lifetime. Persons form impressions from
very little things sometimes.

The size of a letter sheet in business correspondence should be
about 8½ x 11 inches. This sheet affords a sufficient space for a
communication of ordinary length, to be written on one side only, which
is essential in case the letter is copied in a letter press. A sheet of
paper, note size (5 x 8), is oftentimes used for brief communications
of no special importance, and not designed to be filed for future
reference. Among professional men the note paper is extensively used,
but with business men the letter size is considered preferable.

The envelope should correspond in size to that of the letter sheet,
and should be a trifle longer than one-half the length of the sheet.
Thus, in a sheet 8½ x 11 inches, one-half the length of the sheet is
5½ inches, and this requires the length of the envelope to be about
5¾ inches. Its width is usually about 3¼ inches. Avoid the use of
fancy colored and fancy shaped paper and envelopes. These may not be
objectionable in social correspondence among ladies (see Part IV, chap.
I), but the importance of business affairs does not admit of such
display.

The Heading.

The nature of the business is usually printed or engraved at the top of
the letter page, together with street, number and city, thus leaving
only the date to be inserted to complete the heading.

In case the heading of the letter is to be entirely written, it should
be placed so as to occupy the right-hand half of the first two lines
at the top of the page. If, however, the letter is to be a very brief
one, occupying only three or four lines, the heading may then be placed
lower down on the sheet, so as to bring the body of the letter about
the center of the sheet.

                                             _365 Wabash Avenue,
                                                 Chicago, May 5, 1900._

Writing from a large city, the heading should contain the street and
number. Your correspondent, in directing his answer, will rely on the
address given in your letter. Never be guilty of the blunder frequently
committed, of placing a part of the heading under the signature.

The second line of the heading should begin a little farther to the
right than the first line, as seen above:

                                   _P. O. Box, 2015,_
                                       _Philadelphia, August 10, 19--._

Writing from the principal cities of the United States, it is not
necessary to make the name of the State a part of the heading, as that
is supposed to be known and understood, but with smaller cities the
name of the State also should be given. In writing from an obscure town
or village, not only the State should be given, but the county as well.

                   _St. Charles, Kane County, Ill.,
                                 November 15, 19--._

The punctuation of the heading and other parts of the letter is of
great importance, and something which can be learned by a little
attention on the part of any one in examining the forms here given.


Margin.

A margin three-quarters of an inch in width should be left on the side
of the letter, as shown in the diagram. This is convenient for any mark
or memorandum which your correspondent may desire to make concerning
anything contained in the letter, but its greater value lies in the
open, airy, and cheerful dress which it imparts to the missive. A too
narrow margin conveys the idea of stinginess, as if to economize paper,
while an irregular or zigzag margin conveys the idea of carelessness
or want of precision. On a sheet of note paper, the margin may be only
one-half inch in width, thus making it proportionate to the size of the
sheet.


Address.

On the next line below the heading, that is, the third line from the
top of the sheet, and beginning at the left margin, should be placed
the _Address_, which consists of the name of the person to whom the
letter is written, together with his titles, if any, and his place of
residence or business.

  _Messrs. Duncan Bros. & Co.
    Peoria, Ill.
      Gentlemen_:

Or, if the letter is written to a person living or doing business in a
large city, thus:

  _Mr. James P. Hutchins,
    Counselor & Attorney-at-law,
      510 Chestnut St., Philadelphia, Pa.

         Dear Sir:_

The names and residence should not be allowed to extend further to the
right than about the center of the sheet, thus leaving an open space
between this and the heading of your letter. In case the names or place
of residence should be so long as to require it, they may be placed
thus:

  _Messrs. Pollard, Taylor, Jones
      & Duncan, St. Louis, Mo.

    Gentlemen:_

The words _Dear Sir_ or _Gentlemen_ are sometimes placed farther to
the left, as in the above example, but most business men in their
correspondence place this complimentary address with reference to the
words above them, about three-quarters of an inch farther to the right,
as shown below:

  _Arthur P. Dillingham, Esq.,
      210 Erie St., Boston.

         Dear Sir:_

The custom of placing the address beneath the body instead of at the
beginning of the letter is not much in vogue in business circles in
this country, most business men preferring to place the name and
address at the head of the sheet, and then write it as if they were
talking to the person himself. When, however, the address is placed
below the letter, it should occupy the same position as to the margin,
etc., as if placed at the beginning. The custom is borrowed from the
English, and its use is confined mostly to government officials,
professional men, and social intercourse.


Body of the Letter.

This constitutes the written message. It should begin on the same
line with the words, _Dear Sir_ or _Gentlemen_, leaving after these
words a small space. In case the place of residence or business is not
written in the address, then the complimentary address of _Dear Sir_ or
_Gentlemen_ will be placed on the next line under the name, or fourth
line from the top of the sheet, and the letter will begin on the fifth
line from the top, thus:

  _Mr. Frank L. Robinson,

      Dear Sir:--

             In answer to your favor----_

Sometimes, for the sake of convenience, and the saving of labor, the
letter head has printed in the left corner, above the address, a blank
form of memorandum, as follows:

  Referring to}           OR  In reply to      }
  yours of ...}               your favor of ...}

and after this introduction the writer is able speedily to get at the
marrow of his letter, without acknowledging the receipt of a former
communication.

The body of the letter should be divided into as many paragraphs as
there are distinct subjects in the letter, or a new paragraph should be
commenced at every change of the subject. The habit which some persons
have of tacking one subject to the end of another, and thus making a
letter one continuous paragraph of mixed-up information, instructions
and requests, is extremely objectionable. It destroys the force of what
is said, instead of fixing each thought clearly on the mind of the
reader; it leaves him confused, and he reads a second time and tries
to get his ideas fixed and systematized, or he throws aside the letter
until he has more time in which to study it and get the meaning clear.

If the letter is long and is really concerning only one subject, then
it may properly be divided into paragraphs by separating the different
divisions of the subject, and giving a paragraph to each. These should
be arranged in their logical order. Wherever the letter is to contain
numerous paragraphs, to avoid omitting any of the items it is best to
jot them down on a slip of paper, then embody them in the letter in
their natural order.

The first word of each paragraph should be indented, or moved in from
the margin, usually about the width of the margin. Thus, if the margin
is three-fourths of an inch in width, the paragraph should begin
three-fourths of an inch from the margin. Some writers, however, prefer
to commence the first word of the paragraph an inch from the margin,
and it is really not so essential what the distance is, provided it
be uniform, and all the paragraphs begin alike. A little attention
is necessary here. In ordering goods, make each article a separate
paragraph.


Complimentary Closing and Signature.

The complimentary closing consists of such words as _Yours truly_,
_Respectfully_, etc., and should be placed on the next line beneath
the last one occupied by the body of the letter, commencing a little
to the right of the middle. The signature should be placed underneath
the words of respect, and begin still a little farther to the right.
Thus the conclusion of the letter will correspond in position and
arrangement with the heading.

                                                   _Yours truly,
                                                         Thomas Smyth._

The language of the complimentary closing should be governed by
the relation between the parties, and should correspond with the
complimentary address. The first letter, even between strangers,
now generally commences with _Dear Sir_ and ends with the word
_Respectfully_. After the exchange of a few letters and a sort of
business acquaintance may be said to exist between the correspondents,
then _My Dear Sir_, and _Yours truly_, may properly be introduced. A
little more cordial would be such a conclusion as the following:

                                       _Yours very truly,
                                              Jones, Smith & Robinson._

The man of business is apt, however, to have one stereotyped beginning
and ending to all his letters, and seldom stops to discriminate between
strangers and old customers in this respect. Often the conclusion may
be connected to the closing paragraph with perfect grace and ease thus:

  _Hoping to receive the goods without delay, I remain,_

                            _Respectfully,
                                       Melville R. Johnson._

In the signature of a letter, especial care should be exercised.
Bear in mind that names of persons are not governed by the rules of
spelling, and words which precede or follow proper names will not aid
us in deciphering them if they are poorly written.


A Model Business Letter.

                                   210 S. Sixth Street,
                                            Cincinnati, March 11, 19--.

  Messrs. Bradley, Tomlinson & Co.,
          410 Broadway, New York.

          Gentlemen:--

                Inclosed please find New York Exchange in settlement of
  your Invoice of the 1st inst., less Cash discount.

  Amount of Invoice             $2,523.10
  Cash discount, 5%                126.15
                                ---------
  Draft inclosed,               $2,396.95

The goods have been received, and are very satisfactory in both quality
and price. You may expect another order soon.

                                            Yours truly,
                                                PHILLIPS BROTHERS & CO.

The young person who would learn to write a good business letter
should, with pen, ink and suitable paper begin to practice faithfully
after the above model. If necessary, write and re-write it a dozen
times or more, until your letter resembles it closely. Then take any
of the models for business letters given in this book, and, with this
specimen in front of you, write a letter which will conform with the
foregoing sample in appearance and dress. Write the same matter over
again, and improve it in its defects. Criticise each line and word.
See that no words or letters are omitted, and that the punctuation is
according to the models in this volume. Eliminate all ungainly letters,
see that each of them rests on the line, and that, withal, your page is
clean and regular.

The person who will thus devote a little earnest study and practice
may early acquire the valuable accomplishment of writing a pleasing
business letter, so far as the mechanical structure goes. For the
contents, the model letter will also furnish the necessary practical
points.


Typewritten Letters.

It must be stated here that all the above principles, rules and
recommendations apply to type-written letters, as well as to their
contents as to general arrangement of the text.

It is considered absolutely bad form and almost impertinent, to use a
typewriter in social correspondence. The writing machine is reserved
exclusively for business or official correspondence.


Addressing the Envelope.

After the letter is finished, and before it is copied on the letter
press, the envelope should be addressed. As before stated, the
directions on the envelope must conform to the address at the beginning
of the letter, hence the necessity for addressing the envelope before
the letter is folded.

The first line of the address of the envelope should consist of the
name of the person or firm to whom the letter is written, together with
any appropriate titles, and should be written across or a little below
the middle of the envelope, but never above it, beginning near the left
edge. The space between this first line and the bottom of the envelope
should be about equally divided among the other lines, each of which
begins still farther to the right than the one above (see page 26).

  +------------------------------------------------------+
  |                                                      |
  |                                                      |
  |         _Messrs. Bradley, Tomlinson & Co.,_          |
  |                                                      |
  |                      _410 Broadway,_                 |
  |                                                      |
  |                               _New York City._       |
  +------------------------------------------------------+

When writing to a person in a large city the number and street should
be a part of the address, and may be placed as in the above form, or in
the left-hand lower corner as follows:

  +------------------------------------------------------+
  |                                                      |
  |                                                      |
  |             _Messrs. Laird & Lee_,                   |
  |                                                      |
  |                          _Publishers_,               |
  |                                                      |
  |                               _Chicago, Ill._        |
  |  _263-65 Wabash Ave._                                |
  +------------------------------------------------------+

In case the letter is addressed in care of any one, this should be
inserted in the lower left corner. In a letter of introduction, the
words _Introducing Mr. John Smith_, or similar words, should be placed
in this corner.

Letters addressed to small towns or villages should bear the name of
the county, as follows:

  +------------------------------------------------------+
  |                                                      |
  |                                                      |
  |                   _Mr. David Lyons_,                 |
  |                                                      |
  |                         _Washington_,                |
  |                                                      |
  |                          _Porter County_,            |
  |                                                      |
  |  _P. O. Box No. 37._            _Ala._               |
  +------------------------------------------------------+

Or the name of the county may be placed in the lower left corner. The
post office box number is usually placed in that place.


Folding a Letter.

Having written an excellent letter, and faultlessly addressed the
envelope, all may be easily stamped as unbusinesslike, and spoiled, by
improperly performing so simple a part as the folding. Remember this
excellent rule that, whatever is worth doing is worth doing well.

With the letter sheet lying before you, turn the bottom edge up so that
it lies along with the top edge, thus making a fold in the middle,
which press down with the thumb nail or with a paper folder. Then fold
the right edge over so that it falls two-thirds the distance across the
sheet, and press down the edge. Next fold the left edge of the sheet
over to the right, breaking the fold at the edge of the part folded
over just before.

In case a check, note, draft, bill or currency is to be sent by letter,
it should be placed on the upper half of the sheet as it lies open,
and then the letter should be folded the same as if it were not there.
This will fold the paper or document in the letter so that it will be
difficult to extract it while being transmitted in the mails, and so
that it will not be dropped or lost in opening the letter.

The letter is now folded so that it will be of equal thickness in every
part of the envelope. Insert the edge last folded in the envelope
first, with the original edges of the sheet at the end of the envelope
which the stamp is on; when taken from the envelope the letter will
then be proper side up.


The Literature of a Letter.

To be able to compose a letter requires more ability than to give it
the proper arrangement and mechanical appearance. A mind well stored
with useful knowledge as well as command of language, is necessary in
writing a letter on general subjects. The strictly business letter
requires a thorough understanding of the facts concerning which the
letter is written, and these facts to be set forth in plain and
unmistakable language. All display of rhetoric or flourish of words
is entirely out of place in the sober, practical letter of business.
The proper use of capital letters, punctuation, and correct spelling
is essential to the well-written letter, and with a little care and
perseverance may be easily acquired.


Arrangement of Items.

As stated before, each item or subject in a letter should be embraced
in a separate paragraph. These should be arranged in the order in
which they would naturally come, either in point of time, importance,
or as regards policy. Never begin a letter abruptly with a complaint,
but rather bring in all unpleasant subjects toward the close. In an
answer to a letter of inquiry, take up the questions as they are asked,
indicate first what the question is, and then state clearly the answer.
The first paragraph should acknowledge the receipt of the communication
now to be answered, giving date and indicating its nature and contents,
thus:

    _Your favor of the 10th instant concerning damaged goods received,
    etc._

The closing paragraph frequently begins with such words as _Hoping_,
_Trusting_, _Awaiting_, _Thanking_, or similar expressions, and is
complimentary in its tone and designed as a courtesy.


Brevity.

Business letters should be brief and to the point. The best letter
states clearly all the facts in the fewest words. Brevity is not
inconsistent with a long letter, as so much may need to be said as to
require a long letter, but all repetitions, lengthy statements and
multiplication of words should be avoided. Use short sentences, and
make every word mean something. Short sentences are more forcible, and
more easily understood or remembered, than long drawn-out utterances.


Style.

By style we mean the tone, air, or manner of expression. Dignity
and strength should characterize the style of the business letter.
No ornament of expression or eloquence of language is necessary or
appropriate in a correspondence between business men. Come to your
meaning at once. State the facts. Let every sentence bristle with
points.

The successful business man must possess energy, decision, and force,
and these qualities should be conspicuous in his correspondence in
order to command respect. Never use loose or slang expressions. The
business man should be a _gentleman_. Indulge in no display of superior
knowledge or education, but temper each paragraph with respect and
deference to others.


Ordering Goods.

In ordering goods of any kind, care should be used to state very
explicitly the color, size, quality, and quantity of the articles
desired. If manufactured goods, the name of the manufacturer, or his
trade mark or brand, should be given. Also state when you desire the
goods shipped, and by what route. If by freight or express, state what
freight line or express company. Sometimes it is appropriate to write
simply, "By cheapest route."


Sending Money by Letter.

Paper currency should seldom be trusted to pass through the mails,
as the liability to loss is too great. Better send draft on New York
or Chicago; P. O. or express, money order, or funds in a registered
letter, and in every case the amount of the remittance should be stated
in the letter, and also whether by draft or otherwise sent. The letter
may become important evidence in regard to payment at some future time.


Instructions.

In giving instructions to agents, manufacturers and others, let each
order occupy a separate paragraph. State in unmistakable language the
instructions desired to be conveyed. Whenever necessary or desirable,
a diagram or plan should be enclosed in the letter. Cautions and
complaints, if any, should be clearly set forth in paragraphs near the
close of the letter.


A Dunning Letter.

State when the debt was contracted, the amount, the fact of it having
been long past due, the necessity for immediate payment, and any other
facts depending on the peculiarities of the case, which it may seem
best to make use of, such as promises to pay, which have not been
met; the inconvenience as well as injury and distrust caused by such
irregularities, etc.


The Importance of Copying Letters.

No experienced business man ever allows a letter to leave his office
before it has been copied in a letter book kept for the purpose.
Although this operation is especially important whenever the statements
in the letter contain any clause obligating the writer, it is better
to have the whole correspondence copied, as no one knows, ahead, the
importance that the most apparently insignificant signed statement may
have in the future.


Answering Promptly.

Nothing does more good to a young business man starting on his own
account, than to answer promptly all letters addressed to him, be
they of ever so little importance. Older firms will at once recognize
in this single fact of promptness in answering letters the excellent
business habits that make men successful. To delay answering, when
it is not done for a special purpose, and is simply the result of
negligence, may often be of the greatest consequence, and injure the
credit as well as the standing of the writer.


Employers and Employes.

The correspondence between employers and employes ought to be
characterized by kindness and firmness on the part of the first,
and proper respect on the part of the second. Neither harshness nor
subserviency are to be desired, as they quickly culminate in disrespect
or contempt, or both. Applications for position must be carefully
worded, and the letters written with minute attention to detail, as
many a start in life has been made and marred by a first letter from
would-be employe to employer.


Various Notices

and communications of a general character have to be sent, at times, by
business houses going through the different periods of organization,
prosperity, adversity, dissolution and liquidation. These announcements
are worded in a more or less stereotyped style, and we insert, in this
volume, the models for use in such cases.

                                              B----, February 14, 19--.

  GENTLEMEN:--

In the "Journal" this morning I notice your advertisement calling
for the services of a bookkeeper. I beg leave to offer myself for
the place, feeling confident that I am qualified to fill it to your
satisfaction.

I am thirty-two years of age, healthy, active, married. I have had five
years' experience with my last employers, Simpson & Ryder who have
recently liquidated their business, and who will gladly bear witness to
my qualifications.

Should my application be regarded favorably, I shall endeavor to

follows_:

                                             O----, September 10, 19--.

  E. B., Herald Office,
  City.

  DEAR SIR:--

Replying to the above advertisement, I would respectfully offer my
services.

I am 19 years of age, have a good education, and had some experience
in business, having assisted my father in his grocery store. I am
not afraid of work, and never allow myself to be idle when there is
anything to do. I can refer you, as to my character, to Mr. William
Stuart, manager of the City R. R. Co., who has known me all my life.

Regarding salary, I leave that with you, but feel certain that I could
earn ten dollars per week.

Hoping to have the pleasure of an interview,

                                                 I remain,
                                                     Respectfully,
                                                          ROBERT GRANT.

                                               D----, January 10, 19--.

  The Lake Steamship Supply Co.,
  D----.

  GENTLEMEN:--

Permit me to apply for the situation as shipping clerk, which I
have heard is now vacant in your establishment. I am 23 years of
age, and have worked eighteen months for Messrs. Scotch & Irish,
retail provision dealers of this city, to whom I could refer you
as to character and ability should you entertain this application.
I left them solely on account of their making a reduction in their
establishment. Messrs. S. & I. had an extensive country connection, and
I have therefore had some experience in their method of doing business.
I may mention the wages I received with them were $12 per week.

In hopes of hearing from you favorably,

                                         I remain,
                                              Yours obediently,
                                                       ARTHUR P. JONES.


=5. Applying for a Situation in a Retail Store.=

  Messrs. Halifax & Stein,
  City.

  GENTLEMEN:--

I have been informed that you are in need of an experienced
floor-walker in your establishment. Have filled a similar situation
with Messrs. Oppenheim, Rothenstein & Co., of this city, for the
last three years, and there is no doubt they will furnish excellent
references regarding my ability, honesty, etc. I am desirous of
obtaining a salary of $15 a week. If this meets your views, and should
you consider that I am likely to suit, perhaps you would kindly favor
me with a reply appointing the time to call upon you.

                               I remain,
                                     Yours obediently,
                                                    SAMUEL STRASBURGER.

  Messrs. Smith & Brown,
  City.

  GENTLEMEN:--

I am very desirous of placing my son in a retail store, and understand
that you have an opening at the present moment for an errand boy. He
is 16 years of age, writes a good hand, and is very quick at figures.
As he has everything to learn, I should be willing to give his
services for three to six months at nominal wages, for the sake of the
experience he would acquire. Of course, he boards with us.

Awaiting the favor of your reply,

                               I remain,
                                     Yours respectfully,
                                                          ROBERT PRICE.

                                               H----, January 14, 19--.

  Dear Mr. Hubbard:--

I venture to take the liberty of asking you to interest yourself in my
son. I am very desirous of obtaining a clerkship for him, and thought
perhaps if a vacancy occurred in your Bank you would kindly remember
him. Although I am aware you must have many applications of this
nature, I cannot resist taking the chance of its being in your power to
do something for us in this way. He is 18 years of age, and has been
educated in Germany, which may be in his favor, as he is considered a
good linguist. Still, he expects to begin at the bottom of the ladder;
he has no false pride, and plenty of pluck and perseverance. I need not
say how grateful I should be if you would consider this request.

                              Believe me,
                                   Very truly yours,
                                                       LAURA B. MILLER.

  Messrs. Bacon & Blackstone,
  City.

  GENTLEMEN:--

I beg leave to apply for a position as student in your office, and I
enclose testimonials and recommendations. I am a Harvard B.A., and am
just finishing my second year's studies at the Union Law School. I feel
very desirous of entering the practical side of the profession. I am a
quick stenographer and Remington operator. For the first three months,
I shall not expect any salary, although my whole time would be yours
outside of my law-school work.

Holding myself at your disposal for a personal interview,

                               I remain,
                                    Yours obediently,

  Messrs. Turner & Co.

  GENTLEMEN:--

I ask permission to apply for a position in your establishment. In June
last I graduated from the High School of this city. Since that time
I have attended Franklin & Mason's Business College, with a view of
preparing myself to enter on a business career. I was eighteen years of
age last August, and the time has now come when I must devote myself to
the serious work of life. Being anxious to engage with a house where
I can learn all the details and become thoroughly conversant with the
business, I should be glad to accept any position you may have to
offer. I am quite willing to begin at the bottom of the ladder and
master each round as I climb. My family live in the city, and we are
all well known to Mr. Nathan, who is, I believe, the head of one of
your departments. I beg to refer you to him for any information you may
desire and am also authorized to give you the names of Messrs. Franklin
& Mason, the proprietors of the Business College, Main Street, and that
of the Rev. Morgan Dodd, Pastor of the First Methodist-Episcopal Church.

                           I am, gentlemen,
                                   Yours respectfully,
                                                         HENRY JOHNSON.

  Messrs. Fair & Fee,
    Publishers, City.

  GENTLEMEN:--

I understand that you have a position as stenographer vacant in your
office, and beg leave to apply for the same. I am a quick stenographer
and operator on any of the standard machines, and have had three years'
experience, two of which have been spent with the Edison Co., of this
city. I left them on account of sickness in my family, but am allowed
to give the Company as reference.

My expectations as to salary are about $8 a week to begin with. I hope
for some increase after proving myself entirely satisfactory.

Trusting you will kindly consider this application,

                               I remain,
                                    Yours respectfully,

To the Manager of The Cordage Machinery Co.

  SIR:--

In answer to your advertisement in the "Herald" of Sunday, the 13th
inst., for a young lady to act as bookkeeper, I beg to apply for the
situation. I am 18 years of age, and have assisted my father during the
last four years in keeping his books; he is a general contractor and
builder. I am quick at figures, and a good accountant. I should be very
glad to offer my services for a month on trial, that you might judge of
my general business ability and activity. I live with my widowed father.

Mrs. Willis, of 190 W---- Street, will answer any questions respecting
me. She has known me since I was a baby.

Hoping for a favorable answer,

                               I remain,
                                   Yours obediently,

  To the Proprietor of the Grafton House.
    D----.

  GENTLEMEN:--

Am I in time to apply for the position of Manager of your hotel,
which I am informed will shortly become vacant? The fact of my having
been steward of the Union Club for the last seven years will, I hope,
influence you in my favor; several gentlemen on the House committee
have kindly promised to recommend me, and to speak favorably as to my
management of the Club and general reliability and honesty.

Previous to being steward of the above mentioned Club, I was head
waiter at the L---- Hotel, C----, for over three years, and the
proprietors of that establishment would also give me the highest
recommendation.

Perhaps I had better mention that the salary I feel justified in asking
is $1500 per annum, with full board for self and wife.

Should you entertain this application, I should be pleased to call upon
you at any hour you may appoint, and beg to remain, in the meantime,

                                            Yours respectfully,
                                                        HENRY DESSAUER.

  The Double-Stitch Sewing Machine Co.
    D----.

  GENTLEMEN:--

There is a fair opening in our city for the sale of your sewing
machines, and I should like to act as local agent, if you feel so
disposed. My premises are well suited for the purpose, being situated
in the business center and best block. I do a large business in
hardware specialties, and have great opportunities of introducing
anything in the line of sewing machines, bicycles, etc., to the notice
of the town people and neighboring farmers.

I have a young man and a wagon constantly on the road, visiting
farmhouses. The H---- National Bank will give you satisfactory
references concerning my commercial standing. I also trade regularly
with the Beelzebub Stove Co. of your city.

When sending me your answer, please also enclose circulars, rates of
best discounts, etc., and oblige,

                                                Yours truly,

requisite in an institution of this nature.

To Whom It May Concern:--

Mrs. La Crosse is able to speak in the highest terms of Margaret

Mrs. La Crosse has no doubt that Margaret O'Brien will be a valuable
addition to the staff of any establishment such as the one she has been
attached to for several years.

  Mr. Oswald Smith,
    City.

  SIR:--

Would you be disposed to give me a small increase of salary, beginning
January 1st next? At my age and with my experience I feel that I ought
to be earning more than I at present receive. Perhaps, when you take
into consideration the fact that I have been in your employ over two
years, you will not think this an unreasonable request, and be inclined
to grant it. I need not say that in any case, while I remain with
you, my best energies will continue to be as they have hitherto been,
devoted to your interests.

                                               I remain,

in my power.

  GENTLEMEN:--

I deeply regret the feeling of irritation which induced me to give you
notice yesterday: will you permit me to apologize for so doing, and to
ask you to allow me to recall it? I venture to make this request in the
hope that my long, and I may say faithful, services will plead in my
favor. Trusting that this frank statement of regret will meet with a
favorable answer,

                                                  C----, March 5, 19--.

  Messrs. Brown Bros. & Co.
    City.

  GENTLEMEN:--

Am very sorry I was unable to come to the office this morning owing to
a severe attack of illness. I enclose a certificate from the doctor who
is attending me, as he fears it will be several days before I shall be
able to resume my duties. I trust that my enforced absence will not
occasion you any serious inconvenience.

With renewed regrets, I beg to remain, Gentlemen,

                                                    Yours respectfully,
                                                           JOSEPH LEVY.


=30. From a Widow, Announcing the Death of Her Husband to His Late
Employers.=

                                              C----, December 20, 19--.

  Messrs. Ernst & Upham.
    City,

  GENTLEMEN:--

With the deepest sorrow, I have to announce the death of my dear and
devoted husband, which occurred last night after only a week's illness.
Painful as it is to me to write to you under this terrible blow, I feel
it my duty to inform you of it at once, on account of the position he
occupied in your house.

I remain, in great grief and trouble,

                                                    Yours respectfully,
                                                           HILDA WAYNE.


=31. From a Commercial Traveler to His Employers.=

                                                  B----, April 4, 19--.

  Messrs. Roberts & Elliott.

  GENTLEMEN:--

I enclose a batch of orders secured from the first six cities on my
route; I trust they will meet with your approval. I wish that, this
being my first trip in your interest, the orders were more in number
and for larger amounts. I have done my best, however, to head off some
of my competitors, and in several cases I have been successful. A few
got ahead of me in the matter of time, but I do not think they did much
business.

I firmly believe that the goods I offer are unsurpassed in their line,
and that the prices and terms ought to call forth an instant and
generous response on the part of the trade. But times are dull and
business men, just now, seem to be over-cautious.

They seem perfectly satisfied with our goods, prices and terms, but
they are, nevertheless, terribly afraid of overstocking themselves. Any
number of promises are made to order in a short time--but we all know
what these promises amount to. In spite of all, I am impressed with the
hopeful spirit that prevails. There is a general feeling that better
times are in sight. When confidence is fully restored, I have no doubt
we shall have a splendid trade.

Kindly keep me posted on any novelties you may have on hand.

With the repeated assurance of my determination to do all I can in your
interest,

                                             I am, Gentlemen,
                                                  Yours respectfully,
                                                     ISAAC SILBERSTEIN.


=32. Another Letter from a Commercial Traveler to His Employers.=

  Messrs. Dudley Bros. & Co.,
   N----.

  GENTLEMEN:--

Enclosed please find a list of ten orders which I have taken from some
of our regular customers in this city. I have been able to extend
our trade by adding two new firms to our list, and I believe in both
instances you will find them good and reliable. I proceed to-morrow
to P----, where I propose remaining two days; my address will be, The
Continental.

                                                      Yours obediently,

  GENTLEMEN:--

My old friend, Farmer Harry Jones, of St. Joseph, spoke to me, the
other day, about your firm, and the satisfactory business relations he
has had with you for the past three years. I have decided to place the
sale of my produce in your hands. I ship every year about

  5,000 bu. of Rose Potatoes,
  1,200 bu. of Turnips,
  3,500 bu. of Carrots,

and a lot of other garden truck.

We are on the Father Marquette R. R., and also about five miles from
Lake Michigan. Please let me know your best terms for handling my stuff
on the Chicago market, and how promptly you remit after sales are
completed.

I may have some peaches, apples and grapes for you, during the season,
although I ship most of my fruit to Grand Rapids, where I have had a
ready market for nearly four years.

Hoping to hear from you soon, I remain,

  The Stanley Book Jobbing Co.
    L----.

  GENTLEMEN:--

We have now been expecting for over two weeks the case of books for
which you mailed us invoice on the 20th ult. We fail to understand the
reason for such an unwarranted delay in the delivery of these goods,
shipped, we understand from your letter, over the "Blue Line," and
which ought not to have been more than four days in transit between
your city and ours.

As the holiday season has practically begun, we are in great need of
these books, and would lose much of our chance of selling them if their
delivery were delayed much longer. Kindly trace the case at once, and
let us hear from you regarding it as soon as possible.

                                           We remain,

=47. Complaining to a Freight Line Agency of Unwarrantable Delay in the
Delivery of Goods.=

                                              L----, December 12, 19--.

  To the L---- Manager of the "Blue Line" Agency,
    L----.

  DEAR SIR:--

We are in receipt of a letter dated 10th inst. from Messrs. Stonington
& Co., Booksellers, of P----, complaining of not having received up
to that date a case of books we shipped them over your line on the
20th ult. The case was marked "S. C.," and we hold your receipt for
same. The delay in delivery, at this time of year, is causing serious
inconvenience to our customers, and we earnestly hope that the case
will be traced by telegraph and that you may be able, within the next
few hours, to notify us that it has finally reached its destination.

To avoid loss of time, we send you this letter by messenger. Trusting
that you will do your best to have this matter straightened out at once,

                              We remain,
                                   Yours truly,
                        THE STANLEY BOOK JOBBING CO.,
                                                  Per P. Dunmore, Secy.


=48. Answer to the Above.=

                                              L----, December 12, 19--.

  The Stanley Book Jobbing Co.,
    L----.

  GENTLEMEN:--

In answer to your favor of even date, to which we gave our immediate
attention, we are happy to say that we just received telegraphic notice
that the case of books marked "S. C." was delivered this a.m. to
Messrs. Stonington & Co., of P----. The cause of delay was due to the
misdirection of a car, which it took us about four days to trace up.
Regretting this delay, and hoping that it will not have caused you and
your customer any serious inconvenience,

                                                   We remain,
                                                      Yours truly,
                                                THE BLUE LINE AGENCY,
                                                              Per D. D.


=49. Complaining of Goods having been Shipped by Express instead of
Freight, as Ordered.=

                                               D----, January 22, 19--.

  Messrs. Johnson & Brothers,
    C----.

  GENTLEMEN:--

We were much surprised to receive to-day the last bill of goods shipped
via the American Express instead of the A. B. D. R. R. Co., as we
especially instructed you, in our letter of the 10th inst., to make
the shipment by freight and not by express. As a consequence the cost
of transportation was $3.10 more than it would have been by freight.
Kindly let us hear from you how the mistake was made, and believe us,

                                                 Yours truly,
                                                      WILSON, DAY & CO.


=50. Answer to the Above.=

                                               C----, January 25, 19--.

  Messrs. Wilson, Day & Co.,
    D----.

  GENTLEMEN:--

Answering your favor of 22d inst., we deeply regret that the mistake
was made in the route chosen for the shipment of your last order. By
referring to your favor of 10th inst., we find that you had ordered the
package sent by freight if it weighed over 25 pounds. To compensate
you for extra expense incurred, we credit your account with $3.10,
difference between freight and express rates in the invoice herein
mentioned.

Hoping that this settlement of the little difficulty will prove
perfectly satisfactory, and confidently expecting further orders,

                                           We remain,
                                             Yours very truly,
                                                      JOHNSON BROTHERS.


=D. CREDITS AND BUSINESS REFERENCES=


=51. From a New Business Firm Desirous of Opening an Account.=

  Messrs. Holmes & Wilson,                     C----, December 10, 19--.
    N----.

  GENTLEMEN:--

Having recently established myself in the retail Hardware business in
this city, with fair prospects of success, and being in need of goods
from time to time, I would like to open an account with your highly
respected house.

My capital is small, but I have the satisfaction of knowing that what
little I possess is the fruit of my own industry and saving. I can
refer you to the well-known firm of Smith, Day & Co., of your city, as
to my character and standing.

Should my reference prove satisfactory, please forward me at once, by
Adams Express:

  2 Butcher's Bow Saws,
  ½ doz. Mortise Locks, with Porcelain Knobs,
  2 kegs 8d Nails,

and charge to my account. My habit is to settle on the 20th all bills
rendered on or before the 1st of each and every month.

Hoping that my order may receive your usual prompt attention, I am,

                                            Yours respectfully,
                                                   WILLIAM T. BROWNING.


=52. Favorable Answer to the Above.=

  Mr. William T. Browning,                     N----, December 14, 19--.
    C----. O----.

  DEAR SIR:--

We take pleasure in filling this day the order inclosed in your favor
of 10th inst, as your reference proved quite satisfactory. You will
find that we have given you the best terms customary in our business.
Hoping to be frequently favored with your patronage,

                                                    We remain,
                                                     Yours truly,

                                              N----, December 14, 19--.

  Mr. William T. Browning,
    C----.

  DEAR SIR:--

In reply to your favor of 10th inst., we have to say that we must ask
you to remit the cash before filling your order.

We trust that you will not consider us unnecessarily harsh; we know
nothing of your business methods, and as the profit on our goods is so
close, we prefer not to open an account.

Perhaps we may become better acquainted in the future. Awaiting your
reply,

                                              We remain,
                                               Respectfully yours,

                                                   C----, May 11, 19--.

  Messrs. Sullivan & Co.,
    X----.

  GENTLEMEN:--

We understand that you are desirous of opening an account with our
firm. Will you favor us with two references, as we have hitherto had no
business transactions with you? In all cases when cash payments do not
accompany the orders received from firms personally unknown to us, it
is our rule to ask for references.

                                           We remain,
                                               Yours obediently,

  The Fifth National Bank of X----.

  GENTLEMEN:--

We are about to engage in rather extensive transactions with the firm
of Sullivan & Co., of your city, and as a matter of precaution we
venture to ask if you can give us any information, in the strictest
confidence, respecting their commercial position, and the estimation in
which they are held.

Trusting that, if it is in your power, you will so far oblige us, and
holding ourselves ready to reciprocate,

                                             We remain,
                                                Yours obediently,

Replying to your favor of the 15th inst., we beg to say our business
relations with Messrs. Sullivan & Co. have been hitherto most
satisfactory, and we have a personal esteem for them as men of thorough
integrity.

  DEAR SIRS:--

Replying to yours of 15th inst., we beg to inform you that we have no
personal knowledge as to the standing of Messrs. Sullivan & Co., of
our city; however, we have made several inquiries respecting them, in
reliable quarters, and have not, we regret to say, learned anything in
their favor.

                                      We remain,
                                             Yours truly,

  Late Judge Superior Court,
    X----.

  DEAR SIR:--

Messrs. Sullivan & Co., Dry Goods Retail Dealers, of your city, desire
to open an account with us, and have given your name as a reference.
We are desirous to know if their general standing in the community
warrants us extending them a line of credits. They claim that, having
acted as their attorney and counsel for several years, you are
conversant with their resources and commercial habits.

Thanking you in advance for whatever information you will give us,
strictly in confidence,

                                            We remain,

  GENTLEMEN:--

Please allow the bearer of this, Mr. Frank Hubbard, who is a friend of
mine and a thoroughly reliable man, a credit for such goods as he may
select, not exceeding two thousand dollars ($2,000), and if he does not
pay for them, I will.

Please notify me of the amount of the purchase and when due, and if the
account is not settled promptly, according to agreement, write at once
or draw for the amount.

                                                    Yours truly,

    L----.

  DEAR SIR:--

As I informed you, a year ago, I have been thinking seriously of
disposing of my small business here and locating in some large town out
on the Pacific Coast, where I can grow up with the country as you are
doing.

Will you have the kindness to write me, at your convenience, full
information in regard to the prospects of business, rates of rents,
cost of living, and any other details, especially in regard to the Book
and Stationery trade?

If you will thus kindly give me the facts on which I can base my
calculations, and all is favorable, I shall probably visit L---- this
fall, and eventually become your neighbor.

                                                Yours very truly,

Allow me to remind you that your account has been standing for several

I should not even now have called your attention to the matter, were it
not that, in a few days, I must meet a large bill, and shall rely in

I would, therefore, esteem it a great favor if you would remit either
the whole, or at least the greater part, of the amount due, in the
course of a week or ten days.

As you failed to take any notice of my letter of the 13th inst.,
relating to a settlement of your account, now long overdue, I shall
feel obliged, to my sincere regret, to have the claim placed into

  DEAR SIRS:--

May we ask your kind indulgence with regard to our overdue account?
Owing to unforseen circumstances, we find it is not in our power to
settle it under three months from this date. We think it best to
solicit this favor frankly rather than to allow you to expect a payment
unfortunately not forthcoming. We need not say how much we regret this
delay, which is nevertheless unavoidable.

                                             We remain,

                                              B----, December 15, 19--.

  Phillips & Dunham,
    L----.

  GENTLEMEN:--

On the 1st of January next the partnership for the past ten years
existing between Edward B. Hanley and Horace O'Neil, Grocers, will be
dissolved by mutual consent.

We take this opportunity to thank our patrons and friends for the
liberal support extended to us during our business career.

After the 1st of January the business will be carried on at the old
stand, Nos. 6 and 8 River Street, by Horace O'Neil and Julius Stern,
under the firm name of O'Neil & Stern. We trust you will favor the new
firm with your business.

                                        With renewed thanks, we remain,
                                                Your obedient servants,
                                                       HANLEY & O'NEIL.

  Messrs. Deward & Sons,
    N----.

  GENTLEMEN:--

It is with deep regret that we have to inform you of the recent death
of our senior partner, Mr. T. Hurd, which occurred on the 5th inst.

At the same time, we have the satisfaction of stating that this sad
event will in no way interfere with the future conduct of our business,
as arrangements are being made to supply the place of our deceased
partner.

For the present, no alteration will be made in the name of the firm.

The surviving partner, Mr. Augustus Densmore, will conduct the affairs
as usual, and we confidently hope that, from the experience you have
had of our uniform punctuality and regularity, you will continue to
favor us with your orders, resting assured that the same unremitting
attention as formerly will be paid to the interests of our customers.

                                             We remain, Gentlemen,
                                               Yours respectfully,
                                                   HURD, DENSMORE & CO.


=71. From a Business House giving Notice of a Change in the Firm Name.=

                                                   P----, June 5, 19--.

  Messrs. Phillips & Stern,
    N----.

  GENTLEMEN:--

We beg to inform you of an alteration to take place in the name and
copartnership of this firm, on July 1st. Our Mr. Robert Stephenson will
withdraw, and his son, Mr. Anthony Todd Stephenson, will be admitted as
a full partner, with his father's share in the capital and profits of
the firm. The style of the new concern will be Stephenson & Nephew.

We request a continuance of your favor, and assure you that there will
be no relaxation of our efforts to conduct business affairs in the
usual conservative manner.

                                                  Truly yours,
                                                       STEPHENSON BROS.


=72. From a Business House Recommending a Successor in Business.=

                                              B----, December 20, 19--.

  To the Public:--

It is with some feeling of regret that we announce our retirement from
business on the beginning of the new year.

Stock and premises will then be transferred to Messrs. Fairfax
Brothers, whom we cheerfully present to your notice, and feel it our
duty to recommend them for a continuance of that liberal confidence and
patronage which you have bestowed on us during the past twenty years.

Both these young gentlemen have been clerks in this establishment for a
long time, and are in every way efficient and capable to continue the
business.

                                                    We are,
                                                      Respectfully,

  To Our Creditors.

  GENTLEMEN--

In consequence of the failure of the Tenth National Bank, of our
city, we regret to find ourselves unable to continue business without
resorting to costly expedients, which, in the interest of our
creditors, we are anxious to avoid. To duly protect all concerned,
we have decided to make an assignment of all our property, and this
decision has already met with the approval of the principal local
creditors. We have had the good fortune, in this trouble to secure the
services, as assignee, of Mr. Walter Mead, a wealthy and well-known
retired merchant of this city, who will without delay prepare a
statement of our affairs, and submit it to you at an early date.

With renewed regrets for the unforeseen circumstances that have
brought about this painful state of affairs, and earnestly counting on
considerate treatment on your part,

                                            We remain,
                                               Yours sincerely,
                                                    DOMINICK & BRONSON.

=74. From a Gentleman of Leisure to his Bank.=

                                                B----, August 10, 19--.

  Cashier Pilgrim Loan & Trust Co.,
  B----.

  DEAR SIR:--

Answering your favor of the 4th inst., I was not aware I had overdrawn
my account, as I had ordered my brokers, Samuels & Loeb, to deposit to
my credit $375 on the first of the month; but I will at once attend
to the matter, and request them by same mail to pay said amount to my
account in your bank to-morrow, Thursday, before close of business.

Regretting the incident, and thanking you for honoring my last check,

                                             I remain,
                                               Yours sincerely,
                                                        STEPHEN DUNDAS.


=75. From a Lady to her Bank.=

                                                   C----, May 10, 19--.

  Cashier Tenth National Bank,
    C----.

  DEAR SIR:--

Kindly place the enclosed check of $2,500 on the National City Bank,
N----, to my account; I shall be obliged if you will forward me a check
book of fifty checks.

                                                      Very truly yours,
                                                          MARIA TILDEN.


=76. From a Tenant to his Landlord, concerning Repairs.=

                                                 C----, March 22, 19--.

  Albert Davenport, Esq.
    City.

  DEAR SIR:--

Will you kindly send some one at once to examine the roof of this
house, as the rain comes through in several places. I am sorry to say
the pipes are also out of order, and require immediate attention to
prevent further mischief.

                                                     I remain,
                                                      Yours truly,
                                                         HENRY FAIRFAX.


=77. Answer to the Above.=

                                                 C----, March 24, 19--.

  Henry Fairfax, Esq.,
    City.

  DEAR SIR:--

Your favor of the 22d inst. duly received; I have instructed my agent,
Mr. Wilson, to have the necessary repairs done without delay; but, as
regards papering and painting the rooms you mentioned in a preceding
letter, I think it must be deferred until next year, when I will
see what can be done. I must remind you that you were aware of the
condition of the house when you took it, and that I made no promise
respecting redecorations, as the rent paid by you does not warrant my
incurring the outlay.

                                                   I remain,
                                                      Yours obediently,
                                                      ALBERT DAVENPORT.


=78. From a Tenant to his Landlord, Complaining of Neglect.=

                                                  N----, March 4, 19--.

  Peter Stirling, Esq.,
    City.

  DEAR SIR:--

About three weeks ago, I called your attention to the state of the
plumbing in this house, but no notice has been taken of my letter.
Unless you send some one at once to attend to this matter, I shall
have no alternative but to apply to the Health Department, and whatever
they consider necessary I shall have done and charged to you.

Hoping that you will not force me to resort to such extreme measures,

                                                  I remain,
                                                      Yours obediently,
                                                       ARTHUR APPLETON.


=79. Answer to the Above.=

                                                  N----, March 5, 19--.

  Arthur Appleton, Esq.,
    City.

  DEAR SIR:--

I sincerely regret to hear that the repairs you require have not as
yet been attended to. Owing to the late severe frost, it is almost
impossible to find enough plumbers for the amount of work required at
the present moment; however, I have requested my architect to send some
one round to-morrow to ascertain the extent of the damage, and to start
work at once. Hoping this will prove satisfactory,

                                                I remain,
                                                    Yours respectfully,
                                                        PETER STIRLING.

Furnished House.=

                                                  C----, April 5, 19--.

  Messrs. Lord & Williams,
    City.

  DEAR SIRS:--

I have been over the house on P---- Avenue you sent me a visiting
permit for, and should be glad to know if you think the owner would be
disposed to accept $75 per month on consideration of my being willing
to take the house for six months, providing the enclosed list of
articles which I consider necessary are supplied.

                                                      Yours faithfully,

  Messrs. Smith & Brown,
    City.

  GENTLEMEN:--

I wish you would put my house on your books, as I desire to let it
immediately, if possible for two or three years. I enclose particulars
of number of rooms, rent required, etc. Hoping to hear from you soon,

                                                      I remain,
                                                       Yours truly,

Rent.=

                                                N----, August 14, 19--.

  DEAR SIR:--

Have you any small residences on your books in the neighborhood of
Central Park, at from $125 to $150 per month? If so, will you send me
particulars concerning them, with permits to visit? I should like to
take a home for one year in that neighborhood if I can find one to suit
me.

                                                 Yours truly,
                                                       HENRIETTA MOORE.


=83. To a Real Estate Firm Asking Information About a Farm.=

                                                  C----, July 20, 19--.

  Messrs. Washburne & Smedley,
    S----.

  GENTLEMEN:--

I am informed that you have charge of large tracts of farming land in
your State. My friend, Mr. George Porter, of this city, who is also,
I understand, a friend of yours, suggests that you might be able to
find me just the thing I want. After fourteen years of exhausting
professional work in this place, I find myself thoroughly run down,
and my medical adviser insists that the only chance for me is to
break loose entirely from my present engagements, and either take
an extensive tour of travel, or enter on some light and pleasant
occupation that would serve to interest me without involving any
anxious care. In short, it is suggested that two years on a farm would
secure me a new lease of life. I think I have presented my case pretty
clearly. Country life, in a locality where I need not be far from home
and friends, attracts me more than does the traveling.

Do you know of a small farm that could be worked with comparative ease
and which I could rent or purchase? If so, I should be glad to hear
from you at your earliest convenience.

                                              Very truly yours,
                                                     GEORGE F. MONSELL.

                                                 P----, April 15, 19--.

  Messrs. Silverton & Co.,
    City.

  GENTLEMEN:--

I want to have the outside of my house painted, and I shall be obliged
if you will send a responsible person to call on me regarding this
matter, and to give an estimate of the cost. I shall also be glad to
know if you can undertake to complete the work in the course of next
week. A prompt answer will be appreciated,

                                                  Yours truly,
                                                        EDWARD SIMPSON.


=85. From a Gentleman to a Firm of House Decorators, Asking for Time to
Settle His Account.=

  Messrs. Gold, Ruby & Co.,
    City.

  GENTLEMEN:--

I am really sorry that I am unable to settle the whole of your bill
to-day; but I send you a check for $25 on account and will endeavor to
let you have the balance, $73.31, on the 21st of next month.

                                                  Yours truly,

    New York.

  GENTLEMEN:--

Enclosed you will find a money order for four dollars ($4), for which
please send to my address a copy of "Harpers Magazine" for one year,
beginning with the first number of the present volume.

                                                    Yours respectfully,

  Baggage Master C. B. & Q. R. R. Co.
    Union Depot, City.

  DEAR SIR:--

On arriving here from N---- this evening over your line, by the 7:20
train, I gave my check to the Local Express Co.'s agent, and he has
just reported that a large leather portmanteau is missing. I left C----
on Wednesday, by the 6:30 train, and saw my baggage checked for D----,
over your road. I hold your check No. 27,131. Kindly trace the missing
article by telegraph, and have it forwarded without delay, as I need
it badly. It bears my initial letters, C. S., and has also a parchment
label marked with my name.

                                                    I am, Sir,
                                                      Yours faithfully,

Mrs. Dudley has received Miss French's account, and is sorry to find
that it is considerably higher than she had expected. She will call and
see Miss French early next week respecting two or three items which
require explanation.


=89. From a Lady to a Dressmaker Postponing the Settlement of an
Account.=

                                                N----, January 8, 19--.

Mrs. Selborn is sorry she cannot send Miss Jackson a check by return
mail as requested, but hopes to be able to do so in the course of the
next ten days. She had not forgotten Miss Jackson's account, and is
only sorry that she has been obliged to keep her waiting such a long
time for full settlement.


=90. From a Gentleman to His Tailor.=

  Mr. Shears,                                  D----, December 18, 19--.
    City.

  DEAR SIR:--

The Prince Albert coat you sent me yesterday is a misfit in every way.
It is too large across the shoulders, tight under the arms, narrow
in the chest; the sleeves also are too short, and the collar is full
of wrinkles. Considering that I was measured for it, and that it was
subsequently tried on, there is no excuse for its fitting so badly. I
have this morning returned it to you, and if the alterations are not
made to my satisfaction, I shall of course decline to keep the garment.

                                             Yours faithfully,
                                                    ALFRED SANDRINGHAM.

    D----.

  DEAR SIR:--

Understanding that a vacancy in the faculty of your school has
occurred, I beg leave to offer myself as a candidate for the position.

I am 20 years old, a widower with one child. Am a graduate of O----
State Normal School, and have taught successfully for five years.
Please find enclosed a copy of my certificate from the County
Superintendent of----.

Would be willing to teach for the first year at a salary of $1,000.

If you can give me any encouragement, I shall be pleased to make
personal application.

                                                    Yours respectfully,
                                                         HAROLD STRONG.

  To Whom It May Concern:--

Having learned that Mr. Harold Strong is about to leave this State
to engage in the work of teaching in ---- State, I am pleased to say,
that I have known him for over five years, that his character is above
reproach, and that he has shown himself possessed of scholarship, tact,
enthusiasm, ability to keep discipline; in short, of all the highest
qualities of the successful teacher.

I, therefore, earnestly recommend him to any who desire to employ
a competent instructor, feeling confident that he will satisfy all
reasonable expectations.

                                                   B----, July 6, 19--.

  Henry T. Turner, Esq.

  DEAR SIR:--

This morning, I received the enclosed letter from Messrs. Barnes &
Butler, Mr. White's lawyers, asking for compensation for damage done
to his bicycle by its coming into collision with my automobile. I will
send my driver to you tomorrow morning that he may explain the nature
of the accident, and I think you will see that no blame attaches to
him. Will you have the goodness, after you have seen him, to write to
Messrs. Barnes & Butler to this effect?

                                                  Believe me,
                                                      Yours very truly,
                                                         MAY WILKINSON.


=94. From a Lady to a Lawyer Concerning a Bill of Costs.=

                                               C----, January 20, 19--.

  Robert Hazard, Esq.,
    Counselor-at-Law,
      City.

  DEAR SIR:--

Please find enclosed my check for $126.25, in full discharge of all
claims against me up to date, according to your bill, which I enclose
and desire you to return to me receipted.

With regard to incurring further costs of any kind, I beg to say that I
do not intend doing so; neither do I wish to take up your valuable time
in correspondence at my expense.

                                                 I remain,
                                                    Yours respectfully,
                                                          EVELYN STORY.

CHAPTER III

PRIVATE BUSINESS

_We include under this head, letters on matters of business between
parties that do not belong to the world of affairs._


=95. Asking a Friend to Make a Purchase for the Writer.=

                                                 T----, April 21, 19--.

  My Dear Miss Clancy:--

Will it impose too much upon your kindness to ask you to attend to a
little business for me?

I want to buy a nice wrap, and I have no idea what people are wearing
just now. I seldom go to town, as you know, and there are no styles to
study in these parts; indeed, we are very primitive as regards dress,
and I do not like to trust entirely to fashion plates, for fear of
ordering something exaggerated.

Your taste is excellent, and you know so exactly what is most suitable
to my figure and height, that I should feel more than satisfied if you
would choose a coat for me at about $45, for which I enclose a check.

Have you been buying anything pretty this spring? I know you are a
great authority on dress, and I suppose you brought home some exquisite
gowns from Paris. Are the hats as large as ever? and what will be the
favorite color this season?

We are as usual very quiet down here; but I am going to pay a few
visits in the northern part of the State, next month.

Believe me, dear Miss Clancy, with many thanks in advance,

                                                  Affectionately yours,
                                                       EVELYN T. INNES.
P. S.--I enclose measurements.


=96. From a Lady Asking a Friend to Visit Furnished Houses for Rent.=

                                               P----, January 10, 19--.

  Dear Mrs. Durant:--

We are thinking of coming to visit the city for the rest of the winter,
if we can find a small furnished house to suit us. Messrs. Roberts
& Higgins, Real Estate Agents, of---- B'way, have sent me several
particulars of houses, which they highly recommend.

Would you be so very kind as to go over and examine for me two houses
for which I have received visiting permits (enclosed), and tell me your
opinion of them; whether they are fairly well furnished, and thoroughly
clean--I mean as regards bedding, etc.

They ask a very moderate rent--$30 per week--so that I do not expect
too much in the way of furniture and carpets, and I shall be satisfied
if you could give a satisfactory report as to the general condition of
things in either of these houses.

It would be a real favor if you would do this for me, as I am anxious
to avoid the journey to town which personal attention to this matter
would entail.

Thanking you warmly in advance, and hoping that we shall see a great
deal of each other next winter,

                                                   Believe me, as ever,
                                                      Very truly yours,
                                                      HARRIET BILLINGS.


=97. From a Lady to a Friend, Asking Her to Engage Rooms at the
Sea-shore.=

                                                  C----, June 15, 19--.

  Dear Mrs. Johnson:--

We have almost decided to spend two months at Long Branch, and I should
much prefer taking furnished apartments to going to a hotel. I thought
perhaps you might be able to recommend us some rooms where we should
be comfortable. If not, would you mind the trouble of making a few
inquiries?

We should like to face the sea if possible, and require a sitting-room
and three bed-rooms, with private bath. I suppose the rent would be
about $25 per week.

Should you see any rooms likely to suit, would you engage them for us
from the 1st of July for eight weeks certain? I fear the place will
be very full, and that without your help we should have no little
difficulty on our arrival in securing desirable accommodation.

I hope we shall have fine weather during our stay at the sea-shore, and
see a great deal of you all.

With our united kind regards, believe me,

                                            Very sincerely your friend,
                                                         ELLEN BROOKES.


=98. From a Lady to a Lawyer Requesting His Immediate Attendance upon
Her Father.=

                                              B----, February 14, 19--.

  Henry T. Turner, Esq.

  DEAR SIR:--

My father requests me to ask you to call upon him this afternoon, if
convenient, on urgent business; he seems very anxious, and begged me to
lose no time in sending the message.

                                                      Faithfully yours,
                                                         MAY WILKINSON.


=99. From a Lady to a Medical Man, Requesting His Immediate Attendance.=

                                                G----, August 10, 19--.

  Dear Dr. Stanley:--

My little girl is suffering from a severe sore throat. I shall be glad
if you will call and see her this forenoon. I feel very anxious about
her, and am afraid I ought to have sent for you yesterday.

                                             Very truly yours,
                                                    EVELYN G. DINSMORE.


=100. From a Lady to a Medical Man, Asking for His Account.=

                                                G----, October 3, 19--.

Mrs. Dinsmore presents her compliments to Dr. Stanley, and wishes
to know the amount she is indebted to him for his attendance on her
daughter, as she is going to leave G----, in a few days.


=101. To a Gentleman Concerning a Note the Writer has Indorsed for Him.=

                                                O----, January 9, 19--.

  My Dear Robinson:--

I was persuaded to indorse a note for you on the clear understanding
that the money would be forthcoming at the time agreed upon, and that I
should hear nothing more regarding it. I yesterday received notice from
a Mr. Wilson, whom I do not know, that the note has been presented at
your bank, but payment refused, and I have, of course, been compelled
to pay it at once, at great inconvenience to myself. You will have the
goodness to attend to this matter immediately, and, allow me to add,
you had no right to deceive me in this way.

                                                    Yours truly,
                                                          MARTIN LLOYD.


=102. Requesting a Loan from a Friend.=

                                              N----, December 10, 19--.

  My Dear Williams:--

May I ask a favor of you, with the hope that you will be able to grant
it? I have a most pressing need for $300. Do you think you could oblige
me with that sum for a couple of months, when I shall refund the amount
promptly? I feel the greatest reluctance in making this request, and
only the extreme urgency of the case induces me to do so, although I
feel that, if it is in your power to serve me, you certainly will not
hesitate to do so.

  Believe me, dear Williams,
  Ever yours,
  HARRY DENISON.


=103. Answer to the Above.=

                                              N----, December 12, 19--.

  My Dear Denison:--

I hasten to answer your note of Saturday, which reached my desk this
a.m. Nothing would have done me greater pleasure than to come to your
assistance to the full amount requested. But I am pretty hard up
myself, especially toward the end of the year. Still, I don't feel like
leaving an old friend in a hole, and I beg you to accept the loan of
the $100 enclosed, to be returned at your convenience.

I trust that all are well at home. Hoping to see you soon, well and
hearty,

                                                I remain,
                                                   Your sincere friend,
                                                      PHILLIP WILLIAMS.


=104. Asking a Relative for a Temporary Loan.=

                                              P----, December 10, 19--.

  My Dear Bess:--

I am in great financial trouble at the present moment, being
unexpectedly called upon to pay a heavy bill of costs to my lawyers,
which they demand in a rather threatening manner. You know that I
recently lost an important suit which I found among the assets (?) of
my poor Harry. The bill amounts to $357, and they ask for this amount
within ten days. I am unable to meet this heavy sum just now, and I
write to ask if you would be so very kind as to lend me $125.

You may depend upon my repaying you as soon as my late husband's
affairs are straightened out; although, I must say, the resources
left me, after all just debts shall have been settled, will be
possibly inadequate to meet my many expenses, which renders this, may
I say extortionate, demand the harder to submit to; but in the hands
of lawyers one feels helpless and powerless. At least this is my
experience of the profession.

I do trust you may be able to grant my request. I shall be sincerely
grateful to you for any assistance you can give me.

                                           Believe me,
                                              Your affectionate cousin,
                                                          MABEL DWIGHT.


=105. From a Lady to Another Concerning a Furnished Country House.=

                                                N----, August 15, 19--.

Mrs. Edwards presents her compliments to Mrs. Robbins; she understands
from her friend Mrs. Ludlow, that Briar Villa is to be let furnished
for next year's season--from May to November--, and she thinks from the
description it would be very likely to suit her; perhaps Mrs. Robbins
will let Mrs. Edwards know when it will be convenient for her to see it.


=106. Answer to the Above.=

                                                 B----, August 6, 19--.

Mrs. Robbins presents her compliments to Mrs. Edwards, and begs to
thank her for her note respecting her house, but she has already
received an offer for it, which she is disposed to accept. However,
should the matter fall through, she will let Mrs. Edwards know at once.


=107. From a Young Lady Desirous of Securing Farm-House Board.=

                                                   S----, May 27, 19--.

  Mrs. Silas Marner,
    The Uplands Farm, B---- Lake, Minn.

  DEAR MADAM:--

I have had charge for four years of the millinery department in one of
the largest dry goods establishments in this city. During that period
it has never seemed convenient for me to take a vacation. The time has
at last come when I must seek full relaxation; although not an invalid,
I am dreadfully run down. The doctor prescribes immediate and thorough
rest. He says I do not require medicine, but a month in a quiet home,
where I shall have pure air, plain food and no worry. Miss Etheridge,
who is a friend of mine, and was a neighbor of yours until she came to
S----, says the Uplands Farm is the very place for me, and that you
are just the kindly friend I need to make a month of peace and quiet
a season of perfect delight. I write, therefore, to ask if you could
find room for me in your hospitable home, and on what terms. I promise
to give you little trouble, for I am not an invalid, nor am I given to
"fine city ways," or full of foolish fancies. I want perfect freedom
from care and worry; to sleep, to read, to ramble in the woods and
meadows; anything to give my poor, tired mind and body four weeks of
unbroken rest. Miss Etheridge will write by this mail, and I shall be
glad to hear from you at your earliest convenience, as I should like to
begin my vacation about June 17.

                                                      I am, dear madam,
                                                           Yours truly,
                                                           SELMA WHITE.


=108. Answer to the Above.=

  The Uplands Farm,
                                        B---- Lake, Minn. May 29, 19--.

  My Dear Miss White:--


I was a little surprised to find two letters awaiting me at the post
office this morning. I am afraid our mutual friend, Miss Etheridge, has
been drawing a little upon her imagination.

We are a very plain sort of people at the Uplands Farm, as she knows
right well. Still, if simple living, fresh air, and perfect rest is
what you require, I think we can accommodate you. B---- Lake is within
walking distance, and the whole neighborhood is very beautiful. If
$---- for the month's board meets your views, I think I could undertake
to entertain you, with the hope of providing what you desire.

Pray give my kind regards to Miss Etheridge.

                                                      Yours very truly,
                                                          SUSAN MARNER.


=109. From a Lady Desirous of Placing a Sick Child at a Farm House.=

                                                   D----, May 17, 19--.

  Mrs. Matthew Jones,
    The Hollands Farm, W----.

  DEAR MADAM:--

My little girl, Mary, who is just 11 years old, has been growing much
too fast for her health. The doctor says there is nothing at all the
matter with her, and that she has a splendid constitution, but thinks
a little special attention just now would be of great advantage to her
through life, and he, therefore, suggests that she spend the coming
summer at a farm house, where she would have the benefit of a simple
fare and of living almost entirely in the open air.

Mary is not an invalid, nor even in delicate health. If you could make
it convenient to board her for the summer, I should esteem it a great
favor. You are not very far from D----, so Mary could occasionally
visit her home and some of us could come out and visit her; in that way
she would not probably be troubled with homesickness. She is a good,
obedient child, and would give you little trouble. I shall be glad to
hear from you at your earliest convenience.

                                                  I remain, dear madam,
                                                    Yours truly,
                                                        AGNES WILLIAMS.


=110. Answer to the Above.=

  The Hollands Farm,
                                                   W----, May 20, 19--.

  My Dear Mrs. Williams:--

Your letter of the 17th to hand. I think I could make room for your
daughter during the summer if, as your letter indicates, she would
be perfectly content with plain living and the simple comforts of a
farmhouse. I find my second daughter, Sophia, is already acquainted
with your little girl, having met her on two or three occasions at
D---- during the Christmas holidays of last year. This would make it
pleasant for both children.

As to details, since you are not more than two or three hours' ride
from us, would it not be well if you could make the short journey?
Matters could be settled so much easier by an interview than by letters.

                                                        I am,
                                                           Yours truly,
                                                           ALICE JONES.


=111. From a Lady to a Teacher of Music.=

Mrs. Howland would be obliged if Signor Leonti would let her know the
terms for a course of twelve lessons at her own residence; perhaps
Signor Leonti would make it convenient to call upon her any morning
during this week before 1 o'clock, when he would be able to judge of
the progress her daughter has already made.

C----, May 7, 19--.


=112. Answer to the Above.=

Signor Leonti presents his compliments to Mrs. Howland, and begs to
say that his terms are $5 per lesson of forty-five minutes, at pupil's
home; he makes no reduction for a course of lessons. He will have the
honor of calling on Mrs. Howland on Thursday morning at 11.

C----, May 8, 19--.


=113. To an Artist Concerning a Portrait.=

Mrs. Donaldson is very desirous of having a portrait of her husband
painted by Monsieur Carolus. Will he therefore kindly appoint the most
convenient hour to receive her at his studio, when the price of the
portrait, the number of sittings to be given, and other details can be
discussed.

N----, March 17, 19--.


=114. From a Lady Asking Private Reformation about a School.=

                                                  N----, June 10, 19--.

  Dear Mrs. Beamans:--

Will you allow me to ask you a few questions respecting a school kept
by the Misses Primley. I understand your little girl is one of their
pupils. Are you thoroughly satisfied with the system of education
followed at this school, and are the domestic arrangements with regard
to comfort and living all that you could wish? My little girl is rather
delicate, and requires care. Do you think she would be happy in the
Misses Primley's charge, and is your daughter likely to remain with
them beyond this term? I should feel grateful for any confidential
particulars you could give me on this to me most important subject, and
hope you will kindly excuse my troubling you with these inquiries.

                                                Thanking you in advance
                                                   I remain,
                                                      Very truly yours,
                                                        EDITH CARRLYON.


=115. Answer to the Above.=

                                                  N----, June 12, 19--.

  Dear Mrs. Carrlyon:--

You ask if my daughter is to remain at S---- beyond this term. I am
seriously thinking of having her home at once, as she has not been
at all well lately, and I doubt if the confinement of school hours
altogether agrees with her. I can hardly express an opinion with
respect to the progress she has made in her studies, as she has been
there so short a time. I believe the living is fairly good, but, as you
know, delicate children require especial care and attention. The Misses
Primley's school was not personally recommended to me by any friend of
mine; it came to my notice simply through an advertisement. I shall be
glad to hear that these few lines have been of some service to you.

                                                   Believe me, as ever,
                                                      Very truly yours,
                                                      CARLOTTA BEAMANS.

    _Dear Readers,

                This is a sample of business writing, written easily
    and rapidly, with the combined movement and a coarse pointed pen.

    It is as simple as is consistent with ease and legibility and can
    be written continuously, for any length of time, without fatigue.

    This style is the natural outcome from the study and practice of
    the standard forms.

                                                   Very truly,

      Kind letters, that display the heart's deep history,
    In which we feel the pressure of a hand--
      One touch of fire--all the rest is mystery."
                                                  --_H. W. Longfellow._

    "Every day brings a ship,
    Every ship brings a word;
    Well for those who have no fear,
    Looking seaward well assured
    That the word the vessel brings
    Is the word they wish to hear."
                                                     --_R. W. Emerson._

The nineteenth century is the grandest of all the centuries of time.
It has done more for the education, the culture and the comfort of the
world than all the ages that have gone before. Schools, seminaries and
colleges have increased to an almost fabulous extent. With the increase
in numbers there has been also an increase in efficiency and influence
to such an extent that our institutions of education have become the
glory of our land. In the eventful years of this century science has
marched on with majestic strides, revealing to the earnest student the
long-kept secrets of nature; while the spirit of invention has been
busy through all the years making the path of life easier to walk,
and redeeming our common life from much of its hardship and drudgery.
The railway, the steamship, the telegraph and the telephone are hard
at work bridging over space, and making minutes sufficient for tasks
that not long ago required months to perform. The printing press is
regarded by common consent as one of the greatest inventions the world
has ever seen. It has been described not inaptly as the miracle of the
fifteenth century. But within the last few years the typewriter has
come to claim a share in its honors, and to take its place among the
most wonderful contrivances of the age.

It would seem as though letter-writing, which half a century ago was
a luxury and a delight, is about to become a lost art, a mere memory
of days of happy leisure. Before the advent of Sir Rowland Hill, and
the establishment of that wonder of our civilization, the modernized
post office, men and women of education occupied their leisure hours in
writing long, delightful letters to their friends.

It is interesting to note that much of the most admirable literature
of the eighteenth century took the form of letters. The best critics
and essayists of that time, such men as Addison, and Steele, and Pope
were aptly described as "men of letters." The severest and most caustic
political strictures ever written were "The Letters of Junius," though
who "Junius" was remains a secret, and will probably remain so to the
end of time.

But the world moves on! The days of leisure are passed, and a
busier age demands quicker methods. In answer to this demand the
writing-machines have appeared. These marvelous labor-saving inventions
have already wrought a revolution in our commercial life, and they
bid fair to put an end to letter-writing in all branches of commerce
and in clerical professions generally. Yet, as long as the world
lasts letter writing will hold an important place; indeed, it will
always be a part of our best life. Business even will sometimes assume
such importance, and involve so many intricate details, that it will
seem that nothing short of a long and carefully written letter, in
which the individuality of the writer appears in the character of his
hand-writing, will fully serve the purpose of the occasion.

There is something formal and official inseparable from a type-written
letter. Type-written letters are more or less all alike, they have no
individuality, are marked by no personal characteristics; while, on the
other hand, no two letters from the pens of different writers are ever
alike. A firm may send a dozen type-written letters on some important
subject, with little or no result. But if the head of some department,
or better still, the head of the firm himself, with his own hand, write
a letter, then the matter is sure to receive prompt attention. Indeed,
any matter of more than ordinary importance is surely well worth the
trouble of a written letter.

In more intimate intercourse, the hand-written letter still reigns
supreme. The mother does not want a machine-written letter from her
son. Type-written letters might be from some other son to some other
mother. She wants to see her son's hand-writing, for to her loving
eyes, his angular, awkward, and even misspelt, letters are a thousand
times more beautiful and symmetrical than any letter any typewriter
ever produced. What ardent lover would care to receive a type-written
letter? Do not lovers fondly linger, and dote, and dream over the very
characters wrought by the hand they love so well? A letter from a
lover's hand is a revelation that no machine-written letter can ever
be. Besides all this, are there not dottings of i's and crossings of
t's, and countless twists, and turns, and underlinings, all full to the
brim of mystic meanings that no typewriter on earth could convey?

[Illustration]

There are other things, moreover, that it would show very poor taste to
commit to the typewriter. Such, for example, as letters of condolence
or congratulation. No thoughtful, cultured person would send a letter
of condolence to a mother who had lost a child, or a letter of
congratulation on a wedding anniversary, written on a machine! It would
be as far from good taste as though sent from a printing office in
printed form.

Who would have cared to have received type-written letters from the
brave boys who were fighting the battles of freedom thirty years ago?
What treasures those letters were! Written from the battle-fields,
on scraps of paper, with the drum head for a desk. Written in haste
while "the foe was suddenly firing"; crumpled, blotted, and sometimes
stained with blood. How the mothers and sweethearts kissed the
precious missives, and even sturdy fathers were not ashamed of tears!
The straggling, imperfect penmanship was beautiful, seen by the eyes
of love. While love and tenderness endure, love letters and letters
sent home must be written by the hand, for there is often as much
impressiveness in the form of a letter as in the accents of the voice.
In short, good and careful letter-writing will always form an important
element in a liberal education. A gentleman is nowhere so much a
gentleman as in his letters.

It would be a good thing for Young America to take to heart the thought
that the debts of personal correspondence are very sacred obligations.
It is a cheap and easy thing to say that the friendship that cannot
last without periodical letters had better die; but if friendship is
worth having, if friendship is more than a name, it is surely worth
keeping and guarding, when all that is asked to keep the fires upon
its altars aflame is an occasional kindly letter. Thoughtlessness in
this direction is unkindness, and especially in the matter of letters
for the home circle. The "exile from home," in far-away lands, finds
a letter from home as cheering and refreshing as a fountain in a dry
desert land. And in like manner, the home-circle, and especially the
mother's heart, is made strong and glad, and goes comforted for many a
day by a kindly letter, however brief, from the absent and the loved.

    "Write soon!" Oh, sweet request of truth,
      How tenderly its accents come!
    We heard it first in early youth,
      When mothers watched us leaving home.

    And still, amid the trumpet joys,
      That weary us with pomp and show,
    We turn from all this brassy noise
      To hear this minor cadence flow.

    We part, but carry on our way
      Some loved one's plaintive spirit-tune,
    That as we wander, seems to say--
      Affection lives on faith--"Write soon!"




CHAPTER II

BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN


=116. To a Son Entering Business.=

                                                 L----, April 27, 19--.

My Dear George:--

The fact that your school days are ended and that you are about to
enter on the real business of life, is a matter of deep interest to me,
as well as of great importance to yourself. I am not disposed to preach
a sermon to you, but a few words of good advice will not come amiss
just now. All I want to say to-day I can compress into three very brief
sentences. Be truthful. Be honest. Be manly. The man who is truthful in
spirit as well as in letter, who is so thoroughly honest that he will
neither steal nor take an unfair advantage, who is upright and manly in
all his dealings, is the man who, in the long run, wins competence and
honor. Let the Golden Rule be a guide for you through life. A sentiment
from Shakespeare may fitly close this brief letter:

    "To thine own self be true;
    And it must follow as the night the day,
    Thou can'st not then be false to any man."

God bless and prosper you in all your ways.

                                                     Your affectionate,
                                                                FATHER.


=117. From a Son to his Father Offering to Leave College.=

  H---- College,
                                               H----, February 2, 19--.

Dear Father:--

You had told me enough of your affairs during my visit at home to
prepare me somewhat for the news contained in your last letter. I
hope even yet that means may be found by which you can meet your
obligations. I shall be proud if I can be of any service to you at
this critical time, but whether I can or not, I shall not be satisfied
unless I make the effort. I want your approval in what I propose. You
have, with much sacrifice I know, given me a year and a half of college
life. I can never tell how much it has meant to me. Whatever I may
be able to do for you now will not repay the debt of gratitude I owe
you. The semi-annual examinations are just over, so that now is a very
convenient time to break off here. I want to go straight to work. With
energy and perseverance I can find something to do. Please write me at
once that you consent, and give me any advice that occurs to you. I
would suggest that I go to Uncle Henry's in C----, and keep his books
evenings for my board, as he proposed last fall. I know of nothing
new in his circumstances that would have caused him to change his
mind about wanting me. I have written to him, and I look for a reply
to-morrow morning. If he is willing to take me, and you think well of
the plan, there will be nothing to prevent my going at once. In a city
like C----, there must be plenty of employment for a willing, active
young man, of fair ability and education, and good principles. What
I may be able to earn will perhaps help you a little in your present
difficulty; please, dear father, accept this offer from

                                              Your loving grateful son,
                                                                ALFRED.


=118. Answer to the Above.=

My Dear Boy:--

The generous spirit of your letter brought the tears to my eyes. I
know well how much it will cost you to give up, or even postpone your
college course. It will be hard to break off class associations, and
leave the work that you find so congenial. I wish I could thank you
for your noble offer, and tell you that we could worry through without
your help, but I find, that my affairs are in a worse condition than
intimated in my last letter. Have not given up hope yet, still cannot
conscientiously refuse any means of relief that comes to me. Go, my
dear son, to your Uncle Henry's, and God bless you. Am well-nigh
crushed by this trouble, but the thought of your manly attitude brings
me comfort and support. With God's help we shall pull through.

                                                      Your affectionate
                                                                FATHER.


=119. To a Mother from Her Daughter after First Day in College.=

  R---- College,
                                             R----, September 20, 19--.

Dear Mother:--

You have probably received by this time the postal card that I wrote
you while we were in the midst of unpacking. We have at last emerged
from chaos. I wish you could see our room--it is so cosy and inviting.

I have so many things to tell you that I hardly know where to begin.
"At the beginning," you will say. Very well. There was a gay crowd of
laughing, excited girls at the station when I arrived. Such kissing
and little shrieks and hugs! I felt quite left out in the cold. We all
piled into the college bus together. It was a drive of two miles to the
college buildings, and the scenery along the way was perfectly lovely.
After we had arrived I was standing quite forsaken in the great main
hall watching people who seemed entirely at home pass back and forth or
gather in little knots, when a girl came up to me and said: "You are a
new girl, are you not? If you will tell me your name I will show you
to your room." Have since found out that the sophomores have charge
of looking after the freshmen, and this girl was a sophomore. When
she learned my name she went to the office to consult the directory,
and came back and took me to room 89, on the third floor. There was
a large bunch of daisies in a vase on the table. When I admired it,
she said, "That's the way we sophomores have of hazing the freshmen."
We had a long conversation, and she told me a great many things about
the college and what to expect, and finally she concluded, "Now, don't
forget, Miss Clarke, that I found you, and you sort of belong to me.
If, at any time, you desire any wise advice, or if you get into any
scrape and want to get out cleverly, why, call upon me. My name is Alma
Robertson, address No. 56, east corridor, 2d floor. You know you can't
do much till you've seen Prexy, so you'd better get your number as soon
as you can."

I discovered before long what she meant. There were about ten girls
waiting in the outer office of the President. Some one handed me a
square of paper marked 53. "No. 17 is closeted now," a girl told
me, "and I am No. 18." So I went back to my room to wait--no longer
_my_ room, however, but _our_ room, for there I found my room mate.
She is perfectly lovely. Her name is Elizabeth Gyllane. She is a
sophomore, and the friend from her own class whom she expected to room
with her had not returned to college. I know Elizabeth was very much
disappointed, but she made me feel at once that she was pleased with
the arrangement made for her, and she was as sweet as could be to me.
She is one of the most tactful and unselfish persons I ever met. She is
from Virginia, and speaks with a southern accent. She has no mother. Do
you think that is why she likes so much to hear about my own? She says
she has a very clear impression of you already, and almost loves you.
I never got acquainted with any one so quickly before. She understands
exactly what you mean and how you feel, and you don't have to explain
things.

Every girl has to take an hour's exercise a day. You can walk or you
are allowed to row in the wide flat-bottomed boats, if you can prove to
the authorities that one is not strong enough to capsize them.

We have not had regular recitations yet, but our lessons are all
assigned for to-morrow. I had no idea I should dread it as I do. All
the girls I have met have such a superior, learned air--not at all like
the high-school girls. I have a perfect horror of being considered
stupid.

Elizabeth and I are going for a row at 3 o'clock this afternoon. She
has a great many friends who are always coming to see her and making
plans that include her, but she told me this morning that she wanted me
to go out with her this afternoon--"just we two alone," she said, "for
a nice long time together."

I don't know what I should do without her. Last evening I felt so
lonely and homesick. I was thinking of you and papa and the baby,
and how long it would be before I should see my beloved ones again.
Elizabeth found me in our bedroom on the bed, and she was just
splendid. She didn't try to jolly me up, but instead she was very
serious, and talked with me about my home. She put her arm about me and
said, "Alice, your kind of homesickness is a blessed thing. One may be
homesick because one has no home to be homesick for." I wondered if
she meant herself, but I didn't say anything, for fear of making her
feel badly. But I thought how very selfish I was to be accepting her
sympathy when perhaps she needed sympathy more than I did.

Please give my dearest love to papa, and ask baby not to forget "Lala."

I am sure I am going to be very happy here, dear mother, although the
homesick feeling takes possession of me every once in a while. It seems
already as if I had not seen you for half a year.

You must have been very tired after I left home, you had worked so hard
helping me get ready. I find I have everything I need, and my clothes
look beautifully. I can never thank you enough for all you have done
for me, and are doing for me. I know you will say that the best thanks
I can offer is to make the most of my opportunities, and I shall try
not to disappoint you.

                                            Your affectionate daughter,
                                                                 MABEL.


=120. Answer to the Above.=

                                             B----, September 23, 19--.

Dear Mabel:--

Your long, interesting letter was duly received. We are very glad to
have a clear idea of your new life, and to know that everything opens
up so pleasantly. Elizabeth seems to be a very lovely girl, of fine
sensibility and womanly character, and I hope sometime we may all know
her. She is evidently trying to make your first few days of college
life happy ones, and in order to reciprocate her unselfish thought
for you, you must have your eyes open to see her needs and wishes. I
have regretted that you had no sister of your own age to share your
room with you at home, for experience teaches one many lessons in the
art of being an ideal room-mate--for it is an art. Perfect breeding,
delicacy of perception that will keep one from ever being intrusive,
adaptability in little things, orderly habits, responsiveness,
sympathy, unselfishness, loyalty, are the qualities to be cultivated by
one who desires to be at all times an entirely agreeable room-mate, and
these you have, my child, all in more or less degree, I believe: but
you are apt to be thoughtless, and you will need to exercise care and
self-control. I believe that the friendships you form at college with
your classmates and teachers are as important as the studies you are
pursuing. This does not imply that you should ever neglect your lessons
for social enjoyment. I am sure you have too much good sense to draw
such a conclusion.

Your father and I are very anxious that you should derive much culture
and good mental training from your college course. As far as you can
command your own motives, study for the knowledge and the discipline to
be derived, rather than for marks or class standing. The higher one's
aim, the more permanent will be the result.

It is hard to become used to your being away, my precious child. The
house is lonely without you. But it is for your good, and I am so
thankful that we can give you this opportunity that I do not grumble.
It is a comfort to us to be able to remember that you have always been
a good daughter. We love to recall your pleasant ways, and the many
proofs of your earnest purpose to do right.

Write to us freely, and tell us of your successes and your
difficulties, for we shall want to know all that concerns you.

Gertrude has been to the house to inquire what we have heard from you.
She will be delighted to have you write to her. You must not forget
your old friends in making new ones. Aunt Mary, also, will appreciate a
nice letter from you.

The baby wanted to write "Bebel," so I gave her paper and pencil, and
she insists upon my enclosing her scrawl. Good-bye, my darling. God
bless you. Father says: "Tell Mabel I love her."

                                                      Your affectionate
                                                                MOTHER.


=121. From a Son to His Father, Excusing His Extravagance.=

                                              H----, December 20, 19--.

Dear Father:--

I can never thank you enough for your kind, indulgent letter. I am
deeply sorry to have occasioned you so much anxiety, and am most
grateful to you for your timely aid. Believe me, in the future I will
endeavor to give you no further cause for complaint, and I only regret
that I should have allowed myself to be led into such thoughtless
extravagance. You may depend upon my following your advice, and proving
myself worthy of your generous kindness.

                                          I am, dear father,
                                                 Your affectionate son,
                                                                 HARRY.


=122. From a Mother to Her Daughter on Her Birthday.=

                                                 E----, April 25, 19--.

My Darling Edith:--

I have planned that this letter should reach you on the morning of
the 27th, which is your sixteenth birthday. Your father, brothers and
sisters desire me to speak for them, and to say how sincerely we send
you a thousand good wishes on this happy day. If only you could have
been at home with us, that we might have had one of those old-time
festivals! But, dear daughter, the path of duty demands many sacrifices
of us all. You are where it is best for you to be, fitting yourself for
the serious but delightful duties that must sooner or later demand your
attention.

A little box, which I hope has reached you safely, contains some
trifling tokens of affection from each one of us, which I know you
will appreciate to the full. The box also contains the materials for a
pleasant little entertainment, which, I have no doubt, Mrs. Dash will
allow you to give to your school-fellows, as I have written to beg a
half holiday for the occasion.

God bless you, my dear Edith, and may every succeeding year find you
increasing in all that is wise, in understanding and in beauty of
character, is the earnest prayer of

                                                      Your affectionate
                                                                MOTHER.


=123. From a Son to His Father, Expressing Dislike of His Present
Occupation.=

                                                 C----, April 15, 19--.

Dear Father:--

I feel that you will be disappointed at what I am about to say, but,
after due consideration, hope you will not think I am altogether wrong
in frankly stating my dislike for office work. I have now been here
nearly six months, and find this employment as little to my taste as
when I first began. Have tried my best to form a liking for the work,
but am quite sure I shall never get on in this kind of occupation.

Should be very glad to talk the matter over with you; it is not that I
am afraid of work; am sure, however, that I shall never make a success
in a business which has no attraction for me.

I have given it a fair trial, and have put off writing to you on the
subject as long as possible; but as there is no chance of my changing
my mind, further delay would be useless. I shall hope to hear from you
in a day or two, dear father, and with love to all,

                                            Believe me,
                                                 Your affectionate son,
                                                                 HARRY.

                                                 C----, April 13, 19--.

My Dear Papa:--

I hope to see you soon, you have been away a very long time; when are
you coming back again? I have tried to be a good boy, and Miss Meriam
says I have been most attentive at my lessons. Dear mamma will send
this little letter with hers. I love you with all my heart.

                                          Your affectionate little son,
                                                                FREDDY.

                                                 C----, August 5, 19--.

Dear Grandpa:--

I hope you are enjoying good health, as usual. I wish you many happy
returns of your birthday, and I send you a little paper knife which I
bought with my own money, and I hope you will like it and use it; it
cuts beautifully. Carrie is going to send you a present also, but I
must not tell you what it is to be; she made it herself.

I am, dear grandpa, with much love,

                                            Your affectionate grandson,
                                                           FRED SELDEN.

                                                    C----, May 4, 19--.

Dear Uncle George:--

I can never thank you enough for the beautiful watch you sent me on my
birthday. Mamma says I may wear it, but I must not wind it up until I
am older, and she is going to do it every day herself for me. I have
learnt to tell the time by it; it is now a quarter past three, and we
are going out for a walk in the park; so good-bye, dear Uncle George.

We all send you our best love.

                                              Your affectionate nephew,
                                                           FRED SELDEN.

Dear Daisy:--

School closes on Thursday week. I hope my rabbits are well, and my pony
also. How is the garden looking? I will help you all I can in it when I
come home. We are going to have a baseball match with the high-school
boys, this afternoon; so good-bye. Give my love to all. I hope mamma
got my letter.

                                             Your affectionate brother,
                                                                 EDDIE.


=128. From a Little Girl at School to Her Mamma.=

                                               W----, October 19, 19--.

Dear Mamma:--

Am so sorry that Miss Peabody has had to complain of me, but I do try
to learn my very difficult lessons, and when I cannot do so I cry until
my head aches. Dear mamma, I wish you would allow me to put German
aside until next term, and then perhaps I should get on better with my
French lessons.

Please give my love to dear papa, and tell him I would not make him
unhappy if I could help it, but I have so much to learn every day,
and all the girls in my class are older than I am, and have been much
longer at school.

With lots of kisses for you, papa and puss,

                                       Your very affectionate daughter,
                                                                MAGGIE.

Darling Mother:--

We all miss you very, very much indeed, and hope to hear in your next
letter that grandma is almost well, and that you will be able to come
home in a day or two. Papa is writing to you by this post. I am going
out for a ride with him presently. Nurse says the children are very
good and happy. Lulu cried a little last night because she could not
say good-night to you, but she soon went to sleep while nurse told her
a pretty story about a good little girl who did everything her papa and
mamma wished. Good-bye, dear darling mother.

                                                  Your loving daughter,
                                                                KITTIE.

Dearest Mamma:--

Cousin Flora is writing to you, but I thought you would also like a
little letter from me. I am enjoying myself very much, every one is
so kind, but I must tell you all I have seen when I come home. I am
longing to see you, dear mamma, and with best love to you and dear
papa, I remain,

                                            Your affectionate daughter,
                                                                 SARAH.

My Dear Grandma:--

It was so delightfully kind of you to send me such a beautiful doll!
Mamma has given me a cradle to put it in at night, and I mean to take
it out walking with me every day. Dear mamma says the next time she
comes to see you she will bring me with her; I hope it will be soon;
don't you?

With best love, dear grandma, believe me, as ever,

                                       Your affectionate granddaughter,
                                                                HATTIE.

                                               B----, October 10, 19--.

Dear Charlie:--

You can't imagine how much I miss you. I have no one to play with me
now. How do you like being at school? are the lessons very difficult?
are there any nice boys like you? Do tell me all about it; what you
have for dinner, what hour you go to bed, and what games you play at,
and how long you are allowed to play.

Papa and mamma send their best love.

                                              Your affectionate sister,
                                                                  LULU.

CHAPTER III

TO AND FROM RELATIVES, GUARDIANS, ETC.


=133. From a Mother-in-Law to a Son-in-Law.=

                                              D----, November 12, 19--.

My Dear Alfred:--

I was delighted to hear such an excellent account of you all from
Alice; although it is some time since I have been to your house, still
I must always feel deeply interested in all that concerns you and yours.

Perhaps I was too hasty in concluding that the advice I offered would
offend you: I know, it is generally considered that a mother-in-law's
interference is never welcome, however reasonable may be her remarks;
but, believe me, dear Alfred, what I said was meant in good faith,
and I had no intention of censuring or criticising any arrangement of
yours. I should have expressed the same opinion to any friend of mine
under similar circumstances had I been consulted. The fact of your
being my son-in-law induced me to imagine that I might speak frankly to
you without fear of giving offence; indeed, I regard you as a son, and
you must not be too quick to resent words my motherly affection prompts
me to say.

With kindest love to Alice, yourself and my dear little grandchildren,

                                               Believe me,
                                                  Yours affectionately,
                                                            EMILY SHAW.


=134. From a Mother-in-Law to a Daughter-in-Law.=

                                              P----, December 30, 19--.

My Dear Maud:--

I have to tell you how much I enjoyed my little visit last week, the
first I have paid to your pretty new home, and I trust many years of
happiness are in store for you and my dear son. He tells me that he
has in you the most considerate and affectionate of wives: I sincerely
rejoice that it is so. I have seen so many unhappy marriages, rendered
such through thoughtlessness and extravagance on the part of the wife,
that nothing pleases me more than to think my boy is so fortunate
in his choice. His limited means call for the most careful domestic
management, and not a little self-denial, and it is so easy when first
commencing housekeeping to run into more expense than one's income
justifies; but this error I am sure you will carefully guard against,
always remembering what strict supervision is required in the smallest
domestic details.

I have learned this from experience, dear Maud, which I have found to
be the best, if not the most pleasant, of teachers.

With kindest love to yourself and my son,

                                                Believe me,
                                                  Yours affectionately,
                                                        MALVINA WRIGHT.

                                                C----, August 20, 19--.

Dear Mrs. Park:--

Edward and I are most anxious to know if you have returned home yet,
and how you have enjoyed your stay in the mountains. We received your
last letter dated July 31st, and have been a little surprised at not
hearing from you oftener.

I hardly know where to write to you, but suppose this letter will
follow you at the Summit House. Edward is pretty well, and is looking
forward to his vacation, which has been postponed this year on account
of extra work in the office, but we do not regret this, as we have had
such very stormy weather the last three weeks.

The children unite with me and Edward in love to dear grandmamma.

                                               Believe me, as ever,
                                                  Yours affectionately,
                                                         LILIAN DWIGHT.


=136. From a Daughter-in-Law to a Father-in-Law.=

                                              E----, February 10, 19--.

Dear Mr. Winthrop:--

We have been delighted to learn from your last letter that you
have been quite well in spite of the severe weather we have lately
experienced, and that you are in such good spirits. How wise not to let
the small worries of life depress you. I wish I had a little of your
philosophy; as it is, I take things too much to heart, and am inclined
to allow trifles to vex me. You set us all such a good example by your
unvaried cheerfulness.

I suppose you were very much interested in Tuesday's meeting, as you
are such a keen judge of politics; but will not express my opinion of
it, gathered second-hand from my husband, in case it should run counter
to yours. This you may call cowardice on my part, but it is really
discretion.

With kindest love from Ned, also myself, believe me, dear Mr. Winthrop,

                                                      Your affectionate
                                                        HILDA WINTHROP.


=137. From a Sister-in-Law to a Brother-in-Law.=

                                                C----, August 10, 19--.

My Dear Julius:--

As you doubtless know, from long personal experience, my husband is a
very bad correspondent, and has, I have discovered, allowed your last
kind letter to remain unanswered for nearly a month; so I will try and
take his place as far as possible, and ask you to accept me as his
substitute. Your news was most interesting to us both. You seem to have
had a very pleasant holiday; we quite envied you, and I very much wish
Horace could have gone along, if only for a week; but he is so hard
worked that there seems no chance of his having even a day's holiday
until the end of the season. He is, however, am happy to say, quite
well. I suppose you will be back about the end of the month; if my
advice is worth having, I should say do not make the long and fatiguing
return journey too quickly, but take a fair amount of rest on the way;
it is a great mistake to travel night and day after weeks of complete
repose and quiet, and is calculated to destroy most of the benefit
derived from change of climate and surroundings.

With kindest love,

                                               Believe me, dear Julius,
                                              Your affectionate sister,
                                                        EVA DILLINGHAM.


=138. From a Brother to a Married Sister Asking for Her Husband's
Influence.=

                                                  N----, June 14, 19--.

Dear Polly:--

You have doubtless asked yourself why I did not write to you lately;
the fact is, I have been rather out of spirits, besides being very much
occupied.

Am beginning to discover there is little chance of promotion where I am
now employed, and that it is almost time to look around for something
better. Do you think your husband might take any active interest in me,
and would you dislike speaking to him on the subject? I do not exactly
know the extent of his influence, or indeed if he possesses any, but
I thought from the responsible position he holds with Lombard Bros. &
Co., he might perhaps know of some opening that would suit me. I have
never as yet spoken to him about my own affairs, and if, on your part,
you feel any reluctance in mentioning the subject, pray do not hesitate
to tell me so.

Jack seems very happy at school, but is looking forward to spending his
holidays with you.

I suppose Mabel's marriage will take place in the autumn, from what she
says.

                                            With kind love, believe me,
                                             Your affectionate brother,
                                                           ERNEST RAND.


=139. From a Sister to an Elder Brother, about a Temporary Loan.=

  The Misses Sterling's School for Young Ladies,
                                                   S----, May 18, 19--.

My Dear Edward:--

I have an important favor to ask, which I trust you will grant, if it
can be done without any real inconvenience.

I have just received a very pressing invitation to go with Mrs. Hubbard
and her daughters to London and Paris; afterward to make a tour with
them in Switzerland. This would be quite a new experience for me,
as I have never yet been abroad. I could not, of course, promise to
join them until I had consulted with you about it, dear Ned, and ask
you whether you would make me a small advance to meet the necessary
expenses of the journey, and to purchase the few things I should
require before starting.

Would you think $300 too much to spare at the present time? I have
a little money left, but not enough to justify my accepting this
invitation without some little help. You have always been so kind and
considerate toward us all, younger children, that I know you will
gladly give me this pleasure if it lies in your power to do so. It
seems a long time since I have seen you, or even heard from you, but
I know how many your engagements are, and that a letter from one so
busy is hardly to be expected, unless there is something especially
interesting to be communicated.

With kindest love, believe me, dear Edward,

                                              Your affectionate sister,
                                                               PAULINE.


=140. From a Niece to an Aunt.=

                                                  A----, July 15, 19--.

Dear Aunt Selma:--

I do earnestly hope you and Uncle Phillip have not thought me
neglectful in not writing to you before this, but beyond asking after
you both and hoping you are quite well, I felt I had nothing to write
about. I lead, as you know, such a quiet life, and the days so resemble
each other, that I can hardly distinguish them apart. I ought perhaps
to be glad of this, as family news when it has to be told is seldom a
matter of rejoicing; quite the contrary, it generally forebodes trouble
and sorrow--at least I have found it so.

The east winds have been very trying to my mother lately, but I am
happy to say she is fairly well and able to go out every day. She sends
her love to you, and hopes to have the pleasure of seeing you and my
dear uncle before long.

How is your work society getting on? I suppose your Sunday-school
picnic will take place next month, as usual. I can imagine how busy
Uncle Phillip must be just now in his garden. Are the bees thriving?
and how do the new glass hives answer? Has he been making any fresh
experiments?

Please give him my best love, and with much to yourself,

                                             Believe me, dear aunt,
                                               Your affectionate niece,
                                                          SOPHIA MOORE.


=141. To a Cousin, Wishing a Merry Christmas.=

                                              F----, December 21, 19--.

Dear Cousin Jane:--

I wish you and dear Aunt Mary a merry Christmas, and many New Years in
the happy future.

It is a long time since we have met; circumstances do not bring
us together--quite the contrary; and were it not for the annually
returning Christmastide, I fear we should almost drop out of each
other's recollection. I am therefore glad of the opportunity of
inquiring after you and Aunt Mary, and trust that you are both
pretty well. I fear she is rather dreading the severe weather which
is prophesied to be in store for us, but prophecies are not always
fulfilled, and, in any case, I hope she will not have a return of her
old complaint, rheumatism.

                                     With kindest love and best wishes,
                                              Your affectionate cousin,
                                                           EUNICE CARY.


=142. From a Ward to His Guardian, Asking for an Increased Allowance.=

                                                 D----, March 10, 19--.

Dear Mr. Wilson:--

With great reluctance I come to ask you to make me a further allowance,
but the fact is, I find it impossible to meet the necessary expenses
that I am compelled to incur, on the sum at present allowed to me. And
as I know how much you disapprove of my getting into debt, I thought it
best to write to you frankly on the subject, and ask to see what you
could do for me. I should be perfectly satisfied with an additional
$500 per annum, and trust you will not think this request unreasonable.

                                                  I beg to remain,
                                                     Very truly yours,
                                                      REGINALD ROBERTS.


143. Answer to the Above.

                                                 C----, March 15, 19--.

Dear Reginald:--

I dislike extremely to refuse a request of yours, but were I to comply
with the last one, just received, I should only encourage you in
extravagance. Your poor father considered the sum at present allowed
you amply sufficient for your wants, and I do not feel justified in
acting contrary to his expressed wishes. However, I have no objection
to making you a present of $100 to meet any pressing claim, but must
again warn you that it is imperative you should restrict expenses
within the limits of your allowance, and this can readily be done
by giving a little more attention to details, and by being less
thoughtless in your every-day expenditure.

                                                   I am, dear Reginald,
                                                   Your sincere friend,
                                                      FREDERICK WILSON.




CHAPTER IV

TO, FROM AND ABOUT GOVERNESSES, CHAPERONS, COMPANIONS, HOUSEKEEPERS,
ETC.


=144. From a Governess Applying for a Position.=

                                                   B----, June 8, 19--.

MADAM:--

Mrs. Alfred D. Campbell informed me, this morning, that you were in
want of a governess for your two little girls, and she recommended me
to apply for the situation at once, thinking that I might perhaps suit
you. My experience in teaching has been gained at home; for the last
two years I have undertaken the sole tuition of my younger sisters.
I may say that I have been well educated, and am quite capable of
instructing young ladies up to the age of fourteen. Mrs. Campbell has
known my family for many years, and authorizes me to say that, should
you wish her to write respecting my qualifications and fitness for the
post of governess in your house, she will be happy to do so.

Hoping to hear favorably in reference to the matter,

                                        I remain,
                                               Yours very respectfully,
                                                       GERTRUDE LELAND.


=145. Asking a Lady Concerning an Applicant for the Position of
Governess.=

                                                  B----, June 28, 19--.

Dear Mrs. Campbell:--

You had the kindness of mentioning to Miss Leland that I was on the
lookout for a governess for my little girls. I understand, from
a letter I just received from this young lady, that she has not
hitherto filled a similar situation, but this I should not consider
a drawback if her qualifications were satisfactory. Would you say
she was thoroughly well educated? Can she teach French and German to
beginners, and has she a good knowledge of music? Is she both amiable
and conscientious? She says you have known her family for some years,
so no doubt will be able to satisfy me on all these points. As regards
the question of salary, I propose giving my governess $500 a year. Will
you kindly mention this to her, and if your answer is such as I expect,
I shall have no hesitation in engaging her at once. I have had a great
many applications for this situation, but I think it such an advantage
to obtain a governess personally recommended by a friend; therefore I
am so much obliged to you for advising Miss Leland to write to me.

With kind remembrances to you and Mr. Campbell, believe me, as ever,

                                      Very truly yours,
                                                 MARCELLA TYLER PORTER.


=146. Recommending a Governess.=

                                                  L----, June 12, 19--.

Dear Mrs. Porter:--

I am happy to be able to speak in the highest terms of Miss Leland,
both as regards her capabilities and moral training; she has been
carefully brought up and well educated; is amiable and high principled.
She speaks German and French fluently, and her knowledge of music
is above the average; she has acquired some experience in teaching,
through having instructed her younger sisters. I may add, from what I
know of Miss Leland you need have no hesitation in engaging her.

                                             Believe me,
                                                Very truly yours,
                                                  DELIA STORY CAMPBELL.


=147. Answering an Advertisement for a Chaperon.=

                                                    W----, May 4, 19--.

  Edward Worthington, Esq.,
    N----.

  SIR:--

Replying to your advertisement for a "Companion and Chaperon to a young
lady," I take the liberty of offering myself for the situation.

My late husband was a captain in the U. S. army; I am 35 years of
age, and have been a widow three years. I am a good linguist, and can
speak French and German fluently; so that should your daughter wish
to continue her studies or travel abroad, my knowledge of languages
might be of use to her. I am considered a clever musician, and have had
a good musical education. The salary mentioned in your advertisement
would be quite satisfactory to me, and I should consider myself most
fortunate were my qualifications to meet with your approval.

With regard to references, Mrs. Black, wife of the Rev. Phillips Black,
pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, this city, and Mrs. Bruce,
1750 M---- Avenue, N----, would be very glad to answer any questions
respecting me. Awaiting your answer,

                                             Believe me,
                                                    Yours respectfully,
                                                       HONORIA DE WITT.


=148. Answering an Advertisement for a Companion.=

                                                  S----, July 19, 19--.

  Miss Selma White,
    City.

  MADAM:--

Answering your advertisement in the "Item" of Saturday the 7th inst,
I beg to offer my services as "Useful Companion to an Elderly Lady."
Should not be afraid to undertake the care of an invalid, and to have
the management of household affairs, as, in both these particulars, I
have had no little experience in my own family. Am 36 years of age, and
the daughter of a physician. Owing to circumstances with which I need
not trouble you at the present moment, am anxious to obtain a situation
of this nature.

I have been accustomed to read aloud and to write letters from
dictation, and to entertain elderly people.

Perhaps it is premature to mention references in this letter, but may
say that I could thoroughly satisfy you on this point by giving you the
names of several ladies of high standing, in this city, who have kindly
promised to recommend me.

Hoping to hear from you favorably,

                                            I am, Madam,
                                                    Yours respectfully,
                                                          EVA B. CLARK.


=149. Replying to an Advertisement for a Housekeeper.=

                                              C----, December 12, 19--.

Sylvester Cary, Esq.

Answering your advertisement in this morning's "Tribune" for a
housekeeper, I beg to offer my services in that capacity.

Am 35 years of age, and my experience has been gained through having
had the entire control of my uncle's house for seven years. The whole
of the domestic arrangements were in my hands--the engaging and
dismissing of servants, giving all orders, and keeping the household
accounts. I also superintended the education of the two younger
children, attended to their wardrobes, and had the entire charge of
them.

Can offer two unexceptionable references, besides a personal one from
the uncle mentioned above, Mr. Frank Robinson, 310 Masonic Temple, city.

Have no doubt that you will receive many applications for the situation
vacant in your establishment; still, I hope that this offer of my
services may meet with your favorable consideration.

                                              Respectfully,
                                                 (MISS) MIRANDA TAYLOR.

=150. From a Housemaid Applying for a Situation.=

                                             H----, September 18, 19--.

MADAM:--

Mrs. Matthews, of H----, informs me that you are in want of a second
maid, and I now apply for the situation. Have been living for the last
two years with Mrs. Richard Stevens, 19 Davis Street, E----, who will
give me an excellent character. I have left her to take care of my sick
mother, who is now quite well again, and does not need me any longer.

Am 23 years of age, and am strong and active. I received $4.50 a week
from Mrs. Matthews. Should be very glad to come over and see you, any
day you may please to name.

                                           I remain,
                                               Very respectfully yours,
                                                         MARY SULLIVAN.


=151. From a Housemaid Accepting a Situation.=

                                             H----, September 21, 19--.

MADAM:--

Your letter received this morning; I beg to say I shall be very pleased
to accept your situation.

Shall be quite ready to come to you on Friday the 24th, and will start
by the 7:30 train from H----.

                                               Very respectfully yours,
                                                         MARY SULLIVAN.


=152. From a Housemaid Excusing Herself for not Taking a Situation.=

                                             H----, September 21, 19--.

MADAM:--

I trust you will pardon me for declining your situation; I fear that
the work would be too heavy for me. Had not sufficiently considered
this before engaging to take the place of house maid in your family,
but feel that I am not strong enough for all that would be required of
me in that capacity.

                                                     Very respectfully,
                                                         MARY SULLIVAN.


=153. Asking for Information Concerning a Maid.=

Will Mrs. White kindly inform Mrs. Grant whether she considers Eliza
Smith--who lived with her as housemaid--to be strictly honest, steady,
obliging, and in all respects a good servant, also the reason of her
leaving Mrs. White's service?

L----, January 19, 19--.


=154. Answer to the Above.=

Mrs. White begs to say that Eliza Smith is honest and steady, but
would require no little training before she could be considered a good
servant. She was only in her service a very short time, and Mrs. White
parted with her, as she was not equal to the work.

L----, January 20, 19--.


=155. Asking for Information Concerning a Cook.=

                                               W----, January 10, 19--.

Mrs. Hardwick would be much obliged if Mrs. Beeton would inform her
whether Mary Brown thoroughly understands the duties of a family cook,
including baking and laundry work; also whether she considers her
trustworthy and reliable. Mrs. Hardwick has been told Mary Brown left
Mrs. Beeton's service by her own desire, and that she is willing to
give her a good character.


=156. Answer to the Above.=

                                               W----, January 12, 19--.

Replying to Mrs. Hardwick's letter, Mrs. Beeton begs to say that she is
able to answer all her questions satisfactorily respecting Mary Brown;
she is a very good plain cook, and well up in her duties, she can bake
good bread, irons nicely, and is most trustworthy in every way. Mrs.
Beeton was sorry to part with her, and she left owing to a disagreement
with the second maid.


=157. Asking for Information Concerning a Butler.=

                                               The High Cliff,
                                                   N----, June 3, 19--.

DEAR MADAM:--

Peter Williams has just applied to me for the situation of butler,
stating that he lived with you in that capacity. Will you kindly tell
me if, while in your service, he was steady, sober, honest, and whether
he thoroughly understands his duties? He informs me he is not a married
man. May I ask if this is the case as far as you know, and might I
further ask the reason of your parting with him?

Thanking you in advance for the trouble,

                                            I remain,
                                                 Your obedient servant,
                                                     GEORGE SAINTSBURY.


=158. Answer to the Above.=

                                                       Hawthorne Lodge.

Mrs. Stafford regrets to say that she must decline to give Peter
Williams a recommendation. She may further add that he was in her
service five weeks only.

June 4, 19--.


=159. From a Cook Asking a Lady to Recommend Her.=

                                               D----, December 5, 19--.

  Mrs. Raymond.
    MADAM:--

Will you kindly excuse my troubling you, but may I ask if you would
have any objection to saying what you could in my favor to Mrs.
Wyndham, who will engage me as cook, if I can obtain a satisfactory
reference as to my capacity and character. Thought, as I had formerly
lived in your service, I might be allowed to refer to you. Am aware
that I cannot ask for a character, having received one on leaving your
service; but, unfortunately, when I left my last situation the lady
refused to give me one on account of my having lost my temper with her,
she having been previously very violent in her language towards me.

I mentioned this circumstance to Mrs. Wyndham, who says she will
overlook it if the answer from my former mistress to her inquiries was
satisfactory.

Shall be very grateful, madam, if you will grant this request.

                                             I beg to remain,
                                                    Yours respectfully,
                                                          MARY O'BRIEN.


=160. From a Nurse to Her Mistress Absent from Home.=

                                                P----, August 10, 19--.

MADAM:--

I am glad to be able to inform you that the dear children are quite
well. Miss Nina has almost lost her cough, and Master Robert has a
wonderful appetite compared to what he had when you left home. They
all send their best love to dear papa and mamma. I am very particular
in attending to all your directions. The house is kept as cool as the
season permits, and the heat is quite bearable. I never allow the
children to be out in the sun, and I give them cold baths morning and
evening.

Enclosed please find the list of things wanted for the young ladies
which you desire me to send.

                                         I beg to remain
                                               Very respectfully yours,
                                                             KATE DALY.


=161. Marriage Proposal from a Butler to a Cook.=

                                                 N----, March 12, 19--.

Dear Miss O'Neil:--

For some time past, I have been anxious to make my feelings known to
you, but have not had an opportunity of doing so. I therefore think it
best not to delay any longer, but to tell you by letter that I very
much wish to make you my wife, if you think you could be happy with me.
We have seen each other so often the last two years, I am quite sure
I should never like any one but you; and want you to express the same
favorable opinion about me, and say that your heart is mine, my dear
Mary. If this is so, the sooner we are married the better.

The legacy of $600 received from my late master, added to my own
savings of the last ten years, will enable me to take a boarding-house
in a good location, and have already seen one which no doubt would
answer very well; but I cannot decide upon anything until you accept me
as your husband, and if I have not greatly mistaken your sentiments I
believe you will.

                                         Believe me ever, my dear Mary,
                                                       Your fond lover,
                                                          THOMAS BLACK.


=162. Answer to the Above.=

                                                  H----, March 1, 19--.

My Dear Mr. Black:--

I answer your kind and welcome letter at once. You have not mistaken my
feelings: I have a great respect and esteem for you joined to a sincere
affection, and from what I know of you, I feel sure you would make me
a good and kind husband, and therefore have no hesitation in accepting
your offer. Am very much flattered by your good opinion of me, and, as
your wife, I will do everything in my power to continue to deserve it.

I hardly know what to say about being married at once, as I am very
comfortable in my present situation, and putting by a little money
every year; but, as you think of taking a boarding-house at once, I had
better hear what you have to say before making up my mind either way.

Hoping to see you very soon,

                                        I am, dear Tom, with kind love,
                                                Your truly affectionate
                                                            MARY BAKER.

LOVE AND MARRIAGE

CHAPTER I

PROPOSALS, ACCEPTANCES, REFUSALS

=163. From a Gentleman to a Young Lady Friend of His about a
Misunderstanding.=

                                              D----, September 5, 19--.

My Dear Miss Reiley:--

Will you, please, pardon my addressing this note to you? I write not
from a dislike of a personal interview, but because it is better to
avoid any unnecessary embarrassment for either of us. I scarcely think
it is due to over-sensitiveness on my part that you have seemed of
late to repel me. Had I not previously been made gratefully happy by
your frank cordiality toward me, I should unquestionably accept your
present manner as indicative of your wishes in regard to me. But as it
is, I don't understand you, and I am sure you don't understand me. If
I have offended you in any way, it has been unknowingly, and it would
be a privilege to be allowed to explain myself, or apologize if needed.
With this in view, will you give me the pleasure of your company for a
drive Saturday afternoon at four o'clock? If it is a matter of perfect
indifference, I beg of you to make no excuses in consideration of my
feelings in declining this invitation.

                                                   Your sincere friend,
                                                          JAMES DUNCAN.


=164. Answer to the Above (Kindly).=

                                              D----, September 7, 19--.

My Dear Mr. Duncan:--

I have not meant to be mysterious. If any inconsistency in my manner
toward you has disturbed your mind, it is for me to ask your pardon.
It has been quite unintentional. I will be much pleased to drive with
you, as suggested, Saturday afternoon, when any further explanations
that may be necessary can be exchanged.

                                                Faithfully yours,
                                                     MARGUERITE REILEY.


=165. Answer to No. 163 (Conciliatory).=

                                              D----, September 7, 19--.

My Dear Mr. Duncan:--

It will give me pleasure to drive with you, as suggested, Saturday
afternoon. You must not think it is a matter of indifference to me if I
have treated you with injustice, and I want to do my part in coming to
a satisfactory understanding. Perhaps an exchange of explanations will
set everything right.

                                              Yours sincerely,
                                                     MARGUERITE REILEY.


=166. Answer to No. 163 (Chilly).=

                                              D----, September 7, 19--.

My Dear Mr. Duncan:--

I think that my manner toward my friends and acquaintances usually
represents me correctly. Truth to one's self will not always allow
absolute uniformity in one's outward action. This, I trust, will
sufficiently account for any change you may have noticed in my attitude
toward you. I think a further exchange of explanations will not be
profitable.

                                                Yours truly,
                                                     MARGUERITE REILEY.


=167. From a Gentleman to a Young Lady Asking the Privilege of a
Correspondence.=

                                                   M----, July 7, 19--.

My Dear Miss Lyman:--

To-day, I send you by express a few little articles belonging to you
which my sister Eva, after your somewhat hurried departure, found in
her room and in the library. I hope they will reach you safely before
you notice that they have been forgotten.

I thank you for inadvertently furnishing me, by your oversight, a
plausible excuse for writing. I should esteem it a very great privilege
if you would grant me permission to write again without an excuse for
doing so, and I should be gratefully happy if I might receive a reply
from you once in a while.

The house seems quite deserted since you left. We all miss you--and
"all" contains a very emphatic capital "I." Shall send the pictures as
soon as I have finished developing them. I believe Eva is writing you
all the news.

                                                       Yours sincerely,
                                                        PHILLIP HARRIS.


=168. Answer to the Above.=

                                                  S----, July 10, 19--.

My Dear Mr. Harris:--

Very many thanks for sending me the articles; they arrived safely
this morning. Do you think it quite right to encourage my habits of
carelessness by thanking me for my thoughtlessness?

I have just written a long letter to Eva, telling her all that has
happened at home during my absence, and I will not repeat myself to you.

I shall wait patiently, but very expectantly for the pictures. When
they come I will write you my comments upon them.

I should be much pleased to hear from you again as you suggest.
Thanking you for all you did to make my visit in M---- a pleasant one,
I remain,

                                                   Your sincere friend,
                                                         ELEANOR LYMAN.


=169. From a Gentleman Asking Permission of a Lady to Address Her by
Her Christian Name.=

                                              M----, September 8, 19--.

My Dear Eleanor:--

You see I venture to call you by your given name. If in thus expressing
myself toward you I take undue liberty, I beg you to reprove me, and I
shall humbly return to the more formal address. I think of you so often
that I seem to have known you a very long time.

Am working hard every day and until late in the evening, and I have not
yet had time to read the book you speak of. I have drawn it, however,
from the library, and I promise myself the pleasure of reading it
Sunday afternoon.

I feel almost ready to apologize for the length of my last letter.
It seemed as if I couldn't make you understand my friend Gunther's
difficulties, without the dull details of the peculiar circumstances. I
thank you for the consideration you gave the matter. He is trying your
plan.

Am very glad your mother is better.

                                                   Your friend as ever,
                                                        PHILLIP HARRIS.


=170. Answer to the Above.=

                                             S----, September 15, 19--.

My Dear Mr. Harris:--

I like to be Eleanor to the good friends who help to make this world
for me such a delightful place to live in, and you are one of them.
Thank you for the old Indian chief's picture. What a fine face he has!

I am to take the children to a picnic at the river side this afternoon,
and it is time to begin putting up their luncheon. So this must be one
of my short letters.

                                                   Your sincere friend,
                                                               ELEANOR.


=171. From a Gentleman Asking a Lady for an Interview.=

                                                 R----, April 14, 19--.

My Dear Miss Brown:--

Permit me to ask the favor of an interview, at as early a date as will
be convenient to you, if you will be kind enough to grant me one.
I have some things to say of very great importance to myself, and
trust they will not be without interest to you. I should not care to

Your kind note of the 14th is at hand. I shall be pleased to accede

My Dear Eleanor:--

I was disappointed yesterday, but this evening your letter came--and
what a welcome it received! I cannot tell you how much a part of my
life your letters have become, how they have helped to lift me to a
purer, clearer atmosphere, how they have made the common things of
everyday seem noble and worth while. Should our friendship end here, I
could not but be deeply grateful for what you have done for me--done
unconsciously by simply being what you are--and all my life I should
be a better man for having met you. At the very beginning of our
acquaintance you won my heart by your gentle ways and your bright,
sweet unselfishness and ready sympathy, and time has only deepened the
feeling that was awakened in me by my first meeting with you. It has
been hard, harder than you can ever know, my darling, to love as I
have loved you and be silent so long. You are the most beautiful, the
dearest girl in all the world, and I love you, love you with all my
heart and strength and soul, and long to prove it by a life's devotion.
Dearest, all that I have or am or ever hope to be is yours, yours now
and forever, yours wholly and absolutely. Would I had more to offer
you! It is little--only myself. Dear Eleanor, can it not be? May I not
devote my life to making you happy and myself more worthy of you? If
you are not sure of yourself, only give me a chance and I will make you
love me. Let me plead my cause in person. I long to see your own sweet
lips and eyes say yes to me.

                                                 Yours ever,
                                                        PHILLIP HARRIS.

Dear Phillip:--

Your letter came last evening. It hardly took me by surprise, but made
me very happy. I cannot help being glad that you love me, Phillip, and
have begun to do some hard thinking to find out what my feeling is
toward you. You know it is a long time since we have seen each other. I
want so much to see you again, and if you come, as you suggest, shall
try not to disappoint you.

                                                       Yours sincerely,

Dear Phillip:--

Your last letter was a complete surprise to me. I cannot but feel
honored by the kind regard of one for whom I harbor no sentiment but
respect and admiration, but am quite sure that our friendship, so
pleasantly begun, can never ripen into any deeper relation.

I am very sorry to seem unappreciative. While thanking you for the
honor you have paid me, I am so clear that my view of the matter is
right, that I believe a fuller consideration on your part will convince
you also of the same. I must ask your pardon for not having observed
earlier the course of your thought toward me, but did not know that you
regarded our friendship in so serious a light. Forgive me and believe
me,

                                                   Your sincere friend,

Dear Madam:--

I know only too well that I am taking a very unusual step in venturing
to address you, but let me trust that under the circumstances you
will be inclined to excuse it, as unfortunately there appears to be
no other course open to me of making myself known. Your beauty has
inspired me with a most sincere admiration, and the various occasions
on which I have had the pleasure of seeing you have served but to
deepen the impression at first created; thus the one hope that animates
me in writing, is that you may be induced to return my affection and
ultimately become my wife. My position and means would, probably, be
found satisfactory to your friends, and I trust you will give me an
early opportunity of pleading my suit in person, and of offering every
possible explanation to your relatives respecting my prospects in
life. In the meantime, I should tell you that I have lately become a
junior partner in the well-known firm of Messrs. Andrews Bros. civil
engineers and contractors, of this city, and am thoroughly able to
maintain a wife in comfort, if not in luxury. Kindly accept my enclosed
photograph. Dare I hope that it may silently speak for me?

Believe me, dear madam, with humblest apology for my boldness,

                                               Yours most respectfully,
                                                     SYLVESTER LANGDON.

Dear Sir:--

Your letter received this morning surprised me greatly, coming from
an entire stranger. I at once showed it to my aunt, with whom I am
staying, and she considers it so straightforward, that she sees no
objection to your calling on her, especially as she is slightly
acquainted with some members of your family. My aunt will be at home
about four o'clock, but you must not consider this permission to
call as an encouragement of your hopes on my part. It is merely an
opportunity afforded by my relative of our becoming acquainted.

                                                 Believe me,
                                                      Very truly yours,
                                                          ETHEL DUNLAP.

Miss Ethel Dunlap was naturally very much surprised at the contents of
Mr. Langdon's letter. She hastens to inform him that it is out of the
question she should entertain his proposals. She need not trouble him
with her reasons for this decision, beyond saying that they are quite
conclusive, and she very much regrets, for Mr. Langdon's sake, that he
should have allowed himself to think of her for a moment. She begs to
return his photo, and to add that she trusts the impression she appears
to have made upon him will prove but a very transitory one.

My Dear Miss Starr:--

I have met you very frequently at your father's house and elsewhere,
and your manner has ever been most kind and friendly towards me. Yet I
dare not flatter myself that you are aware of the deep love I entertain
for you, a love which now emboldens me to write and to confess how the
hope of gaining your affection and of inducing you to become my wife,
has been for the last few months uppermost in my mind. Should I be
so fortunate as to win your regard, your happiness should be my one
thought and care, and you should never regret having entrusted it to my
keeping.

I shall await your answer with the greatest impatience. If there is any
hope, hasten to put an end to my anxieties, and make me the happiest of
men.

If, on the other hand, you require time for consideration, do not be
afraid to ask for it. Now that you know how dearly I love you I can
afford to leave my cause in your hands, and to wait any length of time
you may consider necessary for your final decision.

                                           Believe me, dear Miss Starr,
                                                 Yours very faithfully,

Dear Mr. Peabody:--

Hitherto I have looked upon you only as a friend, and I can hardly yet
realize that you wish me to regard you in any other light. From what I
already know, I have no doubt that you would make any girl very happy
whom you loved, but, although I have a great liking and esteem for you,
I cannot say that I return your affection as you deserve.

However, as I know how good and kind you are, and how highly both my
father and mother think of you, let us hope that in time I may learn
to love as much as I esteem. It is perhaps better not to say more at
present. Please believe in my deep-felt gratitude for the offer of your
life's devotion.

                                                  Very sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Peabody:--

Your letter has occasioned me much pain, because I have but one answer
to make to it. I wish for your sake it were otherwise, but you must
only think of me as a friend.

Great as is the honor you have done me in asking me to become your
wife, I must hold out no hope of such a possibility. Kindly accept
this answer as final, and do not press me for a reason. I shall always
value your friendship very highly, and trust that after a little time
we may meet again as friends, and that you will forgive me for the
disappointment of to-day, which I cause so unwillingly.

With best wishes for your happiness,

                                                   Believe me,

My Dear Miss Jones:--

I earnestly hope not to be mistaken in thinking you are aware of the
sentiments I entertain for you; I have made this very plain in the
attentions I had the happiness of paying you; but lest any doubt should
exist in your mind as to the strength of my attachment, let me tell
you how very dear you are to me, and how each time I have seen you the
feeling has deepened into more devoted love.

I feel sure that I am not indifferent to you, and that were it
otherwise, you are too kindhearted to have misled me into believing
this, and therefore do not hesitate to ask for your love. May I write
to your father on this subject at once? You see, your consent is taken
for granted. Still, my dearest, I shall look with some anxiety for the
assurance that I have not misunderstood your feelings, and that you
return my affection, so that before long I may have the happiness of
claiming you as my wife. How cruel that our being away from each other
obliges me to write what it would have been such a delight to speak out
in unmistakable words.

                                                 Believe me ever yours,
                                                      Devotedly,

Dear Mr. Liscombe:--

Your letter has made me very happy. For some time, I have believed
that you cared for me; how could I think otherwise, from the way in
which you constantly devoted yourself to me? Still, I was very glad to
receive the confession of your sincere attachment, and will not attempt
to conceal how truly I return it, and how earnestly I shall endeavor
to prove worthy of your devotion. I feel sure, that there is perfect
sympathy between us, and that my happiness will be as safe in your
hands as yours will be in mine.

My father has been told of your proposal, and wishes me to say, that he
will be pleased to hear from you.

                                             Believe me yours,

Dear Miss Southgate:--

For several days I have been pondering in my mind whether it would
be best to write or speak to you on the subject that is nearest to
my heart, or whether it would be wiser for your sake to keep silence
altogether; however, I have now decided to plead my cause as best I can.

Do you think you could be happy as the wife of a poor man? would you
be content to wait until such time as my income would justify me in
marrying? would the knowledge that my heart is all your own induce you
to feel a corresponding affection for me? or am I asking too much?
Would you be afraid to enter into a long engagement, an engagement
of perhaps two years? Although I am not in a position to maintain a
wife at the present time, my prospects are encouraging, as my uncle
has promised to take me into partnership early next year, which will
materially improve my position. In the meantime, the knowledge that I
am working for you will brighten every hour of my life, while for your
goodness in thus waiting and trusting, no after-devotion on my part can
ever repay.

I hope your answer will not be long delayed, as my anxiety will be
great, indeed.

Believe me, dear Miss Southgate,

                                                 Yours very faithfully,
                                                       ARTHUR REDFIELD.

Dear Mr. Redfield:--

It would not be truthful for me to say that I am surprised at the
contents of your letter; on the contrary, I almost knew beforehand
what you were anxious to say to me and what I was anxious to hear.
You cannot suppose I should be afraid to be a poor man's wife; my
love would be little worth having if it were so: no, I do not dread a
long engagement, it will give us time to know each other better; my
attachment to you is sufficiently strong to bear the strain. I am not
afraid that your feelings will undergo a change towards me, or that
mine will alter towards you. Indeed, should either of us cease to love
the other it would only prove how wise we were to put our affection to
the test by waiting.

My mother, I am sorry to say, entertains a prejudice against long
engagements; she has no real objection to this particular one, however,
as she has a personal liking for you, so I think she will not oppose
the realization of our wishes, as she will know that my happiness is so
deeply concerned, and together I hope we shall make her believe that
she approves of our attachment and of our engagement.

I shall hope to see you to-morrow; dear Mr. Redfield,

                                                Believe me,
                                                   Yours lovingly,

Dear Mr. Redfield:--

Believe me, I am deeply grieved at the answer I am obliged to give
you; but I have no alternative than to write as I am now doing. My
father will not for a moment hear of our engagement, and whatever my
own feelings may be, you would not, I am sure, wish me to disobey him.
He considers a long engagement would be most imprudent on our part; he
says you may not be in the same mind two years hence, and that your
prospects are too uncertain to render such a step advisable.

All this sounds cold and hard; but, coming from him, it must be said. I
dare not hold out a hope that, if we are both free "two years hence,"
you might expect a very different answer, because this might appear
in the light of a secret understanding; still, I do not think that I
shall easily forget you, or stop thinking of you, or cease to take a
warm interest in all that concerns you. Dear Mr. Redfield, good-bye,
forgive me for the disappointment I am compelled to inflict, think of
me kindly, and believe me,

                                                  Yours very sincerely,

Dear Miss Sutter:--

Lately I have had the happiness of meeting you very frequently at the
houses of mutual friends, and each occasion has served to strengthen
the impression made upon me on first seeing you. I should consider
myself the most fortunate of men if I could persuade you to accept me
as your future husband. Though well aware of the disparity of age that
exists between us, I trust that you will not regard it as a bar to my
happiness. I am still, if I say so myself, in the prime of life, and
the experience my years give me will better enable me to shield your
youth, and be protector and considerate counselor, as well as the most
devoted of husbands, if you will give me the right to be so.

Although not a rich man by any means, still I can offer you every
possible comfort that easy circumstances permit. As to my position
and surroundings, they are well known to you. I trust I have not been
premature in disclosing my hopes, and that they may receive favorable
consideration at your hands.

Pray believe me, dear Miss Sutter,

                                                 Very faithfully yours,

Dear Mr. Lewis:--

I deeply appreciate the honor you have done me in asking for my hand.
Although I have always entertained a great esteem and regard for you, I
had not, hitherto, thought of you as a lover; but perhaps, in time, may
feel the affection which is due from a woman to the one who is to be
her husband; only you must be content to wait a little, and not expect
too much at first. Allow me to add that my heart is quite disengaged,
and that you have no rival to contend with, merely the ideal hero who
finds a place in the imagination of most girls. My sister thinks that I
am very fortunate to have won your affections, and she hopes that you
will soon give her an opportunity of telling you so. I shall remain
here for the next three weeks, when mamma is coming up for a few days
to take me back home. I have written to her of your letter, and shall
doubtless receive an answer soon.

With my sister's kind regards and mine, believe me, dear Mr. Lewis,

                                                  Very sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Lewis:--

While sincerely grateful for the high compliment you pay me in asking
me to be your wife, I cannot, to my regret, entertain your proposal. I
like you very much indeed as a friend, but am quite sure I should not
be happy with one so much older than myself. You would probably think
me foolish if not frivolous, and I should very likely fear you more
than love you. In a word, I should not be a suitable wife. Please do
not think of me in that light, as it would not be for the happiness of
either of us.

My sister thinks otherwise, and wished me to return a very different
answer; but you are too good and kind for any one to marry you save
from motives of affection.

With all good wishes, believe me,

                                                  Very sincerely yours,

My Dear Mrs. Lothrop:--

I have been pondering many things--reviewing the past, looking forward
to the future, and trying to see the meaning, the purpose, running
through the tangled web of life. We don't either of us believe that
chance directs our course in this world. It was not, then, chance
that brought us together at the anniversaries three years ago. Since
that time we have had many opportunities of becoming acquainted; our
children have grown to be fast friends; my boy's heart was won to you
from the first word you ever spoke to him. Chance has not worked all
this; nor is it chance, dear Mrs. Lothrop, that opened my eyes to find
in you my ideal of perfect womanhood.

The brief happiness that has been mine is a memory sacredly cherished
for its own sake, but the disappointments, the struggles, the sorrows
of my life have served only to prepare me to appreciate the nobility,
the sweetness and the truth of your nature, and my own need of you.
Dear Mrs. Lothrop, I love you with the deep, unchanging love of matured
manhood. I long to cherish you, to protect you and your little son from
the rude blows of the world.

We cannot either of us forget the past. Those whom we have loved and
who have loved us will not rejoice to see us sad and lonely for their
sake. Surely we should not wish them, in that brighter world where they
have gone, to be sad for us, and shut out other love and friendship.

Your boy will soon need a father, mine wants a mother now; we need each
other, and I love you with all the strength of my being. Can you not
learn to reciprocate my feelings, and if so may we not hope for God's
blessing in joining our earthly fates?

                                                     Yours ever,
                                                         HENRY WALDRON.

My Dear Mr. Waldron:--

It is true, as you say, that our ways have been strangely brought
together. I have even sometimes wondered what the end of it all might
be, although I have not dared to cherish any definite thought on
the subject. Through our acquaintance, I have learned gradually and
unconsciously to trust you and depend upon your judgment in many little
matters, and find pleasure and comfort in your society. Your letter
has touched a responsive chord, and my heart urges me to yield to your
desire. And yet, I know not. Let us see each other, let us talk the
matter over together.

                                                 Yours sincerely,
                                                      MARGARET LOTHROP.

My Dear Mrs. Taylor:--

If I were to state that I have long admired you, that would be simply
telling what you already know; but hitherto I have felt a reluctance
to express my warm feelings of regard towards you, lest I should be
accused of mercenary motives, owing to the difference that exists in
our fortunes, you having wealth at your command, while I am in very
moderate circumstances. Your manner of late has been so kind--dare I
say, encouraging?--that it seems to me that I should be wronging your
generous nature, if any false pride on my part were allowed to stand
between me and my hopes. Dear Mrs. Taylor, will you accept the devotion
of my life, and let it be my one aim to make you happy? If sincere
affection can do this, it is yours to command.

I shall see you this evening, but let me have one line if possible
before then. In the meantime,

                                                 I remain,
                                                   Devotedly yours,
                                                      ALBERT S. ORMSBY.

Dear Mr. Ormsby:--

You are certainly not fair to yourself and to me when you write that
I could for a moment believe you capable of unworthy motives or that
you would feign a love not sincerely felt. I have too high an opinion
of you and of your principles to be otherwise than flattered by your
preference. After this frank confession of regard for me, I will not
hesitate to say that I feel well inclined towards you, so well indeed,
that I may bid you hope; you must not be too impatient, but give me
time to be certain that in marrying you I should be consulting my
own happiness as well as yours. Nothing more can be said at present.
Believe me,

                                            Yours very sincerely,
                                                  FRANCES STONE TAYLOR.

Dear Mr. Ormsby:--

I have certainly no reason to suspect that your professions of
affection for myself are dictated from mercenary motives, and while
declining your proposal I render full justice to your high principles;
but I have no other feeling for you than that of mere friendship,
and if anything in my manner has led you to think otherwise, I can
only express my sincere regrets, and assure you that it was quite
unintentional on my part.

                                             I remain, dear Mr. Ormsby,
                                                Truly yours,
                                                  FRANCES STONE TAYLOR.

                                             I----, September 12, 19--.

My Dear Miss Cummings:--

Will you allow me to ask you a very serious question which nearly
concerns my happiness, trusting you will be able to grant me a
favorable answer? From what I have seen of your amiable disposition
and gentleness, I feel sure that you would make me a sweet and loving
wife and companion. Will you consent to this, and be the mother of my
darling children? They are so young that at present they have hardly
realized their loss. They have already learned to love you, and it is
in your power to fill up the void that now exists both in my heart and
home.

It is now two years since I suffered a loss which was then thought
irreparable, but since we became acquainted, I have felt that there
was yet happiness in store for me, if you would accept my love, none
the less sincere because I have loved before, and mourned so deeply.
Do not hesitate to tell me frankly whether the interest I have
awakened in your heart is a feeling of regard for myself or merely
one of compassion for my lonely condition. One word as regards my
circumstances. Have a fairly good income, but this is a matter for your
father's consideration, and I can satisfy him on this point. Shall I
call and receive your answer to-morrow from yourself, or will you write
to me? Perhaps the latter would be best.

Believe me, dear Miss Cummings,

                                                 Yours very faithfully,
                                                        ADRIAN SOMMERS.

                                             S----, September 13, 19--.

Dear Mr. Sommers:--

Yes, it is true that I feel deeply interested in you and in your sweet
children. I have felt so sorry for you and for them. Do you really
think I could be to you all you say and replace the one you have
lost? I should not be afraid to undertake the responsibility of being
a mother to your little pets, if certain that it would be for your
happiness; mine I am sure would be secured by such a marriage, and I do
not hesitate to say that I will be to you everything you wish. So far,
I have not spoken to my father about the matter, and would rather leave
it to you to do so; he regards you so highly that you may feel sure of
a welcome.

                                          Believe me, dear Mr. Sommers,
                                                  Yours very sincerely,

                                             S----, September 13, 19--.

Dear Mr. Sommers:--

It is a matter of much regret to me that the friendly interest I have
taken in you and your dear little children should have led you to
imagine that I entertained towards you a warmer feeling than that of
friendship; perhaps it would be kinder to tell you at once that my
affections are already engaged, although there is no immediate prospect
of my marriage, and the engagement is at present only known to the
members of my family. My heart being devoted to another, I felt at
liberty to manifest an almost sisterly liking for you, in my endeavor
to cheer you and lighten your sorrow. I am deeply grieved to have
unintentionally misled you into thinking I cared for you in the way you
wish.

Now that you know the reason why I cannot return your affection, you
will not think I am to blame, and allow me to regard you as one of my
greatest friends.

Pray believe me, dear Mr. Sommers, with kindest wishes for your
happiness,

                                                      Yours very truly,

Dear Miss Denslow:--

I truly believe you must have realized, for some time, how much
pleasure I take in your society, how greatly I have been attracted by
your many charms, and how deeply I admire all your amiable qualities.
I am only one of the many who have already told you this, but still
venture to hope that I am not altogether indifferent to you. Your
friends will perhaps tell you that I am old enough to be your father,
and that a man with grown-up daughters ought not to think of making
so young a girl his wife, but in spite of my being well over forty,
my sympathies and affections are as keen as if I were twenty years
younger, and if you will accept me, it shall be the study of my life to
make you happy. You would be a sister and companion to my girls, and
to myself the most beloved of wives. Will not press you to give me an
answer at once; take time to consider if you think it would be for your
happiness to link your fate with mine. How grateful I should be if you
decide in my favor! Believe me in the meantime,

                                                 Very faithfully yours,

Dear Mr. Lowell:--

I have thought for some time over the contents of your kind letter,
that I might be quite sure I was taking a wise decision. It is not the
difference of age between us that has made me a little doubtful as to
what would be my welcome in your family; but whether my coming amongst
you in this position would not make things unpleasant for you as well
as for myself. Your daughters are great friends of mine, it is true,
but would they not feel aggrieved at my being the mistress of a house
over which they have themselves had sole control? However, I am perhaps
too sensitive in this matter, and it should be wrong to sacrifice your
happiness and my own to an idea which perhaps is unfounded. Enough has
been said for you to understand the feelings with which I regard you,
and if, after reading this letter, you still think I could make you
happy, I will offer no further objections to your wishes.

Believe me, dear Mr. Lowell,

                                                      Very truly yours,

Dear Mr. Lowell:--

Much as I like and esteem you, I nevertheless shrink from the
responsibility of the position you offer me. Such a step would be
neither for your happiness nor for mine. Your daughters would very
naturally regard me as an intruder, and would feel very pained at your
marrying a girl as young as themselves. I am quite serious in what I
say, and am not at all likely to think differently; let us therefore
hope that you will soon view my decision in the same light, that is to
say, as the only fitting one under the circumstances.

                                                  With all good wishes,
                                                      Yours very truly,

Dear Miss Simpson:--

Ever since I have had the happiness of visiting you, on a friendly
basis, the one wish of my heart has been to become worthy of you,
and to succeed in winning your affections. I know that you have many
admirers, but none, believe me, more devoted than myself. Of course,
I have the disadvantage in the eyes of your friends of being poor and
they may endeavor to make you believe that it is the heiress I love;
but do not think so badly of me, dear Miss Simpson, as to entertain so
cruel a suspicion of one who, if you were penniless, would be proud to
prove his devotion to you. It is idle to distress you and myself with
such doubts; let me rather assure you of my unchanging love, and of
my confidence that, with youth and hope in my favor, I have a bright
career opening before me. For the fulfillment of my wishes, I should
be content to wait any time that you and your friends might consider
expedient, provided you gave me the assurance that you returned
my affection, and would lighten my probation by your sympathy and
encouragement.

I have but inadequately expressed what was uppermost in my heart, but
you will, I am sure, give me credit for all that was left unsaid.

                                                  With sincere regards,
                                                    Believe me,
                                                      Yours very truly,

Dear Mr. Cane:--

Your letter, so tender and straightforward, made me both happy and
unhappy; happy in knowing that you love me, and unhappy at the
opposition which I fear awaits us both at the hands of my uncle and
guardian. It will be very difficult to make him believe in your
disinterested affection, and even more so to gain his consent to our
engagement; from the few words he said to me on the subject, I know he
holds very strong opinions against my marrying any one who has not some
means of his own. I need not tell you that his views are not mine in
the least; I am only too glad to be rich for your sake, but we must
both be brave, and trust in the future. You must not take umbrage at
anything my uncle may say to you, and I will endeavor to make amends
for any harshness on his part you may have to endure, by showing you
how much I value your love.

With kindest wishes, but with rather a sinking heart,

                                               Believe me,
                                                  Yours affectionately,

Dear Mr. Cane:--

While I am much flattered by the favorable impression I seem to have
made upon you, I have never thought of you as a possible husband,
although as an agreeable partner at a ball I like you very much.
To speak frankly, I am certain never to care for you save as an
acquaintance. I am afraid, in spite of your disclaimer to the contrary,
that were it not for the accident of my prospective wealth you would
not have thought of proposing to me; but be this as it may, it would
not influence the answer I have to give you, and it is kindest and
best to tell at once, that there is no hope of my changing my feelings
toward you.

Thanking you for the honor thus done me,

                                                   I remain,

CHAPTER II

TO AND FROM PARENTS, GUARDIANS, FRIENDS, ETC., IN REFERENCE TO MARRIAGE
MATTERS


=204. Asking a Father for His Daughter's Hand.=

                                              N----, February 19, 19--.

  Edward T. Jones, Esq.
    DEAR SIR:--

I wish to write to you upon a matter in which the happiness of my
life is concerned. I have long admired your second daughter, Miss
Helen Jones, and trust I am not mistaken in thinking that she is not
indifferent to me; indeed, I am confident that, with your permission
to do so, I could succeed in winning her affections; but I hesitate to
say a word to her on this subject until assured of your sanction to
address her. I have even delayed asking for your consent to be accepted
as a suitor for your daughter's hand, fearing that you might consider
my prospects hardly justify me in taking such a step; but I can wait no
longer to declare my sentiments, and to learn what chance there may be
for me.

My salary and income together do not amount to more than $1,800 a year,
but with what you may be inclined to give your daughter, should her
marriage meet with your approval, I have no doubt that with prudence
and economy I might be able to make a comfortable home for her.

Hoping you will give this letter your favorable consideration,

                                               Believe me
                                                    Respectfully yours,
                                                           HENRY LLOYD.

My Dear Mr. Lloyd:--

I must say that I do not altogether approve of early marriages, or
think it right that a young man should rely upon other than his
own resources when he contemplates maintaining a wife. However, as
my daughter's happiness is my first consideration, and as I find on
questioning her that she is evidently attached to you, I shall not
oppose your engagement, and will do what I can to enable you to marry;
but, in justice to my other children, cannot promise to do much, and
$1500 a year is the utmost allowance I can make her. Shall further
expect you both to wait at least six months, which at your time of life
ought to be and indeed is no hardship; anyway, this is the decision I
have arrived at after mature deliberation.

                                                 I remain,
                                                    Yours respectfully,

  Henry Lloyd, Esq.
    DEAR SIR:--

The only part of your letter which afforded me any satisfaction is
that wherein you say you have not spoken to my daughter regarding your
hopes. I may as well inform you that I am not prepared to make her any
allowance on her marriage. What she will receive from me at my death is
a question for my future consideration. I do not intend her to marry a
man who cannot support her without coming to her father for help, and
you will distinctly understand that I beg to decline your proposal for
her hand.

                                                      Yours obediently,
                                                       EDWARD T. JONES.

                                                   R----, May 24, 19--.

  Arthur Brown, Esq.
    DEAR SIR:--

My frequent calls at your hospitable home during the last three months
have doubtless prepared you, to some extent at least, for the request
I am about to make. It was my good fortune to meet your daughter Ada,
last Christmas eve, at the house of a mutual friend. Since that time,
many opportunities of renewing an acquaintance so pleasantly begun have
presented themselves, of which I have been delighted to avail myself.

The result of these happy interviews is that admiration and esteem
have ripened into love, and I now ask your kind consent to be a
suitor for your daughter's hand. I have not taken this step without
some reasonable ground for hoping that such a suit would at least be
seriously entertained. But I have been trained to regard the rights of
parents with such respect, that it would add largely to my delight in
this important step of life if I might count on your hearty consent.
You have known my family for years, and on that ground, am proud to
feel assured that there will be no difficulty whatever. My business
position and prospects are such as to assure all the joys and comforts
of a happy home, should your daughter do me the honor to share my
lot. This matter I should be glad to explain more in detail if you so
desire, and to submit a complete statement of my net assets and future
resources.

With sincere thanks to Mrs. Brown and yourself, and to all the members
of your household, for the many kindnesses received,

                                          I am, dear sir,
                                               Yours very respectfully,
                                                       ALFRED D. JONES.

My Dear Mr. Jones:--

Your letter has not greatly surprised me. With the spirit of it I am
much pleased. Such an important step in life as you contemplate should
always be taken thoughtfully, and the hearty consent of the interested
families is, in my judgment, greatly to be desired. So far as my
daughter Ada is concerned, my one great desire for her is that her life
may be as peaceful and happy in the future as it has been in the past.
You have my consent to woo, and if wooing you should win, you will win
a treasure. I pray God will guide all for the best.

His Daughter.=

  Henry Longstreet, Esq.
    DEAR SIR:--

I have been fortunate enough to gain your daughter's affections, and,
having spoken to her on the subject of my hopes yesterday, I hasten to
ask for your consent to our engagement, trusting earnestly that you
will not withhold it. My constant endeavor will be to make her happy,
and to prove myself worthy of her choice. Before saying a word to her,
I talked the matter over with my father, and he has promised to do all
he can to further my wishes, and says he will allow me $1,000 a year
from October next, in addition to the salary I now receive, and which
amounts to $3,000. Your daughter fully understands my position, and
is quite willing to accept the home I can offer her, subject to your
approval.

                                                 Believe me,
                                                    Respectfully yours,
                                                          EDWARD KEANE.


=210. Answer to the Above (Favorable).=

                                                   E----, June 5, 19--.

My Dear Mr. Keane:--

If I feel absolutely certain that my daughter's happiness is concerned
in obtaining my consent to her engagement with you, I will offer no
opposition to it, and shall be glad to receive you at our house as her
accepted lover. I sincerely believe that you will, as you say, make her
a good husband. Will endeavor to see your father in a day or two, and
explain to him what I can afford to do for my daughter.

                                                      Faithfully yours,
                                                      HENRY LONGSTREET.


=211. Answer to No. 209 (Unfavorable).=

                                                   E----, June 5, 19--.

  Edmund Keane, Esq.
    DEAR SIR:--

It is my firm opinion that you have been premature in speaking to my
daughter as you have done, without previously learning my wishes on
the subject. I am very much displeased with her for giving you any
encouragement, as she fully understood that it would be contrary to my
views were she to do so; however, it obliges me to tell you distinctly
that I decline to give my consent to any engagement between you, and am
not likely to alter this determination.

                                                      Yours obediently,
                                                      HENRY LONGSTREET.


=212. From a Gentleman, asking for His Father's Approval to His Recent
Engagement.=

                                                L----, August 10, 19--.

My Dear Father:--

I am not sure that you will be fully pleased with the contents of this
letter. I write to ask your consent to my marriage with Miss Ethel
Blake. I anticipate all your objections, but hope your affection for me
will induce you to waive them, and that my dear mother will use all her
influence with you in my behalf. Need not tell you how good and amiable
and charming Miss Blake is; you have seen enough of her in social
circles, in C----, to appreciate her many lovable qualities. She will
make the best of wives, and your and my dear mother's consent is all I
want to complete my happiness.

                                            Believe me, my dear father,
                                                 Your affectionate son,
                                                                 LEWIS.


=213. Answer to the Above.=

My Dear Lewis:--

                                                 B----, August 4, 19--.

In answer to your rather startling communication, must state at once
that it is quite out of the question that I should countenance your
engagement with Miss Ethel Blake. Have no doubt that she is all you
say, and what I have seen of her is quite in her favor, but you must
be reminded that you are not in a position to maintain a wife; you have
your own way to make in the world, and have no right to suppose that I
can allow you sufficient income to marry upon. I should be unjust to
your brothers and sisters were I to decide otherwise; and I beg you to
understand that you have nothing to expect from me if you persist in
your imprudence, which can only be regarded as a boyish infatuation.
Your mother sends her love, and says she is sure you will not be so
rash and foolish as to act contrary to my wishes.

                                 Believe me, my dear boy,
                                      Your true friend and affectionate
                                                                FATHER.


=214. From a Young Lady to Her Guardian, asking for His Approval of Her
Recent Engagement.=

                                               C----, January 17, 19--.

Dear Mr. Andrews:--

Since you called last, I have received a proposal of marriage from Mr.
Phillip Thompson, with whom you are slightly acquainted. He is very
much attached to me, and I have a great esteem and regard for him; so
much so, that I have told him I would endeavor to obtain your consent
to our engagement, and I trust you will see no reason for withholding
it. Mr. Thompson says he would be very pleased to explain his position
and prospects fully to you if you allow him the opportunity, and he
hopes that you will find both satisfactory. I thoroughly understand the
importance of the step I wish to take, but as my future happiness is
so deeply concerned in this matter, my earnest wish is that you will
return a favorable answer.

With all kind regards, believe me,

                                             Dear Mr. Andrews,
                                                  Very sincerely yours,
                                                      GERTRUDE MAYWOOD.


=215. Answer to the Above.=

                                               S----, January 10, 19--.

My Dear Miss Maywood:--

I am going to disappoint you greatly by stating that Mr. Phillip
Thompson would not be a desirable husband for you. Am sorry that you
should have allowed matters to go as far as they have, as I understand
from your letter that you almost accepted him. However, I have your
interest too much at heart to give my consent to a marriage which would
not ultimately be for your happiness, and you are possessed of too much
good sense to act contrary to my opinion. In my responsible position
as your guardian, I must advise you to the best of my judgment in what
affects your welfare; and, disagreeable as it is to me to oppose your
wishes, I feel it my duty to give you my firm opinion on this serious
subject.

If you desire it, I will myself communicate with Mr. Thompson.

                                Believe me, as ever, dear Miss Maywood,
                                      Your sincere friend and guardian,
                                                     ALFRED B. ANDREWS.


=216. From a Father to a Gentleman who has paid Marked Attentions to
His Daughter Requesting to Know His Intentions.=

                                                 G----, April 17, 19--.

DEAR SIR:--

I consider it my duty to ask you frankly what are your intentions
towards my daughter. Your manner toward her has evidently awakened a
deep interest in her affectionate heart. She has been too well brought
up to think of bestowing her love where it was not properly and fully
appreciated and returned, and I cannot allow her happiness to be
trifled with; therefore hope that you will see the propriety of at once
putting an end to a position embarrassing to her as it is painful to me.

                                      Awaiting your answer, believe me,
                                                 Yours very truly,
                                                      ADOLPHUS REDDING.


=217. Answer to the Above.=

                                                 G----, April 19, 19--.

DEAR SIR:--

I was greatly surprised at the receipt of your letter, and can only
hope you are mistaken in supposing your daughter to be interested in
me. I flatter myself that she regards me as a friend, and as such have
a sincere admiration and esteem for her; but it is my duty to say that
I entertain no feeling of love towards her, and that I have only paid
her such attentions as are due from a gentleman to a lady in whose
society he is frequently thrown. Under these circumstances, I conclude
you would wish me to discontinue my visits at your house and I shall do
so with much regret. With the kindest remembrance of the hospitality I
have there received and with compliments to Mrs. Redding,

                                                   Believe me,
                                                      Very truly yours,
                                                       ALFRED S. BAKER.

Attentions to His Daughter.=

                                               C----, January 10, 19--.

DEAR SIR:--

Permit me to say that your attentions to my daughter have become so
marked of late, that I wish them discontinued. I do not approve of
you as a suitor for her hand, simply on the ground of your pecuniary
position; and consider that you have not been acting fairly in
endeavoring to gain her affections, not being in a position to make
a comfortable home for her. I have my daughter's promise that she
will neither write to you nor see you without my consent. Relying
upon your honor to respect my wishes, and not to attempt any further
communication with her.

                                                    I remain,
                                                     Yours truly,
                                                      THOMAS D. CURRAN.

                                               C----, January 11, 19--.

DEAR SIR:--

I felt much pained surprise when reading your letter, just delivered,
as from the encouragement I have received to visit at your house and
from the manner in which I have been allowed to devote myself to your
daughter in public, at balls and parties and in society generally, I
was under the impression that Mrs. Curran and yourself tacitly approved
of my attentions to her.

It would have been kinder had you thought proper to signify your
disapproval six months ago, as my conduct must have been as patent to
you as to every one else. However, as your daughter acquiesces in your
views, I have nothing more to add beyond this, that I will respect your
wishes, and beg to remain,

                                                      Yours faithfully,
                                                       ARTHUR HATFIELD.

Gentleman, disapproving of the latter's Attentions to Writer's
Daughter.=

                                                  P----, June 14, 19--.

DEAR SIR:--

I am sorry to have to write to you on a somewhat delicate subject;
the fact is, your son has been paying my daughter Alice considerably
more attention than I think desirable, and a word from you would no
doubt put a stop to the matter. He has been on such a friendly footing
with my family that I did not apprehend that anything like a serious
attachment was likely to spring up between your son and either of my
daughters; however, from what I gather, such is the case.

I am sure you will agree with me that a marriage between my daughter
Alice and your boy would be most imprudent, if not altogether
impossible. I take for granted that he cannot look to you for an
allowance upon which to support a wife, while I am certainly not in a
position to do anything for my daughter; under these circumstances,
perhaps the best thing would be for the young people to discontinue
meeting for the present.

Were your son of age, I should take a different course with him; as it
is, I leave it to you to bring him to reason; should he be so foolish
as to persist, I shall make it a point that my daughter understands
that she is not to encourage him in his attentions. Counting upon your
kind and wise consideration of the matter,

                                                  I remain,
                                                      Yours faithfully,
                                                        WALTER HUBBARD.

My Dear Mrs. Winslow:--

I feel certain you will be pleased to hear that darling Mary is engaged
to be married to Mr. Sanford; he is the son of a very old friend of
ours, and everything we could wish as a son-in-law. It is delightful to
see how happy the young people are in each other's society; he is as
devoted to her as she is fond of him. Had it not been so, in spite of
our liking the young man so much, I doubt if we should have given our
consent, as at present his prospects are not very good, and they will
have to wait till next year before thinking of being married: thus you
see it is not yet a matter for congratulations, but I did not wish you
to hear the news from any one but me.

Believe me, dear Mrs. Winslow, with kind regards from my husband and
myself,

                                                  Very sincerely yours,

My Dear Mrs. Sanderson:--

We are all delighted to hear of your daughter's engagement and
sincerely wish her every happiness; please tell her so with my love.
It must be a great source of pleasure to you to know that she is going
to make so satisfactory a marriage, one of which you and her father so
highly approve. I shall hope to become acquainted with your future
son-in-law at an early opportunity, and you must tell me when the
wedding is to take place, as should I not be in town at that time, I
might yet embody my good wishes in the form of a suitable souvenir.

With kind remembrances to all,

                                              Sincerely yours,

My Dearest Girl:--

I know you'll be delighted to hear the good news I have to tell you
about myself: I am engaged to be married to Mr. Edward Lloyd, whom I
mentioned so often lately in my letters to you. I was not very much
surprised at his proposing, as I fancied he liked me, from his constant
attentions. You can imagine how happy I am; he is everything one would
wish one's lover to be. I am sure you will think he is handsome. I do,
of course, and every one says he is very clever. He is five years older
than I am, which mamma thinks is an advantage. I hope you will be one
of my bridesmaids, dear Madge; we are to be married very soon. He has
taken a nice house, and you must be one of our first visitors. Papa and
mamma are delighted at my prospects, and think Edward will make me the
best of husbands.

With warmest love, believe me,

                                                Your ever affectionate,

My Dear Fanny:--

How pleased I was to hear of your engagement. I want to be among the
first to offer you the warmest congratulations. Do tell me a good deal
more about your fiancé, and whether it is to be a long engagement.
I need not ask if you are very happy, as I am sure you would not
have accepted any one to whom you were not sincerely attached. You
will doubtless have to answer a great many letters from friends and
relatives, all desirous of wishing you joy, but still I hope you will
find time to write me a few lines soon.

With kindest love,

I wonder if you will be surprised to hear that I am going to be
married, and that I shall want your services on the occasion as best
man, but I will give you due notice when the day is fixed. In the
meantime, you may, if you please, congratulate me, as I consider
myself to be a very lucky fellow. She is one of the nicest girls in
the world--Fanny Sanderson. Didn't you meet her at the last Country
Club golf tournament? I get on very well with her people, and my future
father-in-law is inclined to be very liberal about money matters. So,
you see, it's an all-around delightful affair.

My Dear Marion:--

My son Phillip has suggested that I write you a few lines, and,
although we had not the pleasure of meeting each other, yet from all
he says I feel sure that he has chosen wisely. He has always been the
best of sons to me--so affectionate, tender-hearted, and considerate;
and you will understand something of the pride I feel in him, and how
dearly I love him, and how anxious I am that the one who is to be his
wife should value him at his true worth. It would be a great pleasure
to me if your parents would allow you to pay me a little visit, as I
much wish to make the acquaintance of my future daughter-in-law.

My son has shown me your photograph, so I have some idea as to what you
look like. He tells me how charming you are, and that he is certain I
shall not be disappointed when we meet. Dear Marion, my boy's happiness
is in your keeping, and I trust and pray you may be to him all his fond
mother could wish.

With kind love, I remain,

My Dear Mrs. Deering:--

It was most kind of you to write to me. I cannot help feeling a little
shy in answering your letter, but trust we shall not long remain
strangers to each other. Phillip has often talked of you, and is so
anxious that we should meet; but I am sorry to say mamma cannot spare
me just now, otherwise I should have been very pleased to have accepted
your kind invitation. I quite appreciate all that you say in praise of
your son, and think I love him almost as much as even a mother could
wish, and indeed you may trust me to do all in my power to make him
happy. Thanking you again for your kind letter, believe me,

My Dear Swift:--

I just received your kind invitation to attend your wedding on the 20th
of August. I am greatly delighted, but not much surprised to receive
this invitation. I have had my suspicions for some time that you were
growing weary of a bachelor's lonely miserable life. One by one, you
genial fellows are passing over to the realm of the married, and very
soon I alone shall be left to tell the sad story.

Well, I congratulate you with all my heart. You have had a successful
career; you have earned honor and competence in the battle of life, and
now you have won the "dearest girl in the world." God bless you, old
fellow, and make all your coming days bright and prosperous.

You may depend on my putting in an appearance on the 20th of August. If
the train fails, or the tires of my "bike" give out, the walking will
no doubt be good.

                                                      Ever, dear Swift,
                                                       Yours truly,
                                                         JAMES T. LORD.

                                                  A----, June 10, 19--.

My Dear Miss Rice:--

My marriage with Mr. Langdon is to take place on the 15th of next
month, and I write to say it would give me much pleasure if you would
be one of my bridesmaids. I thought of having eight--my two sisters
of course, Mr. Langdon's sister and a cousin of his, the two Misses
Whetherby, yourself if you will consent, and Miss Mordaunt.

We have not yet decided about the dresses, but I will let you know what
we settle upon as soon as I have your answer. We expect Miss Langdon
here to-morrow to talk the matter over with us.

With love to yourself and kind regards to Mrs. Rice, believe me,

                                                  Very sincerely yours,
                                                        SYLVIA MARSDEN.




CHAPTER III

BETWEEN ENGAGED PEOPLE


=230. To a Lady on Being First Accepted.=

                                                  M----, June 10, 19--.

My Dear Eva:--

I cannot tell you with what impatient anxiety I have been awaiting
your answer to my letter, and though you were too good to keep me long
in suspense, still the interval between writing to you and hearing
from you, was passed by me in alternate fear and hope--fear that I had
mistaken your feelings, and hope that perhaps you did care for me a
little. At present I can hardly realize the happiness of knowing that
I may soon call you mine; it is the fulfillment of my most cherished
wishes.

Believe me, dearest, it will be my one thought and care to render your
life a happy one, and if we both love and trust each other we may, I
hope, look forward to a bright future together. I was much gratified
by your father's message to me, and I shall hope to run down to R----
on Saturday next as he so kindly proposes. In the meantime, will you
not send me a photo of yourself that I may show it to my mother, who
is most anxious to know you, having heard from her son how sweet and
lovable you are?

                                                 I remain, dearest Eva,
                                                     Your devoted
                                                        EDWIN DRUMMOND.

My Dearest Maud:--

I am conceited enough to hope that you have become a trifle impatient
awaiting news from me. I arrived here last night rather fatigued from
a hurried journey and a rough crossing. I shall hope to find a letter
from you on my arrival at the Hotel du Palais, Paris. You may be sure
I shall not remain away from you a day longer than is absolutely
necessary to complete the business I have on hand, and you will, I
am sure, give me the welcome I deserve for having made such haste
to return to you. I picture you sitting under the chestnut trees on
the dear old lawn, and, I trust, thinking of me. Excuse a short note
to-day, I find it difficult to collect my thoughts. I leave this by the
evening mail.

Remember me to all your family; and believe me, dearest Maud,

                                                       Yours devotedly,
                                                           MAX DINGLEY.

                                                    O----, May 1, 19--.

My Dearest:--

Will you delight me by accepting the accompanying locket and wear it
for my sake? I shall be much pleased to hear that you like it, and only
regret that I cannot present it in person, but shall hope to see you
ere long. Excuse a short letter to-day, and ever believe me,

                                                  Yours affectionately,
                                                       HAROLD CUMMINGS.


=233. Answer to the Above.=

                                                    O----, May 2, 19--.

Dearest Harold:--

Thank you so much for the beautiful locket received this morning; I
admire it immensely, and shall indeed be pleased to wear it for the
sake of the dear giver. I should so like a good photo of you to put in
it. Will you send me one when you next write, or, better still, bring
it yourself? You can imagine how greatly I am looking forward to your
promised visit; will it not be very soon? it seems so long since we saw
each other. I trust, dearest Harold, you are quite well, and are not
overworking yourself with too much writing as you told me you had been
doing lately. How do you like your new quarters? Tell me everything
about yourself. I think you know how interested I am in everything that
concerns you.

All are well at home; my aunt thinks of remaining here another three
weeks. Until I have the great happiness of seeing you,

                                                   Believe me, dearest,
                                                        Yours lovingly,
                                                                LOUISA.

                                                O----, August 10, 19--.

Dearest Fred:--

You have expressed a most complimentary desire that I should write you
a long letter in answer to yours. It is a great happiness to me to
do so, and to know that you care to hear of all my thoughts, hopes,
and wishes. I have read your letter again and again; the assurance it
contains of your affection is very precious indeed. Dear Fred, do you
really love me as much as you say you do? I ought not to doubt it,
but still it seems so strange and new that I should have the power of
winning the heart of one so good and clever as you are. I am very proud
that it did happen; my heart is full of thoughts of you, and every
hour of the day I look forward to being with you again. I try, oh so
earnestly, to fit myself for the position that awaits me as your wife,
that you may never regret your choice.

                                                   Ever affectionately,
                                                                   EVA.


=235. From a Gentleman to His Fiancée.=

                                               C----, January 10, 19--.

My Own Dearest:--

It is nine o'clock, and I am just home from the office. You see I am
working hard. My only thought, all the time is not for myself, but for
us. You won't forget it, darling? Do you dream sometimes of the little
home we have planned? Can you not see it all? Is it not worth waiting
for? Oh, dearest, do not forget that you have drawn my whole heart out
of me--that it is all in your keeping, and that you are mine, mine. I
live only in you, night and day, waking or sleeping. I love you so that
it is pain not to have you, not to hold you.

Yesterday night our friend Max took me around to a reception or
party or something of the kind at his fiancée's, Miss Lord. It was a
very pretty affair, the ladies were in full dress, and the house was
decorated in green and red. Miss Lord was a gracious hostess, and
couldn't have done more than she did to make it pleasant for me. I had
a delightful evening, and I certainly told her so; but I was thinking
only of you all the time--you in your little pink gingham under the
apple tree. Do you remember? It was May, and the sun was setting, and
I kissed you for the first time without being scolded for it. You are
not sorry that you didn't scold me? Think hard, dear, and tell me when
you write. And do so, very soon. You know how I watch the mails, and
how disappointed I am when the longed-for letter isn't there.

Good-night, my beloved, my precious little one.

                                                       Yours devotedly,
                                                                EDWARD.


=236. Answer to the Above.=

                                               L----, January 13, 19--.

Dearest Edward:--

The snow is twenty inches deep, and we are almost buried. Jim brought
me your letter this morning. He was quite exhausted ploughing his way
up to the house. "Thought it would pay me, Polly," he said, "to see
the love-light in your eyes." Dear, lonely old Jim, so faithful and
unselfish! Mother brought him in and gave him a cup of coffee. I don't
know why it is, Edward, but sometimes I want to share my happiness
with everybody, and then again I like to feel that it is exclusively
my own. It is splendid of you, Edward, to be working so hard, and I am
proud, and proud that you love me. I have also been working hard since
yesterday morning. You could never guess at what. Mother and I have
been cataloguing and arranging the books in the school library; you
cannot imagine what a task it was. And this evening Mr. Melville is
coming around to consult with mother about library methods, and how to
manage the circulation of the books. I am going to ask him to mail this
letter for me, so must finish it as quickly as possible.

Yes, Edward, I do remember that May sunset from under the apple tree.
It is very long ago. We were only children. I didn't know what love was
then--how deep and strong. Beloved, I never forget you, never pause in
my loving of you.

                                                               Your own
                                                                  MARY.


=237. Another Letter from a Gentleman to His Fiancée.=

                                              S----, December 14, 19--.

My Darling:--

All day in the store, and then the long evening in my room alone, that
is my outward life. And my inward life--it is you, only you, for I
think of you all the time.

The rush of business is increasing as the holiday season draws near;
such hurrying, scurrying crowds of people, and only one little girl in
all the wide world that I want. And my arms ache for her to-night.

Eva, dear, your last letter is worn quite to tatters from being carried
in my pocket and pulled out for frequent re-reading. You would laugh if
you could see it, and take pity on me and write me a new one.

Tell me, darling, what you are doing. Have you finished reading Romola?
Do you like it! Are you keeping up your practicing? Did you have a
good time at the sleighing party? Who was there? A regular string of
questions, isn't it? You know everything you write interests me, and I
like the little details most of all. Your letters are little fragments
of you. I kiss them and treasure them most sacredly. O darlingest,
dearest girl, I love you and long for you. Tell me, dear, can't you
feel me loving you even though you are so far away? And do you love me?
I like to have you say so. And how much? But, ah! you are too far away.
I can't hold you until you laugh and have to tell.

Every night and every morning I thank God that I have found the
dearest, truest girl that ever was, and that she has given me her
promise to be mine. Dearest, I think of it every hour. Nothing can ever
separate us. Am wholly, wholly yours, and you are mine to love and
cherish.

                                         With a heart full of devotion,
                                                     Yours ever,
                                                         ALFRED HINMAN.

                                              M----, December 16, 19--.

Dear Alfred:--

My walk to the office this morning after papa's mail was well rewarded
by your letter. Charlie Darwin was there posting eight dozens of his
circulars. He is perfectly jubilant over his prospects, and he had to
walk home with me to tell all about them. He said he was going along my
way, and if I didn't mind, as it was very slippery--Of course I said I
didn't, so I put your letter into my pocket and waited for a good time
to read it.

It's very funny how you wear my letters out so soon. I wonder why they
don't make note paper like the tough paper that is used in little
Paul's Baby Goose picture book.

I had a fine time at our Church Fair last night. Mrs. Sullivan changed
her mind at the last, and had me serve as Rebecca at the Well, while
Maggie presided at the candy booth, just as she had wanted to. Guess
how many glasses of lemonade I sold. One hundred and seventeen. Charlie
Darwin drank eight. Do you think you could have swallowed as many as
that, Alfred?

I am keeping up my practicing pretty well, that is, I practice an
hour a day, except the days I write to you. Would you rather have me
practice _every_ day? You know, I am keeping up my piano only because
you are so anxious to have me, and I want you to be satisfied. People
think I am getting on very nicely.

The sleigh ride was grand. All the girls went, and nearly all the boys.
Phillip Small could not get permission to go. It was a perfect shame.
Every one missed him. We had a fine supper at the Davidsons' old place.

Oh, Alfred, I wish you could come home for Christmas. It will be so
lonely and dismal for you, away off by yourself, and it won't seem at
all like Christmas here without you. How I long to see you! There is so
much to tell. Do you remember last Christmas, dearest? Mamma is trying
to send me to bed, so I must stop writing. But I haven't answered all
your questions. Oh, Al. dear, are you never satisfied? What do you
suppose Charlie said to me this morning? "Daisy, you're all heart--just
one big heart." Doesn't that sound like him? And there wasn't anything
to lead up to it. I was weighed last Wednesday at the butcher's. Guess
how much? 122 pounds. There, mamma is calling. Good night, Al. But I
was going to answer your question how much I love you. If Charlie and
the scales spoke the truth I think about 122 pounds. But then, Charlie
was only joking. He doesn't mean half he says. Do you think so?

                                                      Your affectionate
                                                                 DAISY.

Day.=

                                               N----, October 30, 19--.

My Darling Alice:--

Don't you think we have been engaged quite long enough to understand
each other thoroughly, and do you see any good reason for delaying
our marriage? I have not pressed you before on this point, but if you
really love me as I think you do, you will consent to make me happy by
naming an early day. Why should we not be married immediately after
Christmas? this would give you time for any preparations you may have
to make, while, as for myself, I should be quite ready to receive my
dear little wife next week, if she would only come to me. Dearest
Alice, will you consult your mother? I feel sure she will say I am
right in asking you not to put off our marriage any longer. Cannot
possibly get away from here for the next ten days or so, but do write
and tell me it shall be as I wish.

God bless you, darling.

                                         Your affectionate and devoted,
                                                       ALBERT THURSTON.

                                               F----, November 3, 19--.

Dearest Albert:--

Your affectionate letter touched me deeply. You asked me a very
momentous question, to name the day of our marriage. Dear Albert, it
shall be as you wish; your arguments are so convincing I can only feel
that you are right, and say yes to all you propose. My mother also
thinks that the 28th of December would not be too soon, and that I can
make all my preparations within that time; therefore let it be the
28th. The period of our engagement seems very brief, indeed, but I have
such perfect trust in you, and we know each other so thoroughly, that I
need not postpone our marriage with the idea of seeing more of you, and
can look forward to our passing a very happy life together.

Good-bye, dearest Albert; fondest love

                                                          From your own
                                                                 ALICE.


=241. Answer to the Above (Unfavorable).=

                                               F----, November 2, 19--.

Dearest Albert:--

I only wish I could write as you suggest, but really there are many
reasons against our marriage taking place just at present. We have, as
you say, been engaged some time, but three months is, after all, a very
short period in which to learn the tastes, feelings, and ideas of one
who is to be life's dearest companion; besides, we have seen so little
of each other, and I cannot help feeling that this period of our life
is perhaps the sweetest and pleasantest we may ever experience. Married
life will bring cares and responsibilities with it, and I would prolong
my present happiness as long as possible. You must not be angry with me
for saying this, dear Albert, or for being rather reluctant to exchange
happy certainty for the unknown future. My mother will not influence me
either way, but allows me to judge for myself. She will be happy to see
you here when you can arrange to come to us for a few days, and you and
I can then talk the matter over, and perhaps your arguments may prove
more convincing than mine, in which case I shall give way.

In the meantime, believe me, as ever,

                                                      Your affectionate
                                                                 ALICE.

Postponement of their Marriage.=

                                              N----, November 30, 19--.

My Dear Albert:--

A few weeks ago, when I promised that our marriage should take place
in December, I fully intended to keep my word, but on consideration,
feel compelled to ask you to let it be postponed for a few months
longer. I have no good reason to urge for this delay--perhaps I am
over-sensitive and anxious, but still, if you would agree to it I
should be very grateful. It strikes me we entered upon our engagement
rather hastily, and that I was persuaded against my better judgment to
fix next month for our marriage. I think it will be better for both of
us that we should endeavor to learn more of each other's tastes, and
what each requires of the other. Your line of life is so decided that
I wish to be certain it will suit me exactly, or that you would meet
me in some degree with little concessions to my individual tastes. I
have written to you out of the fullness of my heart, and trust you will
not misunderstand me, or think I do not love you. My request is for a
little more time, which I am sure you will not refuse me.

Believe me, dear Albert.

                                                 Your ever affectionate
                                                           ALICE WHITE.

                                              S----, February 10, 19--.

Dearest Alva:--

Do you not realize how miserable you make me by the way you have acted
recently? You cannot suppose it is very pleasant for me to see you,
day after day, encouraging the attentions of other men. At the party
last night you appeared to prefer every man in the room to myself
as partner. If you acted in this way with the idea of arousing my
jealousy, let me tell you it is a very dangerous game to play at; but I
imagine nothing so flattering to myself was intended, and that a love
of admiration and indifference to my feelings were the motives that
actuated you. If this is the case, it would be best for both of us that
our engagement should be at an end; if, however, you are able to assure
me that you meant nothing by your thoughtless coquetry beyond the
amusement of the moment, you shall never again hear a word of reproach
from me on the subject, and I will trust you as fully as before.

Believe me, dearest,

                                    Your ever faithful and affectionate
                                                       PHILIP DORRIMER.

                                               C----, January 15, 19--.

My Dear Paul:--

For some time past I have been trying to make up my mind to put my
anxieties into words, but have shrunk from doing so, hoping that
perhaps it was all a mistake; now I can no longer delude myself into
thinking this is the case. I feel you are very much changed, your
manner to me at times almost amounting to indifference. Your letters
are short and cold, and but few words of affection can be extracted
from them. I am beginning to think you no longer care for me; perhaps
this is what you wish me to understand. And yet it is hard to believe
this of you; it must be that something or some one has estranged you
from me, and that an explanation between us will put things on their
former footing; anyhow, I give you now the opportunity of telling
me everything, and implore you to be frank, as our future happiness
depends upon our never allowing any misunderstanding to stand between
us.

Believe me, dear Paul,

                                                      Your affectionate
                                                                 MADGE.

My Dear Charles:--

May I hope that you will not think me foolishly exacting if I say that
you have pained and hurt me by the attentions you so constantly offer
to Mrs. Dunstable? I do not suppose you mean to vex me, and have no
doubt it is more her fault than yours, but still I wish you would be a
little less _empressé_ in your manner to her. You will think perhaps
that I am jealous; it is not quite that, but yet I have a sort of
feeling that you ought not to be so nice to her. You will not be angry
with me for saying this, dear Charles; it is my great love for you
that causes me to attach such importance to every look and word of
yours, and to feel reluctant that other women should share them with
me. You must not say that this argues a want of trust in you unworthy
of us both; indeed, I do trust you, otherwise my self-respect would
not allow me to write so frank a letter as this one is. Perhaps I have
only to tell you what is in my heart for you to give me no further
cause for--shall I say jealousy? although I have tried to leave this
unpleasant word out of this letter.

Always, dear Charles,

                                                            Your loving
                                                                 LAURA.

                                                   W----, May 19, 19--.

My Dear Laura:--

I do not deserve, in any degree, the reproaches contained in your
letter of yesterday, and am surprised at your permitting yourself to
indulge in such feelings. Great as my attachment is, I must tell you,
once for all, that I detest jealousy in a woman, and should soon cease
to care for one who tormented me by repetition of such accusations.
If, during our engagement, you are to feel aggrieved at my offering
the slightest civility to any lady of my acquaintance, what chance of
happiness is there in store for us in married life? I can see nothing
but wretchedness ahead if you persist in giving way to this feeling;
dismiss it from your mind, it is not worthy of you, and remember that
perfect trust is what I expect and desire from the one who is to become
my wife. I feel strongly on the subject, as so much alienation and
misery are occasioned by unfounded jealousy.

Believe me, my dearest Laura,

                                          Ever yours,
                                                CHARLES P. WORTHINGTON.


=247. Answer to No. 245 (Conciliating).=

                                               W----, January 12, 19--.

My Dearest Laura:--

How foolish of you to underrate your own attractions so far as to think
I could prefer any one to yourself! Do not entertain such a thought
for a moment. My heart is wholly yours, and not a thought of mine is
bestowed upon any one else. I did not in the least intend to convey
anything beyond mere politeness by my attentions to Mrs. Dunstable;
but if you think that I have inadvertently given you the least cause
for uneasiness, you may depend upon my being very much on my guard in
future, so as to avoid the faintest suspicion of a preference for the
society of any young lady, save yourself, be she ever so charming.

Believe me, dearest Laura,

                                                   Your deeply attached
                                                               CHARLEY.

My Dear Ethel:--

Do you really mean to break off your engagement with me? I can only
suppose it is so from the way you allow Mr. Small to devote himself
to you. It seems every one is aware he is paying you more attention
than, under the circumstances, you ought to receive from any man
except myself. Either he is ignorant of the engagement between us,
or he is dishonorable enough to act thus in spite of it. If you have
not sufficient regard for my feelings and for your own position as my
promised wife, to put an end at once to any further acquaintance with
Mr. Small, you will understand that I resign all pretensions to your
hand; but should be sorry to think that you had changed so completely
in the last few weeks as to care for me no longer. My sentiments have
not altered towards you, in spite of all that has passed; and it rests
with you to say whether you prefer that man to myself. I shall of
course abide by your decision, and remain,

                                                      Yours very truly,
                                                        GEORGE LINDSAY.

My Dearest Girl:--

I feel entirely satisfied, from the explanation you have given me, that
my jealousy was unfounded, and I must ask for your forgiveness for
having doubted you. Am afraid my accusations must have pained you very
much, and I deeply regret writing as I did; but you are so good and
gentle, am sure you will receive me into favor on my promising never to
offend again in a like manner. You must not be very angry with me for
fearing to lose what I prize so dearly, the love of my darling Helen.

Once more, dearest, forgive me, and believe me

                                                           Your devoted
                                                                EDWARD.

My Dearest Howard:--

I have been so wretched, of late, thinking you did not care for me as
you used to, that the joy of receiving your letter, and learning that
I still hold the first place in your heart, has been almost too much
for me, and made me shed such happy tears. It is so hard to doubt one
you love, and it seems that I have tormented myself quite unnecessarily
all these past weeks; still you must admit there was some excuse for
my making myself miserable. What was I to think from your silence, and
from all that was said? Dearest Howard, believe me, I will never doubt
you again, never, never, and shall always think you are the kindest,
dearest, best, and truest of men, and that you are all my own.

Now and always,

                                                            Your loving
                                                                  ANNA.

My Dear Mr. Felton:--

I well know how delicate a matter it is for a third person to interfere
in lovers' quarrels, but as the happiness of my daughter is at stake,
it is my duty as her mother to try and bring about a reconciliation
between you. I will not question which of you is at fault; all I wish
is to see the smiles return to my child's face, and tranquillity to her
heart. She is evidently very unhappy, but tries to conceal it even from
me. Dear Mr. Felton, if you really love her, as I am sure you do, you
will come to Katherine on receipt of this letter, and you need have no
fear of your welcome. Trusting you will not misunderstand the feeling
that actuates me in thus writing to you,

Believe me,

                                                  Very sincerely yours,
                                                   ANNA DURAND DE WITT.




CHAPTER IV

BREAKING OFF ENGAGEMENTS


=252. From a Gentleman to His Fiancée Asking Her to put an End to Their
Engagement.=

                                               D----, January 19, 19--.

My Dear Susan:--

I have hesitated long before writing to you on a rather delicate
subject, but trust you will not be hurt or offended if I say that our
tastes are so opposite, that married life under such circumstances
could not fail to result in unhappiness to both of us. Your heart is
evidently set on the enjoyment of all the gaieties of life, while my
ideas are centered in domestic quiet and repose. I have neither the
means nor the inclination to enter into the former, and you would
hardly content yourself with the latter. You cannot but acknowledge the
truth of my statement, and I have no doubt you will see the necessity
of putting an end at once to an engagement that is in every way
unsuitable.

Believe me, dear Miss Belden,

                                                      Very truly yours,
                                                         FRANK B. RICE.


=253. From a Young Lady to Her Fiancé Putting an end to Their
Engagement.=

                                               A----, December 5, 19--.

Dear Charles:--

It is only after much serious thinking that I write you this note. Some
time you will thank me for it.

Is it not better, in a matter that concerns the happiness of two
lives, to undo a mistake at any cost than to wait until too late? We
thought once that we truly loved each other, but we have found, during
the period of our engagement, that in many grave respects we are not
congenial. Our tastes, our aims in life, our ideals are so diverse,
that I believe our union could not be perfectly happy. When you review
in your mind the occurrences of the past months, I am sure you will
agree with me. It is not necessary to place the blame. Perhaps there
has been no fault but hastiness. Considering everything, I would
suggest that our engagement cease by mutual consent, and our friendship
continue as far as seems agreeable and natural. We shall have many
pleasant memories and some sad ones in common. The latter, in time,
will be forgotten.

                                           Yours sincerely,
                                                    FLORENCE LUDINGTON.


=254. Answer to the Above.=

                                               C----, December 7, 19--.

Dear Florence:--

I cannot but think that you regard our little differences too
seriously. In fact, I look upon them rather as misunderstandings than
differences. But since you suggest it, I consent that we call our
engagement broken for the present. I agree to it only because you want
to feel perfectly free, and I do so in good faith; _you are free_.
Whatever the end, I shall never blame you; my faith in your sincerity
and true nobility stands undiminished. In my own mind I consider our
engagement as merely suspended. Doubtless time will show you what mere
trifles--nothings, we might say--are dividing us. It was not lightly,
my darling, that I gave you my heart.

Yours as ever, with love and devotion,

                                                      CHARLES DAVIDSON.

                                                  T----, July 22, 19--.

Dear Mr. Lawrence:--

You will not feel surprised at the contents of this letter; indeed, you
have hardly left me any alternative than to say our engagement is at an
end. Perhaps I ought to have arrived at this decision sooner, but was
reluctant to give you up until quite sure it was the right thing for me
to do. I could not be happy with one whom I did not esteem as well as
love, and by your conduct of late you have forfeited my good opinion,
and have destroyed my faith in you. Your letters are herewith returned
and I beg that you will send mine back; kindly acknowledge also receipt
of the presents you have made me at different times.

Believe me,

                                                  Yours truly,
                                                       MADELINE STORRS.

Account of a Change in Her Feelings toward Him.=

                                              N----, February 10, 19--.

Dear Harry:--

I want you to believe that I am sincerely grieved at the pain this
letter may occasion you, and trust you will not think harshly of me for
what I am about to say. I did not rightly understand my own feelings
when our engagement took place, and mistook esteem and friendship for
love. Much as it costs me to make this confession, it is my clear duty
to tell you I can never entertain the affection for you that one has a
right to expect from a future wife.

This knowledge has made me very unhappy, but I have now determined to
ask to be released from my promise; dear Harry, forgive me; I feel
convinced that some day you will be as happy as you deserve, although
it is not in my power to make you so.

Believe me, with unwavering friendship,

                                                  Yours very sincerely,
                                                        CARRIE DUNMORE.


=257. From a Gentleman to His Fiancée Offering to Release Her from
Their Engagement.=

                                                 P----, August 7, 19--.

My Dear Evelyn:--

I exceedingly regret to tell you that my darkest fears have been
realized; the business disaster of which I have spoken to you has
come, and it is more complete than our worst expectations had led us
to believe. We have fought a long, hard fight, and, as honorable men,
there was nothing else for us to do but to close our doors and put our
affairs in the hands of our creditors.

Whether the firm will resume, or what the course of the future will
be, is yet undecided. For myself I am not greatly troubled. As long as
youth, health and hope remain, I am not afraid of the coming struggle.
But there is one direct duty before me in relation to you that must be
performed without delay. Under the most promising circumstances, it
will be a very long time, perhaps years, before I could offer you the
home and comfort on which my heart was set, and concerning which we
have had so many and such delightful conversations; and it would not be
fair to hold you to your engagement under these altered circumstances.
I beg you, therefore, to consider yourself perfectly free to act in
this matter as your judgment and heart may dictate. I will not trust
myself to say what I feel on this subject further than this, that in
offering you perfect freedom I am following the only honorable course
due to you and to myself.

Shall be very busy evenings at the office for two or three days, but
will call upon you on Friday night and we can talk matters over.

Ever, dear Evelyn,

                                                Yours truly,
                                                        MARTIN STANLEY.


=258. Answer to the Above.=

                                                 P----, August 8, 19--.

My Dear Martin:--

Your letter of yesterday was duly received. It made me very sad, and
yet proud of you. You are proving so honorable and chivalrous! I am
deeply sorry for this business failure. But cheer up. You have, as
you say, youth on your side, and you are lacking neither in brains
nor in courage. These are treasures that nothing and no one can
wrest from you, and with them the future is bound to turn out bright
and prosperous. I understand you wish me to act in relation to our
engagement as my judgment and heart dictate. This is like you, Martin.
Well, come around on Friday and we shall discuss the subject. In the
meantime, be assured that no one sympathizes with you in this day of
difficulty more than

                                                      Your affectionate
                                                                EVELYN.

                                                  S----, June 14, 19--.

Dear Mr. Martin:--

It is with my daughter's consent that I write you this letter, and my
painful duty is to tell you that, as there seems no prospect of your
being able to make a home for her, it is cruel and unfair to hold
Alva to a promise which has now lasted over two years. You have not
fulfilled any of the pledges you voluntarily made, and which induced
me to sanction your attentions. I understand that your family are
not inclined to do anything for you, and therefore see nothing for
my daughter but years of weary waiting, probably to end in ultimate
disappointment.

If you have any regard for her welfare, you will, I am sure, release
her from her present trying position, and accept my decision for her
good without endeavoring to shake her resolution. I must ask you to
send me a few lines of acquiescence; and with every wish for your
success in life,

Believe me, dear Mr. Martin,

                                                  Truly yours,
                                                         ALTHEA LUDLOW.

Engagement.=

                                               C----, October 10, 19--.

SIR:--

Circumstances that have just come to my knowledge compel me, as a
matter of duty, to break off the engagement between my daughter and
yourself. I have desired her to hold no further communication with you,
and I have been sufficiently explicit to convince her how unworthy you
are of her affection and esteem. It is unnecessary for me to give you
the reasons which have induced me to form this judgment, and I only add
that nothing you can say will alter my determination.

                                                       FELIX DUSENBURY.

Edward Renwick, Esq.




PART IV

SOCIAL INTERCOURSE

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS

The act of writing a social letter is to many people a task of some
little difficulty from various points of view. They are at a loss as
to the most fitting manner in which to express that which they have to
communicate, and one, two, and three sheets of note paper often bear
witness to their attempts and failures. Either at the commencement or
at the finish, it strikes them that something is not as it should be,
or, right in the middle, they come to a deadlock altogether. Others,
again, have not the intelligence to discover for themselves that their
letter is not up to the regulation standard of notes in general, and
have to face criticism and even ridicule. In writing letters, it is
curious to observe how closely certain sets of words and expressions
are followed by the generality of people; they accept them as models,
and adhere to them. But phrases in letter writing change, as everything
else changes, and what was strictly polite and proper to write under
given circumstances some twenty or thirty years ago is not quite the
thing to say to-day.

To commence a letter to a comparative stranger, or to a person with
whom the writer is but slightly acquainted, is the first difficulty
to overcome. Shall it be a letter or a note, written in the first or
in the third person? This is to many a perplexing question, and yet
there need be no doubt on this point, as there are safe rules for every
one's guidance in such matters. In all communications with strangers,
it would be correct to write in the third person. A very slight
acquaintance, however, would authorize a letter being written in the
first person if it were to be of any length.

It is an accomplishment to write a good letter, and one of which few
can boast, while to write a bad one is so general a practice that the
receipt of a good letter almost amounts to an agreeable surprise. With
regard to the composition of a letter, it should always be remembered
that if it has a reason for being written, this fact should not be
lost sight of or over-weighted with a mass of extraneous matter. It
is also idle to devote the first paragraph of a letter to trivial
excuses for not having written sooner, when a still longer delay
might have been allowed to elapse if it suited the convenience of the
writer; still, when a letter requires an immediate answer, it is a
matter of politeness to give the reason for the delay, but this should
be explained without circumlocution. It is when girls are merging
into womanhood and boys into manhood, that want of fluency in letter
writing is acutely felt; and this awkwardness often continues in after
years. Some are more conscious than others of their deficiencies in
this respect, and to write a letter or even a simple note is to them
a trouble and a bore; later on they take refuge in the fact that they
are bad correspondents, and they use this statement as an excuse for
writing very short letters or for not writing at all. Many people
confess when obliged to write letters, that they have no idea what to
say beyond the preliminary phrase; they are afraid to trust their pen
with their thoughts, for fear of getting out of their depth and of not
being able to recover themselves without becoming more or less involved
and hazy as to grammar. A well-expressed letter creates a pleasant
feeling of gratification; it is often read twice, and if not put by
amongst other missives, considered worth keeping, it is destroyed with
some regret. One charm of a good letter lies, perhaps, in its being
personally considerate; another, in its clearly calling to mind the
individuality of the writer.

Inquiries after health should be made with discretion, always
remembering that some are thin-skinned on this subject, while others
like to discuss it at length. A clever writer keeps his affairs very
much in the background unless they are at a crisis, when they would of
course possess interest of an unusual character; otherwise to relate
trivial matters for the sake of having something to say is foolish and
egotistical. In these days, people do not accuse themselves of writing
stupid, dull, or uninteresting letters, as their friends are only too
likely to take their confessions at their own valuation and to endorse
the written verdict; while the affectation of laying the blame of bad
writing on pens, ink, and paper is now considered as a most inadequate
and absurd excuse. In answering, it is a proof of a poor imagination
to minutely paraphrase each paragraph of the letter under treatment.
Questions naturally demand answers, and important facts call for
comment; but trivial remarks and observations, perhaps pleasantly put,
should not be returned to their author with poor platitudes attached to
them.

Letter-writing may be said to be divided into notes and letters.
Formerly a note written in the third person invariably commenced with,
"Mrs. Jones presents her compliments to Mrs. Brown"; but now the words
"presents compliments" have fallen into disfavor; and, whenever any
other opening phrase can be readily substituted, it is in better taste
to use it. Indeed, it may be taken as a rule that compliments are only
presented to a complete stranger, or officially, or professionally
speaking; and whenever an acquaintanceship exists, even of the
slightest possible character, other expressions are used in preference
to the words "presents her compliments." The nature of the note itself
would probably determine the most appropriate expression wherewith to
commence it.

There are few people careless or ignorant enough to lapse from the
third person into the first in the course of a short note; but still
it is worth guarding against. Notes are principally confined to the
briefest of communications, as the frequent and necessary repetition of
the pronouns--she and her, for instance--or the surnames of the writer
and recipient of the note becomes tedious; and when it is imperative
to write in the third person, it is most desirable to construct each
sentence with a due regard to an extravagant use of pronouns, and never
at any time to resort to the vulgar expedient of attempting a sort of
compromise by making the initial letter of the writer and of the person
written to do duty for their respective names and surnames.

It is observable that a cramped style, or a small Italian hand-writing,
is no longer in vogue, and, when seen, appears very much out of date.
The prevailing mode of writing is bold and free. A frequent use of
capitals is also indulged in, which gives a dash of originality and
spirit to a letter when not over-done.

It used to be an idea that to underline words in a letter was rather
bad style; but now, if a writer wishes to be very emphatic, or to call
particular attention to any remark, an additional stroke of the pen is
not objected to; it is a liberty not to be taken, however, when writing
to those with whom one is on ceremony.

Many people experience a certain difficulty in the choice of a
conventional term with which to conclude a ceremonious letter, and it
must be admitted that there is not much variety at command, "Yours
truly," "Yours sincerely," "Yours faithfully," "Yours obediently,"
with the addition perhaps of the adverb "very," being the principal
formulas in use; and it is on the whole immaterial whether "truly"
or "sincerely" is employed when writing to friends. The affectionate
expressions addressed to still dearer friends and relations are left
to one's personal feelings, and yet many devoted husbands make use of
the cold, formal words "Yours truly," when writing to their wives, in
preference to any more endearing phrase.

In order not to conclude a letter too abruptly, it is usual, before
the words "Yours truly," to add one or other of such phrases as these:
"Believe me, dear Mrs. Jones," or "I remain, dear Mrs. Jones," or
"Believe me, dear Mrs. Jones, with kind regards," and this gives to
a letter a certain finish and completeness which would otherwise be
wanting.

An error of punctuation in a letter will often cause a sentence or
paragraph to be misunderstood, and made to convey the reverse of what
was intended.

Question marks should not be omitted from a letter when questions
are asked, though many consider it a waste of time to use them. An
exclamation point, when required, materially assists the clearer
understanding of a passage, which without it might not possess so
emphatic a meaning.

Another practice of the past, now happily discarded, is that of
crossing letters; only a school girl, nowadays, would cross and recross
a sheet of writing paper, and two sheets of paper are used if one sheet
will not contain all that is to be said. If half the second sheet
of paper is left blank it is not torn off, a whole sheet being more
convenient to hold and to fold, and if a few last words are necessary
for the completion of a letter they are written on the margin and not
across the writing on the face of the pages.

In social correspondence it is, often, considered good form to write on
the first and third pages of a sheet of note paper, leaving the second
and fourth pages blank, or to write on the fourth and first pages,
leaving the other two unwritten upon. This is done for the convenience
of having the letters written without using a blotting pad. A
postscript was formerly supposed to convey the pith or gist of a lady's
letter--a poor compliment, it must be confessed, to her intelligence;
it is now considered a vulgarism to put P. S. at the bottom of a letter
containing the few last words; if something is remembered when the
letter is concluded that should have been said, it is added without the
two capitals in question.

In addressing envelopes, the address should be written legibly in the
center of the envelope, and not run off into the corner, leaving a
third of the envelope blank.

     _Angular Handwriting_

    _This is a sample of Ladies' Angular hand. It is perfectly legible
    when written correctly, is capable of great rapidity, and should be
    executed with a stub pen._

    _It is easy to aquire, easy to write and seems especially adapted
    to the feminine hand and its requirements._

  Robert S. Howland, Esq.,
    Hotel de France.

      DEAR SIR:--

I am instructed by the United States Minister to acknowledge the
receipt of your letter of yesterday's date, requesting the honor of
presentation to His Majesty the King, and I beg to inform you in reply,
that your name has been entered on the list for presentation at the
R---- Court on the next opportunity.

                                              I remain,
                                                  Yours obediently,
                                                     PHILIP LIVINGSTON,

=263. A General Letter of Introduction.=

                                              T----, November 14, 19--.

To Whom It May Concern:--

The bearer, Mr. Phillip Allen Taylor, of this city, having retired
from a business that has proved eminently successful, is about to
enter upon an extensive tour of travel. It has been for many years a
cherished dream of his to visit, when released from business cares, the
chief cities of his native land, and especially to wander through the
majestic scenery of the far West. His plan has extended of late, and,
unless the fatigues of travel should prove detrimental to his health,
he may visit China and Japan, spend a winter in India, and return home
by way of Europe. If in the course of these wanderings he should be
fortunate enough to meet any of my numerous friends, especially in
Florence, Paris, London or Glasgow, I trust this note will serve as a
kindly introduction. Mr. Taylor is a whole-souled gentleman, and any
kindness shown to him I shall consider a kindness shown to myself.

                                             Your ever faithful friend,
                                                  FRANCIS THURMAN BOYD.


=264. From a Lady Asking for a Letter of Introduction.=

                                              N----, December 28, 19--.

Dear Mrs. Leonard:--

I make bold to ask if you would mail me an introduction to Mrs. Johnson
Lathrop; I believe she is a great friend of yours, and should much
like to know her. She gives charming musical parties, and has a large
acquaintance among distinguished artists and literary people.

As you know, we came to this city to reside permanently, and,
especially for my daughter's sake, I should like our circle of
acquaintances to broaden in the right direction.

Accept my heartfelt thanks in advance, and, with kind regards to
yourself and Mr. Leonard,

                                            Believe me,
                                                  Very sincerely yours,
                                                         MARY DINSMORE.

                                             S----, September 10, 19--.

My Dear Mrs. Graham:--

Some very charming people, friends of ours, Mr. and Mrs. Symonds, have
taken a house in C----, No. 10 B---- Square, with a view of residing
there permanently, and I should think it very kind if you would call
on them. At present they find C----, socially speaking, rather dull,
as they know hardly any one in the city, and it would make all the
difference to them if they had a few pleasant acquaintances among your
best people. I thought if you could show them any civility you would
perhaps do so. You cannot fail to like Mrs. Symonds; she is a very
pleasant woman, and she has written to me to ask if I had any friends
in your city I could introduce her to.

                                         With kind regards, believe me,
                                                  Very sincerely yours,
                                                          ELMIRA WHITE.

                                               A----, November 7, 19--.

My Dear Mrs. Lloyd:--

We expect to start for Europe next week, and intend passing the winter
abroad. I think you told me you knew a great many people there, and I
should be most grateful for one or two letters of introduction to any
French or American families, as it would make our stay so much more
agreeable if we made some pleasant acquaintances in Europe. Are you
thinking of going to the south of France this winter? or do you feel
strong enough to stand the Boston climate? I expect we shall find it
very cold in Paris; is this your experience? Remember me kindly to Mr.
Lloyd, and

                                              Believe me,
                                                Very truly yours,
                                                   HENRIETTA STONEBURY.

                                               M----, December 3, 19--.

My Dear Helen:--

Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Lane, dear friends of ours, will probably visit
S----, on their wedding tour, and I have taken the liberty of asking
them to call upon you during their stay in your city. They are very
charming young people whom you will be delighted to know. I have
spoken so often to them of you, and your dear husband and children,
that they will scarcely deem themselves strangers. Any kindness you
may be able to show to them during their brief visit I shall accept as
shown to myself.

We trust you are all well. M---- is not very far from S----, and yet,
for all chances of our meeting, it seems as though we might just
as well be millions of miles apart. Give my love to all your happy
household and believe me,

                                                   Dear Helen,
                                                     Yours as ever,
                                                        ELFRIDA DUNLAP.


=268. From a Father Introducing His Son to a Minister.=

                                               M----, October 10, 19--.

  Rev. Alexander McNaughton,
    N----.

      Reverend and Dear Sir:--

Will you, very kindly pardon the liberty I take in introducing my
youngest son, Matthew, to your notice? There is no doubt in my mind
that the father's heart within you will understand and appreciate my
solicitude on his behalf. Matthew has always been a good and obedient
boy, but he is now leaving the quietude and shelter of a country home
to face the varied and testing experiences of life in a great city. We
have no fear but he will conduct himself in a manner worthy of his home
and of his early training; at the same time I feel it my duty to do
all in my power to secure for him the best influences and the happiest
surroundings; and have, therefore, allowed myself to send him directly
to you. He has been urged by me to attend your church, and we shall all
be very grateful if you will introduce him to the young people of your
congregation. He will probably feel lonely for a little while, but my
mind will be much at rest concerning him if I know that he is forming
wise and helpful friendships. I shall be very grateful for any kindness
shown to my boy as he starts out to fight the battle of life.

With heartfelt thanks in advance, I remain, dear sir,

                                                      Very truly yours,
                                                       GEORGE D. MOORE.


=269. From a Lady Introducing a Friend to an old School Mate.=

                                               E----, November 7, 19--.

My Dear Susan:--

Mrs. Henry Pursell--whose charming friendship I very highly prize--is
about to remove from our pleasant suburb to your beautiful city. I
take this opportunity of commending her and her husband, and their
delightful little family, to your kindly sympathy. We have not
forgotten how gentle and considerate you always were to the new pupils
at dear old B---- Academy. What a comfort you were to the homesick and
the heartsick! Mrs. Pursell will be an entire stranger in S----. I
therefore bespeak on her behalf a touch of that old-time sympathy and
love.

                                                 Ever yours faithfully,
                                                        ETHEL WILLIAMS.


=270. From a Gentleman Introducing a College Chum to a Sister.=

                                               P----, October 20, 19--.

My Dear Mabel:--

Mr. William Perry, the bearer of this note, is one of my old college
chums. At college we were regarded as "Damon and Pythias," though which
was Damon and which was Pythias I hardly know. Anyway, you will find
Mr. Perry as noble a fellow as ever ate three meals a day. Give him a
hearty welcome for my sake, and you will soon regard him very highly
for his own.

I assure you that in showing kindness to my old classmate you are
liable to entertain an angel unawares. Give my regards to that "model
husband" of yours, and tell my hopeful nephew that the next time I come
to C---- I will bring him either a jackknife or a Bible--perhaps both.

                                                   Your loving brother,
                                                                ROBERT.


=271. From a Lady Asking for a Subscription to some Charity.=

                                                   E----, May 23, 19--.

  Campbell Astorbilt, Esq.
    DEAR SIR:--

I know how generous you are in subscribing to any deserving charity,
and also know how many are the claims made upon you for assistance; but
I will venture to ask for a subscription for our Firemen's Children's
Orphan Asylum, which is very much in need of support. Allow me to add,
that the institution is a most excellent one, and that we should be
very grateful for any donation, however small, as there is a great
deal of illness about just now, and the Infirmary is not equal to the
demands made upon it. I take the greatest interest in this charity, and
am doing all in my power trying to help it on in its beneficent work.

Hoping that this request will not be judged impertinent, and trusting
in your kindness of heart,

                                       I remain,
                                             Yours sincerely,
                                               MARY FENTON FAIR,
                                                  President F. C. O. A.


=272. From a Young Lady to a Girl Friend Asking for Her Photograph.=

                                                 O----, August 7, 19--.

Dear Florence:--

I have just been admiring such a nice photograph of you in Mrs.
Dutton's book; she said it had been taken quite recently. May I ask for
a copy before you have given them all away? and, in exchange, will send
you one of my last new photographs in a few days. Mrs. Dutton is very
good-natured, and often asks me to afternoon tea.

Mamma is waiting for me to go out with her, so, with love,

                                            Believe me,
                                                  Affectionately yours,
                                                       MARIETTA DUNLAP.

                                                B----, August 12, 19--.

Dear Marietta:--

Am so sorry all my new photographs had been given away before I
received your letter, otherwise would have sent you one with pleasure.
I intend ordering a few more copies as soon as we return to town, and
will not forget to let you have one. Please send me yours. I am so glad
you like Mrs. Dutton; she is, as you know, a great friend of mine, but
we have not seen each other for some time. Give her my love and with
much to yourself,

                                              Believe me,
                                                  Yours affectionately,

=274. Asking a Gentleman to be Godfather.=

                                                 T----, March 10, 19--.

Dear Mr. Graham:--

I cannot tell you how much we should be gratified if you would consent
to be godfather to our little son. Mr. and Mrs. Richardson have
promised to be the other sponsors, and the christening is to take place
on the 23d of April, at St. Mark's Church. We intend having a luncheon
party on that day in honor of the event. Should you be too much engaged
to be present, my husband would represent you at the church, and
perhaps you would be able to look in at the luncheon. We should be much
pleased to see you.

With our united kind regards, believe me,

                                            Very truly yours,
                                                  KATHERINE DRED WOODS.


=275. Answer to the Above.=

                                                 N----, March 12, 19--.

My Dear Mrs. Woods:--

Shall be most happy to act as godfather to your little boy since you
and your husband are kind enough to wish it, and I hope he will grow
to be as good a fellow as his father. You must not expect me at the
church, but will try and drop in in the afternoon.

With kind regards to you both,

                                                      Very truly yours,

=276. Asking a Lady to be Godmother.=

                                                  L----, July 11, 19--.

Dear Mrs. Ronalds:--

It would be a great pleasure to us if you would be godmother to our
little girl; we have named her after you, Katherine Mabel. She is a
sweet little thing, and I shall be so proud to show her to you. My
sister, Mrs. Mabel Phillips, is also to be godmother, and my husband's
brother will be godfather. I will let you know what day the christening
will take place as soon as it is decided.

With kindest remembrances from my husband and myself,

                                              Believe me,
                                                  Very sincerely yours,

Dear Mrs. Lamont:--

I hope that you will not think me unkind if I ask you to excuse me
from undertaking the office of godmother to your little daughter. The
truth is, I do not feel justified in incurring what, in my mind, is too
great a responsibility. I have always thought that the parents and near
relatives of a child are most fitted for the post of sponsors, as, on
account of their position they have a better opportunity of fulfilling
the promises made in its name than those less near to it could possibly
have. Other people, no doubt, think differently, but these are my
views, and you will not, I am sure, be offended at my thus frankly
expressing them. Shall hope to come and see you soon, and your dear
little girl.

                                              Believe me,
                                                  Very sincerely yours,

                                             N----, September 20, 19--.

My Dear Mrs. Rice:--

How very much we enjoyed our little visit to you last week, and the
charming drives and walks we had! My husband says he does not know
when he has spent a pleasanter time, he is so fond of the country and
country amusements, and I assure you we both thoroughly appreciated
your tireless hospitality and kindness. I had heard so much of your
place and was quite anxious to see it; it really is one of the
prettiest country homes I have ever seen, and how perfect you have made
the villa! Everybody calls it a triumph of good taste. We are going
into Berkshire in October to pay a few visits, but we shall be in town
again early in November, to remain there for the whole of the winter,
and I hope, if you think of coming up before Christmas, you will let me
know.

Remember us kindly to Mr. Rice, and believe me, with renewed thanks,

                                                  Very sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Tillotson:--

I am grieved to have to inform you that my mother is very seriously
ill. She begs me to say it would be a great comfort if you would come
and read a little with her, if you could spare the time. In any case,
I should be very glad to think she had seen you, as it is her earnest
wish to enjoy this privilege.

                                                      Faithfully yours,

Dear Doctor Bellows:--

Will you do me the favor to come to my house immediately for the
purpose of baptizing our little boy, who has just been given up by the
physicians. We are very anxious to have him baptized, as I fear there
is not the faintest hope of his recovery.

                                                      Faithfully yours,

                                              F----, February 10, 19--.

Dear Mr. Vane:--

It would be most kind of you to inform me, in strict confidence,
if you know anything of a Mrs. Jessica Turner; she has applied to
me in writing for assistance, but I make a point, if possible, of
ascertaining how far the person applying for help is deserving, as I do
not approve of indiscriminate charity, considering it likely to do more
harm than good. Perhaps I had better send you her letter, and if you
are not personally acquainted with her, would you oblige me by making
inquiries among your parishioners?

                                          Believe me,
                                               Very truly yours,
                                                  GRACE TAYLOR SANFORD.


=282. From a Lady to Her Pastor, Concerning a School Treat.=

                                                       Hawthorne Villa,
                                                       August 10, 19--.

My Dear Pastor:--

I have been informed by one of my fellow church-members, Mrs. Dudley,
that you propose giving a treat to the children of the Sunday school.
It shall give me much pleasure to place my grounds and the adjoining
field at your disposal for that purpose, and I will be happy to provide
a substantial tea for the teachers and the ladies connected with the
school. With compliments to yourself and your dear wife,

                                               Believe me,
                                                      Yours very truly,
                                                          LUCY HALDENE.


=283. To a Young Lady, Presenting Her with Flowers.=

                                              N----, December 12, 19--.

Dear Miss Eustis:--

May I have the great pleasure of offering you the accompanying flowers?
I have chosen red roses with long stems, as you intimated, in my
presence, that you preferred them to any other.

                                                 Believe me,
                                                      Very truly yours,
                                                          WARD MCVEAGH.


=284. From a Gentleman to a Lady Sending Her a Song.=

                                              N----, December 20, 19--.

Dear Miss Eustis:--

It gives me great pleasure to send you a new song heard the other
evening, and which, I think, you will like. I fancy it will suit your
voice very well, and shall look forward to the pleasure of hearing you
sing it.

                                                 Believe me,
                                                      Very truly yours,
                                                          WARD MCVEAGH.


=285. Answer to the Above.=

                                              N----, December 21, 19--.

Dear Mr. McVeagh:--

A thousand thanks for the song you were so kind as to send me; have
tried it over and like it immensely. Was it very well sung when you
heard it, and shall I be able to do justice to it in your opinion, when
I have the pleasure of singing it to you?

                                           Believe me, in the meantime,
                                                  Very sincerely yours,
                                                       ELEANOR EUSTICE.


=286. From an Elderly Gentleman to a Young Lady, Offering Her a
Birthday Present.=

                                               S----, October 10, 19--.

My Dear Miss Stilton:--

With my most hearty wishes for many happy returns of your birthday,
please accept a little souvenir which I hope you will like; at your age
a birthday is an event to celebrate and to rejoice over; at mine it has
a different signification, and reminds me that I am one year nearer the
end; in youth, one does not dwell upon this thought, but rather upon
what the bright future has in store. May it contain everything for you
that your dearest friends could wish.

                                   With love, believe me,
                                          Your affectionate old friend,
                                                    JAMES T. SWINBURNE.


=287. Answer to the Above.=

                                               S----, October 12, 19--.

Dear Mr. Swinburne:--

In my surprise and delight on receiving your lovely present, I hardly
know how to thank you enough for it. How kind of you to remember my
birthday! Believe in my earnest gratitude for all your good wishes.
Among my several nice gifts, there is none I shall value more than
yours, dear friend. We are to have a little dance to-night in honor of
the event, and I shall have the pleasure of showing these beautiful
tokens of friendship to my particular chums.

With renewed thanks, believe me,

                                                  Affectionately yours,
                                                         DAISY STILTON.


=288. From a Gentleman to a Lady, Enclosing Tickets to an
Entertainment.=

                                              C----, November 27, 19--.

Dear Miss Landon:--

I have secured two tickets for the concert at the A---- Theater on
Saturday next, in the hope that you may perhaps like to make use of
them, and allow me to be your escort on that occasion. It is to be a
very good one, and well worth going to.

Please give my kind regards to Mrs. Landon, and believe me,

                                                      Faithfully yours,
                                                         ARNOLD DWIGHT.


=289. Answer to the Above (Acceptance).=

                                              C----, November 28, 19--.

Dear Mr. Dwight:--

Thank you so much for your invitation to the next Philharmonic concert.
I shall be very pleased to go with you to the A---- Theater, on
Saturday next. You will find me ready to start at 7:15 that evening.
Again thanking you,

                                                 Believe me,
                                                   Very truly yours,
                                                       MARIETTA LANDON.


=290. Answer to No. 288 (Regrets).=

                                              C----, November 28, 19--.

Dear Mr. Dwight:--

To my great disappointment, I cannot accept your very kind invitation
for next Saturday, on account of a prior engagement entered into over
a week ago. Doubtless it would have proved a most enjoyable evening.
Hoping that you will not be long before calling upon us, and with
renewed thanks and regrets,

                                              Believe me,
                                                 Very truly yours,
                                                       MARIETTA LANDON.


=291. To an Invalid, from a Stranger, Offering Her Fruit and Flowers.=

                                               C----, November 3, 19--.

Mrs. Grancy has the pleasure of sending Miss Weymouth some early
California grapes, in the hope that they may be acceptable, as she
understands Miss Weymouth is a great invalid; she also sends her a few
flowers, and trusts she will have no hesitation in accepting both with
all good wishes for her restoration to health.


=292. Answer to the Above.=

                                               C----, November 4, 19--.

Miss Weymouth is very grateful to Mrs. Grancy for her lovely present.
The flowers are indeed beautiful, and the grapes most delicious; she
begs to send her best thanks for this thoughtful attention. She fears
that there is but a very remote prospect of her being restored to
health, but she is just as much obliged to Mrs. Grancy for her good
wishes.


=293. Asking for an Invitation to a Ball for a Friend.=

                                                 S----, March 24, 19--.

Dear Mrs. Deane:--

If your invitation list is not already filled up, might I ask you
if you would give me a card for Miss Joyce, the daughter of a very
old friend of mine? She much wishes to come to your ball, and I have
promised to ask you this favor. Should you be able to grant it, she
would come with me.

I must apologize for trespassing on your kindness in this matter, but
you will not hesitate to refuse if your list is already overfull as
regards ladies.

                                                  Believe me,
                                                      Very truly yours,
                                                        MAUD SILVERTON.


=294. Unfavorable Answer to the Above.=

                                                 S----, March 27, 19--.

Dear Mrs. Silverton:--

To my extreme regret, I cannot send the card you request as my ball
list is filled up to overflowing; indeed, I have been obliged to leave
out many of my own acquaintances who ought, really, to have been
included.

Should I have any refusals at the last moment, I will let you know, but
fear there is very little chance of it.

                                 Believe me,
                                        Very truly yours,
                                               GABRIELLE FORSYTH DEANE.


=295. From a Lady asking for an Invitation to a Dancing Party for a
Gentleman.=

                                                   B----, May 30, 19--.

Dear Mrs. McLeod:--

Would you do me the pleasure of asking Mr. Edward May to your dance?
He just told my husband that he would be charmed to attend it if I
could get him a card, and as he is very fond of dancing, he might be an
acquisition should you be short of gentlemen.

I think you have met his married sister, Mrs. Dinsmore, at my house;
she is an intimate friend of mine.

                                             Believe me,
                                                  Very sincerely yours,
                                                      GERTRUDE S. BOYD.


=296. Asking for an Invitation to Amateur Theatricals for Visiting
Friends.=

                                                   N----, May 18, 19--.

Dear Mrs. Leonard:--

Mr. and Mrs. Read, of S----, who are old friends of mine, are visiting
at my house now, and have heard so much of your forthcoming theatricals
that if you could spare them an invitation, I know they would greatly
appreciate the favor. Thanking you sincerely in advance,

                                                 Believe me,
                                                   Faithfully yours,
                                                       CAROLINE DAWSON.

CHAPTER III

CONGRATULATIONS,[1] CONDOLENCES, RESIGNATIONS, ETC.

=297. From a Lady Addressing Birthday Congratulations to a Friend.=

                                                 D----, March 14, 19--.

My Dear Old Friend:--

I have not forgotten that the 16th of March is the anniversary of
your birth. I should not like the day to pass without assuring you of
my deep and sincere interest in all that concerns you. Our paths lie
widely apart, but just such occasions serve as happy opportunities
for the interchange of kindly feeling, and the revival of many happy
memories. I hope this brief note will reach you on the 16th, also a
little token of affectionate regard which I have wrought with my own
hand. Pray accept it, not for its own value, but for the sake of the
thoughts it represents.

                                                      Faithfully yours,
                                                          ELVIRA JONES.


=298. Condoling with a Friend about His Failure in Business.=

                                                L----, August 17, 19--.

My Esteemed Old Friend:--

We were exceedingly pained to learn from the newspapers of yesterday
that, after a long struggle, you have been compelled to yield to the
resistless pressure of these hard times. Success in business is often
a mere accident and merits little praise, and in like manner, failure
in business is often the sad and only return for a long and patient
fight against tremendous odds. In these days of merciless competition,
the spirit of fair trading seems to be almost buried out of sight. It
is no longer a case of "the survival of the fittest," so much as of
the survival of "the smartest." But we should not let undeserved defeat
bring despair. As the poet says:

    "Hope springs eternal in the human breast,"

and I most sincerely trust there are brighter days in store for you. We
feel sure you can have nothing to blame yourself for in these reverses.
Everybody who knows Alfred Baker knows that he is the soul of honor,
that he holds integrity by the right hand and by the left.

I exceedingly regret that my letter must be one of words only, and wish
it were possible to ask you to draw upon me for some useful, helpful
amount. But that is utterly beyond my power. Letters are not of much
value in such a crisis as you are now passing through, and yet we could
not keep silent.

Pray accept these few words of heartfelt sympathy. Be brave! Be
hopeful! Better days will come.

                                                      Very truly yours,
                                                         PHILLIP SMITH.


=299. Informing a Wife of the Illness of Her Husband.=

                                             B----, September 10, 19--.

Dear Mrs. Oldfield:--

I have been asked by your husband to write and tell you he has a bad
attack of gout and cannot use his right arm; he feels quite helpless,
and hopes you will come to him at once. We are taking every care of
him, and he has a very good doctor, but of course he would be very glad
to have you with him, and although we have not yet had the pleasure of
meeting, I hope you will not make any ceremony about staying with us
until your husband is quite well again. We shall be very pleased to see
you in spite of the unfortunate circumstances which occasion your first
visit to us. With best regards from Mr. Densmore and myself,

                                               Believe me,
                                                 Very truly yours,
                                                       SYLVIA DENSMORE.


=300. Informing a Gentleman of the Illness of His Wife.=

                                                S----, August 20, 19--.

Dear Mr. Lord:--

I am personally unknown to you, but your wife is a great friend of
mine, and on calling upon her, this morning, I found that she was
seriously ill. Of course, you ought to know of this at once, and I
would have sent a telegram, but the doctor said there was no immediate
danger, and that you had better be informed of her illness by letter.
The landlady of the boarding house where she is staying seems very
attentive and kind, still it would certainly be a great comfort to Mrs.
Lord if you could bring her sister down with you. In the meantime, I
will do all that is possible for her, and am happy to say she has the
best advice our place can furnish.

                                    Believe me,
                                          Yours sincerely,
                                                     LINA STEPNEY GORE.


=301. Informing a Married Daughter of the Illness of Her Mother.=

                                              T----, November 15, 19--.

Dear Mrs. Lester:--

I am very sorry to have to inform you that your mother has caught a
very severe cold; the doctor seems anxious about her, and says it is
an attack of bronchitis. She has been in bed for the last three days,
but would not let me write before for fear of unnecessarily alarming
you; however, to-day, being no better, she has desired me to do so. The
doctor is coming again to-morrow, and should there be a change for the
worse I will send you a telegram after he has seen her. She is very
restless at night, and cannot be persuaded to take any nourishment
beyond a little milk. I came here on a visit last week, with the
intention of returning home yesterday, but did not like to leave your
mother as she was so ill.

With kind remembrances, believe me,

                                                      Very truly yours,
                                                            IDA SMYTHE.


=302. Inquiring after the Health of a Lady's Husband.=

                                                  R----, April 4, 19--.

Dear Mrs. Leverett:--

I sent over this afternoon to inquire after Mr. Leverett, and was very
sorry indeed to hear he is no better, and that you are very anxious
about him; but I trust there may be shortly some improvement in his
condition. Pray do not think of answering this note; I merely write to
assure you of my sympathy, and to say how happy it would make me to be
of use to you in any way; I would of course call at once if you cared
to see me.

With kindest regards, and very best wishes for your good husband's
quick recovery,

                                             Believe me,
                                                  Very sincerely yours,
                                                           ALVA BELDEN.


=303. Indirectly Inquiring after the Health of an Invalid.=

                                                  C----, June 10, 19--.

My Dear Mrs. Keane:--

I heard yesterday for the first time, through some friends who have
just returned home from P----, that your sister was seriously ill when
they left V----; however, I hope that you have received a better report
of her during the last few days, and that there is no further cause for
anxiety. When you write will you say everything that is most kind from
me, and please tell her I thought it best not to trouble her with a
letter until we heard how she was, as we know how trying it is after a
severe illness to answer letters of inquiry.

                                           Believe me,
                                                  Yours most sincerely,
                                                             ADA YOUNG.


=304. Sympathizing with a Confirmed Invalid.=

                                                S----, August 27, 19--.

Dear Mrs. Silverton:--

I was deeply distressed to learn from your niece, Gertrude, of your
continued indisposition. Had hoped that by this time you would
have been fully restored to health. But the ways of Providence are
inscrutable, and all we can do is to bow in submission to the Divine
will, assured that these chastenings of affliction are not sent in
anger, but are proofs of a loving Father's care. "His paths are in
the sea, and His footsteps are in the deep waters." He causeth "all
things to work together for good" to those who put their trust in Him.
But I need not remind you of these sources of comfort in the day of
your trial and sorrow. Your long experience in the Christian life will
suggest to you a thousand secret springs of gracious consolation. It
is not necessary to assure you how ardently we all desire your speedy
return to health. With tender sympathy and many earnest prayers

                                             I am, dear Mrs. Silverton,

=305. From a Daughter, Announcing the Death of Her Mother.=

                                                   D----, May 18, 19--.

Dear Aunt Mary:--

You must, doubtless, be prepared for the sad news I have to convey,
the death of my dearest, most precious mother. It took place yesterday
afternoon at four o'clock. Father is too broken-hearted to write
himself. We were all with her, and she was conscious to the last. Will
you and uncle be able to attend the funeral on Saturday next? Please
excuse this short letter, dear aunt, as I am really too upset to write
connected sentences.

                                                  Your sorrowful niece,
                                                            LINA BLACK.

Husband.=

                                                   F----, May 17, 19--.

Dear Arthur:--

You will have received my telegram telling you that my dear husband
was sinking fast. The change for the worse took place quite suddenly
last night, and this morning at six o'clock he died. I am too miserable
to write more, pray come to me if possible; there is so much to be
arranged, and I feel quite unequal to giving the necessary directions
for the funeral.

                                                   Your unhappy sister,
                                                       JULIA C. DUDENY.

                                                  P----, July 28, 19--.

My Dear Mrs. Lovering:--

I was deeply grieved to hear of the death of your husband, and write
to offer you my sincerest sympathy. At present, I have no doubt, you
can hardly realize your loss, and the blank made in your life must be
very terrible to bear; you were so much to each other, and appeared to
be so truly happy in your married life. By and by I trust the care of
your boy will give you an interest in life, but fear you must be too
miserable as yet to take comfort even from this.

                                            With kind love, believe me,
                                              Your affectionate friend,
                                                     HARRIET SINGLETON.


=308. Answer to the Above.=

                                                R----, August 12, 19--.

  My Dear Mrs. Singleton:--

Thank you ever so much for your touching letter; the loss of my dear
husband has left me unspeakably desolate, and I can hardly bear to
write of my sorrow as yet. I feel too broken-hearted to do anything but
sit down and cry helplessly. Of course I ought to rouse myself, but the
knowledge that he has gone from me forever, and that henceforward I
shall be alone, deprived of his loving care, is all that I can realize.
By and by my duty toward my child will give me something to live for,
but at present I can only mourn, and pray for resignation.

                                       Believe me, dear Mrs. Singleton,
                                                  Yours in great grief,
                                                    GEORGIANA LOVERING.


=309. Condoling with a Gentleman on the Death of His Wife.=

                                                  C----, July 10, 19--.

Dear Mr. Stevens:--

It seems almost cruel to intrude upon you in your great sorrow, but I
cannot delay writing how much my husband and myself sympathize with
you. We saw the announcement of the death of your dear wife in the
"Journal," and were greatly shocked, as we had not even heard of her
illness. Pray do not think of answering this letter; I only wanted to
say that our hearts are with you, in this severe bereavement, the more
sad since your dear little girls are thus deprived at so tender an age
of a loving mother's care.

With our united kind regards and deep sympathy,

                                       Believe me,
                                             Very truly yours,
                                                    ADA B. CHAMBERLAIN.


=310. Answer to the Above.=

                                                  C----, July 17, 19--.

My Dear Mrs. Chamberlain:--

Please accept my heartfelt thanks for your kind letter of sympathy.
My dear wife's death has left me utterly miserable, and her loss to
me is irreparable. She was the dearest and best of women, and the
void created in my life is, indeed, most terrible to bear. My darling
children are scarcely old enough to understand all the misery of the
present moment.

Remember me kindly to your husband. I remain,

                                                     Sorrowfully yours,
                                                         JAMES STEVENS.

                                                  P----, April 3, 19--.

My Dear Mrs. Heywood:--

I was deeply concerned to read, in the Paris edition of the "N----
Y---- H----," about the death of your brother. Although you have not
seen much of him of late years, still of course his loss must have
been a great shock to you. I remember him a handsome, most promising
young fellow; how sad that he should thus be cut off in the prime of
life! Have you heard any particulars beyond the fact of his death? I
suppose his poor young wife will return at once to her own people, as
he has left two children. I am truly grieved for you all; and with kind
regards,

                                    Believe me as ever,
                                          Your affectionate old friend,
                                                      EDGAR SAUNDERSON.


=312. Answer to the Above.=

                                                   O----, May 10, 19--.

Dear Mr. Saunderson:--

Please accept my most earnest thanks for your kind letter of
condolence. My poor brother's unexpected death was indeed a great shock
to us. All that we have as yet heard is that he was ill only three
days, and that enteric fever was the cause of death; his wife was too
overwhelmed with grief to write more fully, but we trust we shall hear
from her by next mail. Her father is very anxious that she should
come back to us at once with her children. John and I were such great
friends up to the time of his marriage, it seems too sad to think that
I shall never see him again; we were fond and proud of him too, and his
sudden death is inexpressibly terrible to us all.

With kind love believe me, dear Mr. Saunderson,

                                                  Yours affectionately,
                                                   MARY LAWSON HEYWOOD.


=313. Condoling with a Young Lady on the Death of Her Mother.=

                                                P----, October 3, 19--.

My Dear Margaret:--

I was deeply grieved to hear from you of the death of your dear mother,
and I can well imagine how greatly you must miss her every hour.
You have one consolation, however, that of having been the best of
daughters to her, and having given her the most devoted care during her
long illness. In such a trial as this, little can be said to comfort
you, and time alone will soften your sorrow for the loss of the kindest
of mothers. In her death I have lost a dear friend, and indeed all who
knew her cannot fail to regret one who was so amiable and unselfish.
Have you made any plans as yet, and what does your brother wish you to
do?--are you to live with him or with one of your mother's relatives?
I shall be much interested to hear what you propose doing, and if you
would care to come to us for a quiet visit, do not hesitate to say
so. Mr. Standish unites with me in sending you and your brother the
expression of our profound sympathy.

                                             Believe me, dear Margaret,
                                              Your affectionate friend,
                                                     HELEN H. STANDISH.


=314. Condoling with a Friend on the Loss of Her Child.=

                                                  D----, Nov. 17, 19--.

My Dear Mrs. Jackson:--

I never felt so much at a loss to express my feelings. If only I could
tell you all that is in my heart! It seems to me that in the presence
of your great grief, silence is the only suitable offering. How deeply
I sympathize with you no words of mine can tell, and to utter the
common words of condolence would serve no end in your case.

    "For common is the common place,
    And empty chaff well meant."

One only hope can comfort you in these sad hours, the hope that
somewhere in the "many mansions" of our "Father's house," the daughter
who loved you with all the sweetness of her early affection loves you
still. The shadows of the valley of death cannot eclipse the light of
love.

Time, the great healer, will bring balm to your wounded spirit. I have
just been reading the poems of Horatius Bonar, and I recall a stanza
of his that expresses better than any words of mine could do the calm,
divine hope of a reunion of the loved and lost in that fair land that
lies beyond the boundaries of time. It runs thus:

    "Where the faded flower shall blossom,
    Blossom never more to fade;
    Where the shaded sky shall brighten,
    Brighten never more to shade,
    Where the child shall meet her mother
    And the mother meet her child;
    And dear families be gathered,
    That were scattered on the wild----
    Dear ones, we shall meet and rest,
    Mid the holy and the blest!"

May the hope of a future reunion be your hope, and comfort, and stay.

                                             I am, my dear Mrs. Wilson,
                                                  Ever yours sincerely,
                                                           EVA ROBERTS.

                                               L----, January 28, 19--.

Dearest Emma:--

I only accidentally heard last night of the death of poor Mrs.
Fredericks; she was a great friend of yours, and you must have been
very grieved and upset when the sad news reached you. You were so fond
of her that no doubt you felt as if you had lost a near relation, and
very naturally, as she was beloved and admired by all who knew her. I
do so pity the husband, and the little motherless girl.

I hope you are enjoying good health; we have all been suffering from
colds lately.

                                         Believe me, dear Emma,
                                               Your sympathetic friend,
                                                       MAUD DILLINGHAM.


=316. Answer to the Above.=

                                               P----, February 1, 19--.

My Dear Maud:--

Poor Mrs. Fredericks' death has indeed caused a blank amongst her many
friends, but none of them will miss her more than I shall, as we were
brought up together and were quite like sisters. I cannot tell you how
greatly her loss affects me; she was so much to us in every way, such a
dear, dear friend. Her husband seems heart-broken, he thinks of going
abroad for a few months, and his little daughter is to remain with me
during his absence.

Excuse my not writing a longer letter to-day, and believe me, dear Maud,

                                                      Your affectionate
                                                           EMMA CARTER.

DEAR SIR:--

I have been requested by Mrs. Judson to inform you that the funeral of
her son, the late Mr. Edgar Judson, is to take place at Grace P. E.
Church, on Saturday, the 17th instant, at 12 o'clock, and to say that
she would be grateful if you could attend the services.

                                                Believe me,
                                                    Yours respectfully,
                                                          HENRY FOSTER.

Dear Mrs. Carson:--

I was deeply shocked to hear of the death of my valued old friend, Mr.
Carson, and beg to offer you my sincere sympathy. I much wish to attend
the funeral, unless you desire that only relatives should be present.
Perhaps you will kindly let me know your decision on the subject, and
when and where the ceremony is to take place.

                                                  I remain,
                                                      Very truly yours,

Dear Uncle James:--

By this time you have surely received my telegram containing the sad
news of my dear mother's death. My father is quite overcome with grief
at the suddenness of the blow that has fallen upon us all, and is
therefore unequal to writing himself, but he wishes me to say that
the funeral is to take place on Saturday next, the 10th instant, at 2
o'clock, at the North Baptist Church, and he hopes you will attend if
possible.

With our united best love, I remain, in deep grief,

                                              Your affectionate nephew,
                                                        HERBERT REEVES.

Dear Aunt Julia:--

I can hardly find words to tell you how deeply we were shocked and
grieved to hear of my dear kind uncle's death. You did not say when
the funeral is to take place, but please let me know, as I much wish
to attend it and to pay this last mark of respect to one for whom we
entertained so deep and sincere an affection.

Believe me, dear aunt, with much love,

                                                 Your sorrowful nephew,
                                                          JAMES WARNER.

My Dear Mrs. Norris:--

Mr. Sunbury and I have much pleasure in accepting your kind invitation
to dine with you on the 18th instant. I was so sorry to miss seeing you

till after five. Hoping to be more fortunate the next time you call,

We are extremely sorry to be unable to accept your kind invitation to

Dear Mr. Dwight:--

Will you give us the pleasure of your company quite informally at

Dear Mrs. Cole:--

It will be a great pleasure for me to dine with you on Saturday next,
the 10th. I should have called on you before this, but have been so
much occupied since my return to town, that I had not a moment to pay
any such civilities, to my great personal regret.

I would have been delighted to accept your kind invitation to dine

I am sorry I cannot have the pleasure of lunching with you on Monday

give my kind regards to the old friend you mentioned,--I have not an
idea who he--or she can be.

Dear Mr. Starling:--

I enclose a card for a tea at my house, on March 10th, and hope so much
you will be able to come. I wonder whether you would recite something
during the afternoon? It would be most good-natured if you allowed
yourself to be persuaded to do so.

I should be delighted if you and friends in your house would drive over

Dear Mrs. Meredith:--

It will give us great pleasure to drive over on Monday next to join
your tennis party, weather permitting; an occasional shower would not
prevent our coming, and only a thorough downpour could keep us away.

I am so sorry that we are unable to accept your kind invitation for

Country Club on that day. My brother desires me to convey his regards

Dear Mrs. Moffat:--

Mr. Livermore and myself should have found it a great pleasure to
accept your kind invitation to accompany you to the theater Friday

If I remember right you said, last Saturday, that you would like to

I should much enjoy going to the theater one day next week, and it is

Will you come to our house to-morrow at 9 o'clock and spend the evening
with us? We mean to have a game of cards and a little music. I am sorry
we cannot ask you to dinner, as we are in the midst of our periodical
servant trouble; but I thought perhaps you might like to come to us in

My daughters would have been delighted to accept the invitation to your
dance, had we not decided to leave the seashore for Lenox at the end of
this week, which will preclude their having the pleasure of doing so,
much to their regret. I am sure your dance will be a great success, and
I am only too sorry that none of us can be present.

                                           Believe me,
                                                  Very sincerely yours,
                                                        LUCILE STANTON.

My Dear Miss Lovering:--

It would be very charming, indeed, if you and your brother could come
to a little dance on the 20th, which mamma is going to give in honor
of my birthday. I hope you will be able to accept this invitation. We
shall begin dancing soon after nine o'clock.

                                            Believe me,

Thank you very much for your kind invitation, which my brother and I
have much pleasure in accepting.

Dear Mr. White:--

I take much pleasure in enclosing a card for a dancing-party we intend
giving on the 1st of March, as I have just heard that you were at
home again. I hope you will be able to come, and if your cousin, Mr.
Stevens, is staying at your house shall be very glad if you bring him
with you.

                                               Sincerely yours,

Dear Mrs. Winslow:--

I shall certainly come to your dance on the first of next month, when I
expect to be back from Florida. My cousin is leaving for Europe on the
20th, so I shall not be able to bring him along. With many thanks for
your kind invitation and regrets in the name of Mr. Stevens, believe me,

                                          My dear Mrs. Winslow,
                                              Yours obediently,

                                                D----, August 14, 19--.

Dear Mr. Lloyd:--

We are planning a garden party at the Laurels for Thursday evening
next, and it would afford us all great pleasure if you could make
it convenient to be with us on that occasion. We hope for a goodly
company. The Dixons, the Mathers, the Wilsons, the Broadbents, and a
host of other friends with whom you are well acquainted, are expected.
The reception will be given in honor of Harold's return from his trip
to the Rockies. We shall be delighted to have brother home again,
and he, no doubt, will be glad to be back among his friends. We hope
nothing will prevent your coming. Don't be late. We shall have croquet
and tennis, of course. And if the promise of the Almanac holds good,
and there should be a full moon that night, the boating will be
charming.

                                                     Yours, very truly,
                                                           LINA TAYLOR.

                                                D----, August 15, 19--.

My Dear Miss Taylor:--

Your kind note of yesterday has just come to hand. I have great
pleasure in accepting your invitation to the garden party of Thursday
evening next to welcome your pilgrim brother back to his home and
friends. I have so many pleasant memories of happy hours spent at the
Laurels, that I shall look forward to this occasion with most cheerful
anticipations. Moon or no moon, we shall be sure to have a delightful
time. You may depend on my early appearance.

                                          Believe me, dear Miss Taylor,
                                                     Yours, very truly,
                                                          ALFRED LLOYD.


=363. From a Gentleman to a Young Lady Inviting Her to Visit a Theater.=

                                                T----, October 7, 19--.

My Dear Miss Samson:--

You will doubtless have noticed by the newspapers that the venerable
Joe Jefferson, the great American comedian, is to visit D---- next week
and give a round of his inimitable performances. If you have not seen
this distinguished actor it would be a great treat to admire one of
his world-renowned characters. I should esteem it a favor if you would
accompany me any evening next week to the theater to witness one of his
wonderful presentations. Monday evening he plays in "Rip Van Winkle,"
Tuesday evening, Caleb Plummer in "The Cricket on the Hearth," and the
balance of the week he appears as Bob Acres in "The Rivals." It would
be a pleasure to me to be favored with your company any night that
would be most agreeable to you.

                                       Believe me, my dear Miss Samson,
                                                      Yours very truly,
                                                        ARCHIBALD CLAY.


=364. Answer to the Above.=

                                                T----, October 8, 19--.

Dear Mr. Clay:--

Pray accept my sincere thanks for your courteous note. I shall be
delighted to avail myself of your kind invitation for next week. I have
seen Mr. Jefferson in "Rip Van Winkle" and "The Rivals," but if it
would suit your convenience just as well I think I should like to see
him as Caleb Plummer in "The Cricket on the Hearth," which, I believe,
he plays on Tuesday evening.

With many thanks for your kind invitation,

                                                  I remain,
                                                       Yours sincerely,
                                                         MAGGIE SAMSON.

Dear Daisy:--

Next Friday is my birthday. Mamma says I may have a little tea party,
and I am to write the notes of invitation myself. I hope your mother
will let you come. We shall have tea at half-past four, and games and
dancing after tea. Trusting that you will be able to attend,

                                        I am, your affectionate friend,

Dear Alma:--

Mother says I may come to tea with you next Friday, and I shall be very
happy to. I wonder if you will have many birthday presents. Mamma is
going to send you one which I think you will like.

                                                      Your affectionate

Dear Miss Armisted:--

I thought perhaps you would like to come to town for a few days; if so
I should be very pleased if you stayed with us from next Monday on,
for a week. We will try to go to one or two concerts while you are
with us, as I know music is a great treat to you, and my husband will
perhaps take us to the theater one night. In any case, we shall go to a
Saturday matinee.

Hoping to hear that I may expect you,

                                          I remain, with love,
                                                  Affectionately yours,

Many, many thanks for your kind invitation to visit you next week. I
am only too pleased to accept it, and hope to arrive at your house on
Monday next, by the 5:30 train. I am looking forward most delightfully
to my little stay in your lovely home. With renewed thanks,

                                             Believe me,

                                                  S----, July 10, 19--.

Dear Miss Deering:--

I was just thinking, last night, whether you would not feel inclined
for a little country air; if so, perhaps you would like to run down to
us for a few days. We are only three hours and a half from town. If you
are able to come and will let me know what day to expect you, I would
tell you the best train to take, and send the pony-carriage to meet
you. I need not say that your visit will be a great pleasure to us all.

Hoping that your answer will be just "yes,"

                                                   Believe me,

Dear Mrs. Madden:--

I should have been delighted to accept your kind invitation to stay
with you for a few days, but I have arranged to go down to Newport
on Friday next, with my sister-in-law, which will, I am sorry to
say, prevent my coming to you just now. Everybody says your part of
the country is at its fairest this month, and it should have been
so pleasant to have paid you a little visit, could it have been so
arranged.

Believe me, with many heartfelt thanks,

                                                      Very truly yours,

Dear Miss Malvern:--

It is now three weeks since we arrived here, and we have enjoyed the
change from town very much; the air is so bracing. Would you care to
come down and spend a week with us? If so, it would give us much
pleasure to see you. We shall be here at least a month longer, as far
as I know at present. I can offer you a very comfortable room, and we
have a fine view of the sea from our windows. Please remember me to
your mother, and believe me,

                                                       Sincerely yours,

Dear Mrs. Read:--

How very kind of you to ask me to come and stay at your lovely place in
O---- W----! I should like nothing better than to accept your tempting
invitation; but am sorry to say at present I cannot leave home, as I
have an invalid aunt requiring all my care. She has come up to town
to consult a specialist. However, should you renew your invitation
in about ten days' time, I might safely hope to have the pleasure of
accepting it. With many thanks for thinking of me,

                                               Believe me,

My Dear Mrs. Darlington:--

I am very sorry to say we cannot have the pleasure of seeing you and
Mr. Darlington at dinner to-morrow evening, on account of the death of
my husband's sister, the sad news of which only reached us this morning.

With many regrets,

                                            Believe me,
                                                  Very sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Darwin:--

Circumstances over which I have absolutely no control oblige me to
postpone my dance from the 2d to the 10th of February. I therefore
renew my invitation for that date, and trust you will be able to accept
it.

                                              Sincerely yours,

Dear Mrs. West:--

To my deep regret, I have to ask you to postpone your visit to us for
the present; but my little girl has been very ill the last two days,
and this morning the doctor tells me that she has a slight attack of
the measles.

It is very unfortunate, as we were looking forward to your visit
with so much pleasurable anticipation. However, I trust it is only a
deferred enjoyment, and that we may see you here before long.

                                            Believe me, dear Mrs. West,
                                                  Very sincerely yours,

Dear Mrs. Hunt:--

I sincerely trust you will not pay yourself so bad a compliment as
to imagine for a moment I am neglecting you when I say that I am
prevented, to my great disappointment, from having the pleasure of
dining with you this evening. I have caught a severe cold which obliges
me to stay in-doors and take care of myself; my doctor even forbids my
going to the office for an hour, so you will understand from this how
genuine are these regrets. Am ever so sorry to be absent from such a
pleasant party.

                                                Believe me,
                                                   Very truly yours,

Dear Mrs. Wilde:--

I am very sorry to say we are prevented having the pleasure of dining
with you this evening, and must ask you to kindly accept our excuses,
late as they are. My husband was telegraphed for this morning, and
started by the 9:20 train for town, where I fear he will be detained
several days.

                                                 Believe me,
                                                      Very truly yours,

    D----,

  Dear Sir:--

On account of enforced absence from the city during the coming month, I
hereby hand in my resignation of member of the B. S. C., to take effect

PART VI

THE CORRECT FORMS OF VISITING CARDS, INVITATIONS, ETC.


VISITING CARDS

=Gentlemen's Cards.=--Plain, cream white, thin cardboard, no ornaments,
no fancy writing. Use simple engraved script, printed in black. Size of
card, 3 × 1½ inches.

  +----------------------------------------+
  |                                        |
  |  _+Mr. Edward Hale Davies,+            |
  |                                        |
  |                                        |
  |                                        |
  |               2010 Wheeler Avenue._    |
  +----------------------------------------+

Use sparingly titles or "handles" to your name, such as Hon., General,
Colonel, Dr. Army titles ought not really to be used when the bearer
has not seen real service. If he is, or has been, in the regular army,
he should have his visiting card read as follows:

  +--------------------------------------------+
  |                                            |
  | _+Col. Hugh Dalrymple, U. S. A.,+          |
  |                                            |
  |                                            |
  |                         Calumet Club._     |
  +--------------------------------------------+

A physician had better use for his "private," not "professional," card
the following form:

  +--------------------------------------------+
  |                                            |
  |  _+George D. Smith, M. D.,+                |
  |                                            |
  |                                            |
  |              1703 Michigan Boulevard._     |
  +--------------------------------------------+

It is better form still to omit lettering occupations altogether. The
abbreviation Rev. is allowable in front of a clergyman's name, even if
followed by the letters D.D.

Do not forget, if you are neither an officer, nor a clergyman, nor a
medical practitioner, to prefix your name by Mr. Should you, however,
desire to write your name on a card to "send up" to the person you are
calling on, omit the Mr.

Cards are "due"--that is, must be delivered in person--to the host
and hostess--one for each, after having enjoyed their hospitality at
some formal function, dinner, ball, musicale, etc. If prevented from
calling, a note must accompany the cards and be sent by messenger. Such
cards are also "due" after a first invitation which you have been
obliged to decline. These formal calls must be made within a week after
the event.

Cards may be sent "by mail" in acknowledgment of an invitation to a
church wedding; or, with the mention "congratulations" written by hand
to one whose engagement is announced, or who is the father of a newly
born baby. Cards of condolence, with the written words "with deepest
sympathy," may be mailed (but, better, left in person) in cases of
sorrow or bereavement.

Men rarely exchange cards, nowadays. However, a visitor in your
city may be welcomed at his hotel by the cards of acquaintances
that may have been half forgotten. Then, if he cares to renew the
erstwhile intercourse, he calls or returns the cards. After formal
"stag-parties," if a guest is not an intimate friend, it would be good
form for him to leave a card at his entertainer's club or residence.
In large cities this is done quite generally, as people there are
more formal in their social ways. It is well, at all times, for one
to remember that "courtesy in little things is a sure sign of good
breeding."

=Ladies' Cards.=--As to color, printing, etc., the rules relating to
gentlemen's visiting cards are to be followed. The size of a lady's
card is fixed just now by custom at about 3⅛ × 2¼ inches.

If the lady is the oldest married woman in the oldest branch of the
family she may omit any Christian name on her card; thus:

  +------------------------------------------+
  |                                          |
  |                                          |
  |      _+Mrs. Stewart,+                    |
  |                                          |
  |                                          |
  |                                          |
  |                      25 Astor Place_.    |
  +------------------------------------------+

In any other case her card must contain her husband's full name, thus:

  +--------------------------------------+
  |                                      |
  |                                      |
  |_+Mrs. James Gold Stewart,+           |
  |                                      |
  |                                      |
  |                                      |
  |                  25 Astor Place._    |
  +--------------------------------------+

During the first year of married life--i. e., during the period when
husband and wife, just returned from their honeymoon trip, are calling
together upon their friends and society acquaintances, they will use
the following card; the day, in the left corner, indicating when they
will be at home to their friends:

  +--------------------------------------+
  |                                      |
  |                                      |
  | _+Mr. and Mrs. James Gold Stewart,+  |
  |                                      |
  |                                      |
  |                                      |
  | _Mondays.      25 Astor Place._      |
  +--------------------------------------+

Otherwise, it is usual when the wife returns formal calls, and does so
alone, for her to leave with her own card two of her husband's, one
each for the lady and gentleman of the house she is visiting. If there
are young ladies, in the house, who are already "out"--i. e., received
in society, she will add one more of her own cards.

Young ladies are not supposed to use cards, at least until they are out
of their teens. When they are "out," their names are added on their
mother's card.

After the young lady has been "in society" at least two seasons she may
have her personal visiting cards, but without address. In that case the
elder or eldest daughter of the family uses the family name without
Christian name.

  +--------------------------------------+
  |                                      |
  |                                      |
  | _+Mrs. James Gold Stewart,+          |
  |                                      |
  |         The Misses Stewart           |
  |                                      |
  |                                      |
  |                  25 Astor Place_.    |
  +--------------------------------------+

  +--------------------------------------+
  |                                      |
  |                                      |
  |  _Miss Stewart._                     |
  |                                      |
  |                                      |
  |                                      |
  +--------------------------------------+

The younger daughters prefix their Christian name to the family name.

The day of the week when the lady is "at home" to her friends in the
afternoon is inserted in the left-hand corner of the card. Sometimes
the lady prefers to limit these receptions to certain days, then the
card reads:

  +--------------------------------------------+
  |                                            |
  |                                            |
  |_+Mrs. James Gold Stewart,+                 |
  |                                            |
  |                                            |
  |                                            |
  | First and Third                            |
  | Fridays in January,    25 Astor Place.     |
  | February and March._                       |
  +--------------------------------------------+

=Mourning Visiting Cards=, with a black border of varied breadth,
according to nearness of relationship, are very properly used, sizes
and styles being otherwise identical. However, it is in bad taste to
inscribe a reception day on a mourning card, as one is supposed to
decline all calls except from intimate friends. In fact, mourning cards
are mostly used to return thanks "by mail" to people sending condolence
cards.

=Cards of Introduction.=--Ordinary visiting cards are used for that
purpose, with the addition of some such words written at the bottom:

                 _Introducing Archibald Monroe, Esq._

Such cards must be enclosed in an envelope addressed to the person to
whom the introduction is made, but left open when delivered to the
person one wants to introduce.


INVITATION CARDS

=Cards for Social Functions.=--These are specially engraved for the
occasion, a good size being about 4 × 2½ inches; cream white Bristol
board, absolutely plain engraving. On the left-hand corner the object
of the invitation is stated: _Music_, for a musicale; _Dancing_, for a
dancing party, etc.

  +---------------------------------------+
  |                                       |
  | _+Mrs. James Gold Stewart,+           |
  |              At Home,                 |
  |  Tuesday Evening, February Second.    |
  |                                       |
  |                                       |
  | Music.            25 Astor Place._    |
  +---------------------------------------+

If the function is given in honor of some distinguished guest, the
invitation is generally worded as follows:

  +--------------------------------------+
  |                                      |
  |                                      |
  |   _+Mr. and Mrs. James Gold Stewart+ |
  |                                      |
  |       request the pleasure of        |
  |                                      |
  |   .............................'s    |
  |                                      |
  |     company on Tuesday evening,      |
  |                                      |
  |  February Second, at nine o'clock.   |
  |                                      |
  |                                      |
  |     +Lord Willoughby d'Eresby+,      |
  |                                      |
  |  British Ambassador to Washington.   |
  |                                      |
  |                                      |
  | R. S. V. P.      25 Astor Place._    |
  |                                      |
  +--------------------------------------+

The name of the guest is written with pen on the dotted line. The
letters R. S. V. P. stand for the French words, "Repondez, s'il vous
plait," meaning in English: "Answer, if you please."

Of course, a reply is to be returned at once.

Here is the most usually employed form for an invitation to dinner.
The name and date are to be filled by hand. In that way one engraved
plate is enough for all dinner parties. Another card, worded the same,
with "luncheon" inserted in place of "dinner," and the hour changed to
"half-past one," is the "correct thing" for invitations to a luncheon.

  +--------------------------------------+
  |                                      |
  |   _+Mr. and Mrs. James Gold Stewart+ |
  |                                      |
  |       request the pleasure of        |
  |                                      |
  |    ...........................'s     |
  |                                      |
  |                                      |
  | company at dinner on .............   |
  |                                      |
  | ..................at seven o'clock.  |
  |                                      |
  |                                      |
  | R. S. V. P.      25 Astor Place._    |
  |                                      |
  +--------------------------------------+

For such an important function as a "ball"--i. e., a dancing party on
a particularly elaborate scale--double sheets of thick, medium size,
cream white note, are generally used; the hour must not be earlier than
9:30, and on the lower left corner the words "Dancing at Eleven" are
to be inserted. Sometimes the hostess adds: "Fancy dress de rigueur";
meaning that all the guests are expected to appear in fancy costumes.

=Wedding Cards.=--Ought to be issued by the bride's family at least two
weeks before the wedding takes place.

If it is to be a church wedding the following invitation on a double
sheet of note paper is correct:

  +----------------------------------------+
  |                                        |
  |                                        |
  |      _+Mr. and Mrs. Edward Hall+       |
  |                                        |
  |        request your presence           |
  |                                        |
  |  at the marriage of their daughter     |
  |                                        |
  |           +Eleanor Augusta+            |
  |                                        |
  |                  to                    |
  |                                        |
  |       +Mr. George Gordon Lewis+        |
  |                                        |
  |     Saturday morning, June first       |
  |                                        |
  |          at twelve o'clock             |
  |                                        |
  |        St. Margaret Church._           |
  |                                        |
  |                                        |
  +----------------------------------------+

A more formal invitation to a wedding reception is engraved thus and
printed on a double sheet note of paper.

WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES

  The first anniversary is called the cotton wedding.
  The second, the paper wedding.
  The third, the leather wedding.
  The fifth, the wooden wedding.
  The seventh, the woolen wedding.
  The tenth, the tin wedding.
  The twelfth, the silk and fine linen wedding.
  The thirteenth, the pearl wedding.
  The fifteenth, the crystal wedding.
  The twentieth, the china wedding.
  The twenty-fifth, the silver wedding.
  The fiftieth, the golden wedding.
  The seventy-fifth, the diamond wedding.


LEAVE-TAKING

It is customary, although not quite as generally done as formerly, to
leave or mail visiting cards to all one's mere acquaintances (friends
being notified by visit or letter), when about to either change one's
habitual residence or undertake a journey of some duration. Ordinary
visiting cards are used with the letters P. P. C. written on the
left-hand corner. These are the initials of the French phrase, "Pour
prendre congé," meaning "To take leave." The custom is commendable. A
separate card ought to be sent for each grown-up member of the family.


NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS AND FUNERALS

Sometimes, to announce to acquaintances the arrival of a little
stranger, a tiny card is engraved with the baby's name and the date of
his birth, thus:

  +---------------------------------------------------+
  |                                                   |
  |               _Harold Jay Stewart,                |
  |                                                   |
  |                                                   |
  |  May first.                   25 Astor Place._    |
  |                                                   |
  +---------------------------------------------------+

Or a notification by the parents may be sent, engraved on note paper.

The proper thing, in either case, is to return cards with the word
"congratulations" written on the left-hand corner.

Invitations to funerals are engraved on heavily black-bordered note
paper, and may be worded as follows, although there are no strict rules
in the matter:

  +--------------------------------------------+
  |                                            |
  |       _You are respectfully invited        |

"Requiescat in pace"), meaning, "May he rest in peace."

2d. Said lessee agrees to surrender the possession of said premises to
said lessor upon the termination of the term above created, or upon the
forfeiture of this lease, as hereinafter provided; and further agrees,
during the occupancy of said demised premises, to maintain and keep the
same in as good condition and repair as the same shall be upon taking
possession thereof, natural wear, injury by fire, or other inevitable
accident excepted--damage by fire, or other calamity, rendering said
premises untenable, shall terminate this lease--there shall be no
abatement of said stipulated rent, or of any part thereof, so long as
said lessee shall retain possession of said demised premises, or any
part thereof.

3d. Said lessee agrees to pay the water tax upon said premises
......................... as the same becomes due and payable, and
will take reasonable and necessary precaution against freezing of the
water pipes, and that no rubbish of any description be allowed to
enter the drainage or waste pipes of said premises, and will pay all
damages or expense occasioned by such neglect; will clean the catch
basin and furnace as occasion may require, and allow no deposit of
ashes, or other rubbish, in or upon said premises, or upon any private
alley adjacent thereto; no cooking stove or other cooking apparatus

hereby leased for the purpose of examining or exhibiting the same, or
to make any needful repairs or alterations of said premises, which said

not interfere with the same.

5th. Said lessee shall not assign this lease, or any portion thereof,
nor sub-let said premises, or any part thereof, without the written
consent of the lessor, endorsed hereon. In case said demised premises
shall be vacated during said term, said lessor may take immediate
possession thereof for the remainder of the term, and, in his
discretion, re-let the same and apply the proceeds upon this lease, the
lessee to remain liable for the unpaid balance of the rent.

6th. The neglect or failure of said lessee to keep the foregoing
conditions and covenants, or any or either of them, shall constitute a
forfeiture of all rights under this lease, and the further occupancy

AN AMUSING LETTER

The following letter in "babu" English, composed by a Hindoo graduate
of Calcutta University is reproduced here _for amusement rather than
for imitation_:

    "To Babu Kaly Churan Ghose, Paternal Father of Miss Churan Ghose.
    Dear Sir:--It is with faltering penmanship that I write to have
    communication with you about the prospective condition of your
    damsel offspring. For remote time past secret passion has firing my
    bosom internally with loving for your daughter.

    I have traveled all channels in the magnitude of my extensive
    jurisdiction cruelly to smother the growing love-knot that is
    being constructed within my inside, but the timid lamp of my
    affection, trimmed by Cupid's productive hands still nourishes my
    love-sickened breast.

    Needless would it be for me to numerically extemporize the
    great conflagration that has generated in my head and heart.
    During the region of nightness my intellectual cranium has been
    entangled in thoughtful attitude for my beloved consort. Nocturnal
    slumberlessness has been the infirmity which has besieged my now
    degenerate constitution.

    My educational abilities have abandoned me, and now I cling to
    those lovely long tresses for your much coveted daughter like
    mariner shipwrecked on rock of love.

    As to my scholastic calabre, I was recently ejected from Calcutta
    University. I am now masticating and will make a motion as soon as
    I can perceive the business of life a little laxative.

    I am of lofty and original lineage and independent incomes and
    hoping that having debated proposition in your pregnant mind you
    will concordantly corroborate in espousing your female progeny to
    my tender bosom and thereby acquire me into your family circle as
    yours faithful son-in-law.

                                                 MOTI LALL CHATTERJEE."

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
