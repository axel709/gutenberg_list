PREFACE


This study in the psychology of Faith is founded on an old Scottish
folk-tale told me last year at Onich by Mr. Alexander Cameron, who, a
good many years ago, had given it also to the Rev. J. Macdougall of
Duror, in whose volume, _Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition_, now out
of print, it is included. Mr. Macdougall’s version is printed in full at
the end of this volume.

I have used the story as the framework of an allegory, and have not tried
to rival Mr. Macdougall’s narrative, nor have I often kept very close to
the text. Most of these beautiful Highland tales are in such intimate
touch with nature that they lend themselves very readily to further
development, and the story of _How Finn Kept His Children for the Big
Young Hero_ seemed to adapt itself wonderfully to my purpose.

                                                                  I. W. H.

ACT I

THE GREEN ISLE. EVENING


_This Earthly Paradise lies across the western main before you come to
the sunset. It is seen imperfectly, like a thought not fully realized,
and shimmers as if through a rainbow. It is thus described by one who has
been there:_

_“Fair is that land to all eternity beneath the snowfall of blossoms. The
gleaming walls are bright with many colours, the plains are vocal with
joyous cries, mirth and song are at home on the plain, the silver-clouded
one. No wailing there for judgment, naught but sweet song to be heard. No
pain, no grief, no death, no discord, no sin, no decay, but ever we feast
and need none to serve us, ever we love and no strife ensues. Such is the
land.”_

_In this place the Big Young Hero, the most attractive person ever
imagined, is seen vaguely as if through a radiant light. He is seated
alone on the grass watching the flowers in the midst of great beauty.
Far off across the sea the outline of the Hebrides is faintly seen,
and presently a brown-sailed fishing-boat appears on the edge of the
horizon and approaches the shore. As it nears, the figure of a girl is
discerned kneeling up in the bows, shading her eyes with her hand, and
gazing earnestly towards the shore. She carries a coil of rope over her
shoulder. As she draws near her voice is heard saying:_

                                 CLIMBER

    My anchorage was not as beautiful as I thought
      And I have weighed anchor and sailed away.
        I trust that my boat will be brought
        Into haven before the end of the day.
          I do not wish to voyage till sunset
              In this yeasty fret.
    Captain! there is no harbour that is beautiful save Thine.
      Why dost thou reserve it for the evening mariners?
        Their eyes are old and full of brine,
          They cannot see the stars.
      But mine are young, and I can count them all,
        I praise Thee, for they are full of light,
    Therefore bring me into Thy harbour before the shadows fall,
      That I may praise Thee louder—in the young night.

        [_As the boat nears the isle it comes into calm water. The
        big Young Hero goes down to meet it and helps the girl
        ashore, drawing up the boat._]

                                   HERO

    The end of all thought is peace,
    And you have found ere night the day’s increase.
    The bright and radiant day is loath to die,
    Even yet there are hardly any stars in the sky,
    Only a soft dim radiance under the moon,
    And dark trees on the brightness. Very soon
    You will be gathered in a thoughtful rest,
    And fall asleep like a bird up there in its nest.
    Are you not glad at last to realize
    Your insubstantial dream that never dies?

                                 CLIMBER

    Yes, but I’m wearied. I’ve had rather a fight
    To get here all right,
    The sea’s so deep.

                                   HERO

    Take your sleep.

        [_He sits down as before and draws her on to his knee, and
        she falls asleep at once with her head on his shoulder,
        like a tired child. He also appears to sleep. Presently the
        shadow of a man carrying a rainbow falls across his face,
        and a dream is heard singing._]

                                  DREAM

    The gates of Heaven are pearls, and stand four-square,
    And people enter in from everywhere.
    But when the heather’s on the ben
    And the wind races down the glen
    And in the wake of Highland ships
    The creaking sea-gull wheels and dips,
    And on the bogs, the hills below,
    The cotton-grass and myrtle blow—
    Bog-myrtle, with the spicy breath
    Of bitter-sweet and life and death—
    I’m glad to think that God has heard
    The meaning of the unspoken word,
    The stammering whisper of a tongue
    That learned no speech the hills among,
    The supplication of a hand
    Too fierce for men to understand,
    And that for such as me He’ll wait
    In silence by His northern gate.

        [_The shadow falls across the girl’s face, and she stirs
        and smiles in her sleep, and a dream-shadow goes from her
        also, singing. The two shadows meet, and passing into each
        other, become one._]

                               GIRL’S DREAM

    I love to think that, high in Heaven,
    Above the stars, the planets seven,
    Daybreak and darkness—if I’m there!—
    I’ll feel the wind stir in my hair,
    And Heaven’s steadfast floor will float
    Like water underneath a boat,
    And, looking down across the gold
    I’ll see the sunset, fold on fold,
    Go tumbling down the sky’s wild screes
    Beyond the Outer Hebrides.
    Then something in my heart will stir
    Like earth when spring remembers her,
    And I’ll ask, firm but quite polite,
    If God will set my compass right,
    And if He’ll aiblins help to bail
    My old boat with the tattered sail,
    And lend a hand to launch her clear
    Of Heaven, unless there’s sea like here.

        [_The blended shadow falls across the face of the Big Young
        Hero, and he looks up._]

                                  SHADOW

        [_Stirring restlessly._]

    I need something.

                                   HERO

    Who touches me?

                                  SHADOW

    The shadow of a desire.

                                   HERO

    What do you require?

                                  SHADOW

    I don’t know.

                                   HERO

    I have sent you a dream.

                                  SHADOW

    I will no longer go
    After a dream.
    I do not want to be a bore,
    But I seem
    Nowadays to need something more;
    I feel
    That I have need of something real.

        [_The girl stirs, and gives a little sigh._]

                                   HERO

    Hush! if you talk so loud you’ll waken her
    Before she’s ready.
    She needs her rest just now. She mustn’t stir;
    She’s got to steady
    Her head a bit, for she’s spent hours
    Filling her mind with things like flowers,
    Till she had sucked out of earth’s genial root
    My name like a tender shoot
    That was bound to put her in mind
    Of something unconfined.

                                  SHADOW

    Oh, do be quick!
    I’m sick
    Of standing still.

                                   HERO

    There’s no use getting ill
    About it. I am with you now;
    The very first step to Heaven’s inside your brow.
    Look there, and tell me your most dear desire,
    For it is surely something you require.

        [_The shadow shifts to that of a carpenter._]

                                CARPENTER

    I want something to do.

                                   HERO

    Who are you?

                                CARPENTER

    I am a good carpenter.

                                   HERO

    How good are you?

                                CARPENTER

    I had a sense of something due
    To someone, though I scarce kent who
    (It might have been myself or maybe you),
    And so, just at my own expense,
    I fashioned out of common sense
    A ship that’s bound to carry me
    From earth to Heaven, and as far’s I see,
    Ought to bring God again to me.

                                   HERO

    I have need of you. Show me your ship.

        [_The shadow of a large fine ship falls across the sea._]

    She is a very beautiful wide ship. Can you manage her alone?

                                CARPENTER

    I would be the better of another, to do my bidding in her.

                                   HERO

    Send me your brother.

        [_The shadow shifts to that of a tracker._]

                                   HERO

    Who are you?

                                 TRACKER

    I am a good tracker.

                                   HERO

    How good are you?

                                 TRACKER

    I do what I am told,
    I wait and look,
    Silent, ready to hold.
    It is not true
    That I am idle. I am waiting for you.
    I hook
    Strange fish upon my individual line.
    No other hand could take them, they were mine
    From all eternity, and in the eternal sea
    They would be lost for ever but for me.

                                   HERO

    You are good enough to take his telling.

                                 TRACKER

    Yes, but the clouds are swelling,
    You might maybe lend us another man forby
    To hold the tiller, in case that he and I
    Are called to the sheets together
    By a sudden change in the weather.

                                   HERO

    Send me a man off the heather.

        [_The shadow shifts to that of a gripper._]

                                   HERO

    Who are you?

                                  SHADOW

    I am a good gripper.

                                   HERO

    How good are you?

                                 GRIPPER

    You call me insistently,
    Yet when I run blithely to the place
    Where your voice deaves be, you bar the door in my face.
    What for do you treat me thus and hide?
    For still I hear you calling me from the other side.
    I am going to hold on to the sneck and wait.
    I ken there is something behind the door; early and late
    You cry on me still.
    If it be your will
    Never to open, yet is it meet
    That I come
    For under the door I can keek at the shadow of your feet
    Moving in a larger room.

                                   HERO

    You are good enough then
    To hold the tiller for these men,
    In case they are called to the sheets together
    By a sudden change in the weather.

                                 GRIPPER

    No earthly blast can overwhelm
    The ship of which I hold the helm
    If I have just a kenning more to grip,
    Something that will not give me the slip
    Like the rudder he has fashioned.
    I need something more impassioned,
    Something to which a mind can hold
    For a body’s apt to grow cold.

        [_The sleeping girl stirs and smiles._]

                                   HERO

    This is a shade sublimer.

                                 GRIPPER

    Who are you?

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Talking in her sleep._]

    I am a good climber.

                                 GRIPPER

    How good are you?

                                 CLIMBER

    I have climbed from the mind of man to the mind of God on a nervous
        stair.

                                 GRIPPER

        [_Astonished._]

    Lassie, that’s no canny! Were you no feared to fall?

                                 CLIMBER

        [_In her sleep._]

    Some day I’ll die, but how, or when, or where
    I do not greatly care,
    Because I know that with the flowers and weeds
    My life proceeds,
    If so I will, inside a gracious law.
    No flaw
    My death will be, nor mischievous accident,
    Howe’er besprent
    My blood upon the highway or the turf,
    Or in the surf
    Of thunderous combers on the ungathered sea
    But it will be
    An obvious hint of a Supreme design,
    A little clew of mine
    Left huddled by the beach or cliff to tell—
    “Pass, friend, all’s well!”

                                   HERO

    Let him hold fast
    The substance of your mind,
    So that he’ll find
    The evidence of unseen things that last,
    And that he’ll still behold
    Although his hand grows cold
    And cannot any longer feel
    The thing he thought was real.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Still in her sleep._]

      I said I climbed upon a nervous stair
                Into the mind of God,
                Yet all the way I trod
                      On air
      Because great Love upheld me there.
    I leaned and she resisted, gathering strength
                To toss me all that length
              Like some tall fountain-shower,
              And I have power
      To return again and water all the earth,
              Giving her second birth,
                Weaving her flesh,
                    Meseems,
                Out of the mesh
                    Of mind,
      After the fashion of immediate dreams,
                If I can find
                    And force
      All Love into her proper course.
    With such support it is quite true
    There’s nothing that I cannot do.

                                   HERO

    Send me something I can see through.

        [_The shadow shifts to that of a bent old woman._]

                                   HERO

    Who are you?

                                  SHADOW

    I was old and perfect at the heart
    Ere human life could start.
    Before the mind conceived of life
    I was a wife.

                                   HERO

        [_Joyfully._]

    What are you good at?

                                  SHADOW

    I am a good thief.

                                   HERO

    How good are you?

                                  THIEF

    Joy in my heart grew strong and very bright,
    Luxuriantly fed in the light of stars,
    Planets, and suns, the speed of motor-cars,
    Fire’s untamed energy, the wireless might
    Of telepathy, that burns between the bars.
    I recognized her in the lofty spars
    Of the rigging, hailing land far out of sight,
    And as she leaned and peered entranced, I crept
    Into God’s mind, the while He slept,
    And stole it bit by bit away,
    And packed it in a brain of clay;
    But unaccustomed ripples broke
    On that calm surface. He awoke,
    And I, all trembling to depart,
    Was caught a prisoner in His heart.

                                   HERO

    You are good enough,
    If that’s the stuff
    Your mind is made on.
    Help her to climb higher,
    Otherwise she’ll tire,
    For she must be stayed on
    Such substantial matter
    If she’s to get fatter.

                                  THIEF

    Yes, but I need one to hold the rope
    At the other end, to give us both more scope.
    I need something full of joy.

                                   HERO

    Send me a boy.

        [_The shadow shifts to that of a boy, and leaps lightly
        about._]

                                   HERO

    Who are you?

                                  SHADOW

        [_Sings._]

    I am something always true.
    I don’t care twopence what they think;
    I know the sky is always blue,
    And the rest of life rose-pink.

                                   HERO

        [_Affectionately._]

    Stand still! Stand still! What are you good at besides singing, eh?

                                  SHADOW

        [_Standing still suddenly._]

    I am a good listener.

                                   HERO

    How good are you?

                                 LISTENER

        [_With his hand cupped to his ear._]

    Oh, well, by now I really think I’m able
    To hear folk talking at the other end of the cable
    When I lay my ear to the ground.
    There’s certainly some sort of sound
    Like the noise I hear
    In the early part of the year,
    When underground the lilies
    Whisper: “Hark! There still is
    Life in us; don’t look so blue.
    To-morrow we’ll be getting through,
    If on your side you’ll scrape away
    As much earth as you dare to-day.”

                                   HERO

    You are strong enough to hold the rope
    At the other end, since they require more scope.

                                 LISTENER

    I know I am, quite well;
    But they think I’m just a sell.
    Can’t you show them that I’m true?
    Hullo! Why, who are you?

        [_The Big Young Hero has suddenly lifted his right hand,
        and lets fall from it the shadow of a man carrying a bow
        and arrows._]

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Placidly._]

    I am one too simple to be understood.

                                   HERO

    At what are you good?

                                 MARKSMAN

    I am a good marksman.

                                   HERO

    How good are you?

                                 MARKSMAN

    From childhood I have had a single aim.
    I did not deviate,
    I just went straight
    Ahead, till, in the place
    Where I was standing, I beheld your face,
    And found I had transfixed your name.

                                 LISTENER

        [_With delight._]

    Then I should think he’s good enough
    To show them that I’m not mere bluff.

                                   HERO

        [_Quietly._]

    He is good enough.

        [_The shadows fade, and the girl stirs restlessly in her
        sleep._]

                                 CLIMBER

    I have need of something more than dream.

                                   HERO

    I have given you something more:
    Your dream was real.

        [_The Climber laughs suddenly in her sleep, and wakens up._]

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Rubbing her eyes, and looking round with delight._]

    I feel
    Very happy, everything looks so bright.
    I knew it would clear up before to-night,
    Because I saw a rainbow very high
    Up in the sky.

                                   HERO

    I am going out fishing before the sun sets.
    Will you lend me your boat to gather
    In my nets?

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Eagerly._]

                Rather!
    Will you be long away?

                                   HERO

    I will be back with the first screich of day.
    I pray you, if it does not trouble you,
    Have breakfast ready in my house for two.

        [_They go down to the beach and launch the boat together,
        and the Big Young Hero sails slowly away in her towards the
        Hebrides, seen far off in the sunset. Soft twilight falls
        on the island, but a phosphorescence shines about the boat,
        outlining the figure of the Big Young Hero at the prow, who
        is leaning down towards the water setting the nets. Stars
        begin to come out in the sky, and on the distant shore a
        light suddenly twinkles out every few seconds on a buoy.
        The girl’s voice is heard singing as the boat drifts away._]

                              CLIMBER’S SONG

    To-night I saw a rainbow;
      It hung my way before,
    As if the hills were gate-posts
      And it was the arch of a door.
    The moor stretched all about me,
      The heather and the bee;
    I longed to trap that rainbow
      For all the world to see.

    Perhaps in distant cities,
      Perhaps down in the glen,
    The rainbow was the signal
      Of rain for other men.
    But high upon the hilltops
      The clouds blow far and free,
    And leave behind the rainbow
      Blue sky for you and me.




ACT II

A MOUNTAIN-SIDE IN ARGYLLSHIRE: MORNING


_A Scottish mountain-side covered with heather and bracken. In the
crannies of the rocks oak fern and roseroot are growing. There is a
pebbly brook running down to the sea; the sides are starred with sphagnum
moss. Grass of Parnassus, and butterwort. In its bed the yellow marsh
saxifrage is growing, and up the hillside a silver birch hangs over it.
Farther up the hill there are a rowan and an alder, and on the crest,
against the sky, a Scotch pine. Low down, by a green mound, there is a
yew-tree. In the distance the white breakers of the sea are seen, and
they are heard regularly crashing in upon the shore. There is sunshine
everywhere, and a breeze blowing the heather and chasing the shadows of
clouds across the hillside._

_At the back of the wind, behind a great rock, Finn, a middle-aged
man, is sitting, asleep. He is bowed down by a heavy pack containing a
rainbow, whose light escapes from the corners and colours it all. Some
distance off some other men are lying asleep on the heather._

_Presently the Big Young Hero’s boat is seen approaching from far out
at sea. As it nears, Finn stirs from his sleep and perceives it, and,
starting to his feet, watches it, with his hand shading his eyes. The Big
Young Hero lands from the boat, and, pulling her well up on the beach,
comes leaping over the mountain to Finn strongly and gaily. As he runs,
flowers spring up under his feet. The other men sleep on undisturbed._

                                   HERO

        [_Saluting Finn._]

        Darling of all men in the world!
    I give you the greeting in grandeur and splendour!
      I bring you glad tidings of great joy!
            I publish peace!

                                   FINN

        [_Utterly bewildered._]

    Loveliest of all heroes that I have ever seen,
    I salute you frankly, fluently, and energetically
    With the equivalent of the same words,
    Though I do not know who you are.
    Your feet are beautiful as a star.
    I wish that I could sing like the birds,
    Or blossom like the green wet earth,
    For my heart is full of mirth.
    But I can only glower and gaze
    While my mind plays,
    And sings and tumbles up and down
    Inside me, like a clown
    That makes me feel quite silly,
    Laughing willy-nilly,
    Like a man in love.
    Do you come from above,
    Or round about or below,
    Or anywhere I know?

                                   HERO

I come through night-watching and tempest of sea where I am, because I am
losing my children, and it has been told me there is not a man in all
the world who can keep them for me but you.

                                   FINN

        [_Astonished._]

    Why, how can I do that when I must bear
    This heavy rainbow with me everywhere,
    And all the years
    Have found my laughter through a mist of tears?

                                   HERO

    Since you alone were strong enough to creep
    Into my mind, and fetch me out of sleep,
    You have attained my stature, and I find
    You are a man according to my mind.

                                   FINN

        [_Crying out, afraid._]

    It was a dream, only a dream I stole!
    I never did as much
    As touch
    Your garment’s hem.

                                   HERO

    No, but you clasped my soul.
    Virtue went out of me immediately
    The moment that your love was strong enough
    To push aside the earth and find the stuff
    That dreams are made on.
    Up through the senseless clay
    You sprang like some green sappy shoot,
    And touched the nervous thoughtful root
    That I am stayed on.

                                   FINN

        [_Dumbfounded._]

    It was a dream—I never knew—

                                   HERO

          I lay upon you
      As crosses and spells
    And seven fairy fetters of travelling and straying,
      To be with me before you shall eat food,
            Or drink a draught,
          Or close an eye in sleep.

        [_At his words a delicate web of gossamer covered with
        dewdrops, spiders’ webs, and flower seeds falls over Finn.
        The Hero leaves him spellbound, and, returning gaily to
        his boat, launches her and sails away. When the boat has
        vanished the web falls away, and Finn turns round with a
        cry which arouses the other men._]

                                   FINN

    Where is he?

                                  CONAN

    Who?

                                   FINN

    The stranger that was here anon.

                                 CONDHLA

    I never knew.

                                  CONAN

    Is he gone?

                                  ANGUS

    Which way did he go?

                                   FINN

    I do not know.

                                 GONACHRY

    What was he like?

                                   FINN

    I can’t tell.
    I must find him; he has gone
    Off with something I had on.

                                  CONAN

    You don’t look very well.

                                 GONACHRY

        [_Sarcastically._]

    I saw him running up the ben,
    As swift as a spot of sunlight when
    The clouds bend with a cup
    To pounce on him and cover him up
    Like a wasp inside a glass.

                                  ANGUS

    Hush! I hear Mactalla pass,
    He’s surely singing in his sleep.
    Since it’s never very deep,
    Let us rouse him up and speir
    If the stranger is still here.

        [_All cry aloud, against the rocks: “Mactalla! Mactalla!
        Mactalla!” The echo is returned mockingly: “Mactalla!
        Mactalla! Mactalla!”_]

                                  ANGUS

    Tut! He’s in a teasing mood to-day;
    We’ll get nothing out of him. I say!
    Answer, and I’ll promise you fair,
    A big laugh to yourself off the back of Ben Y Bheithir.

                               MACTALLA[1]

        [_Mocking from somewhere._]

    I say! I say! A big laugh off the back of Ben Y Bheithir?

                                  ANGUS

    Ha! ha! You’re there, little fellow!
    Yes, at the back of Ben Bheithir, where the yellow
    Saxifrage grows out of the crannied rock,
    I’ll give you a laugh to yourself that’ll shock
    The natives, if you’ll tell us now
    Which way the stranger went.

                                 MACTALLA

    Bow-wow!
    I’ll have the big laugh out of you,
    But I cannot tell you true
    Which one way the stranger went,
    For he’s left an echo pent
    In everything he came across.
    I’m entirely at a loss.
    Can’t you catch it here and there?
    I think he must be everywhere.

        [_The growing things are heard talking._]

                                ALDER-TREE

    Is that you, Grass?

                                  GRASS

    Yes, I am growing
    Under his feet,
    If the heather will let me pass.

                                 HEATHER

    I’ll try to, if you’ll meet
    Me half-way.

                               SCOTCH PINE

        [_Loftily._]

    I say,
    There’s no knowing
    What she’ll be up to next.
    Take my text,
    And scarcely let yourself be seen,
    With anyone so very green.

                                 YEW-TREE

        [_Phlegmatically._]

    I am quite at a loss
    To know what came across
    My barrowful of withered leaves.

                                  ROWAN

        [_Gently._]

    A bairnie couped it, coming home from school,
    Among the sheaves.

                                  BIRCH

        [_Whispering._]

    Hush! hush! Softly, softly, my daughters;
    I hear the sound of mountain waters.

                                   BURN

        [_Singing._]

            Bubble! Bubble! Bubble!
            Hush! Let me down.
            Bubble! Bubble! Bubble!
            What a lot of trouble
            There is in the world
            Before you can get down
                  To bed-rock,
                And stand stock
                      Still
    As reserved, as reserved, as reserved as can be,
                Not letting slip
            A word over your lip.
    Oh! I say! Hurry! Hurry! I must get to the sea!
            Bubble! Bubble! Bubble!
            Hush! Let me down
            Without any more trouble,
            Bubble! Bubble! Bubble! Bubble!

        [_All remain listening, wrapt in wonder. Even Finn, who
        since the spell has been laid upon him has been sitting in
        great heaviness of mind, looks up and listens to the song
        with growing delight. Suddenly Angus roars with laughter._]

                                 MACTALLA

        [_Mocking._]

    Ha! Ha! Ha! Big Angus! Bow-wow!
    I said I’d have the big laugh out of you the now.

                                  ANGUS

        [_Unable to stop laughing._]

    Did ever anybody hear the like of that?

        [_The others look at him half-angrily._]

                                  CONAN

    What’s taken the fool!

                                 CONDHLA

    Pat him on the back.

                                 TORQUIL

    Can’t you hold your tongue.

                                 GONACHRY

    Did you ever hear of anyone that could!

                                  ANGUS

        [_In desperation._]

    Hold my tongue! Will that do any good?

        [_He tries to do so. It makes him laugh all the more, and
        one by one they all gradually join in his laughter except
        Finn, till they are roaring fit to split the rocks. Above
        it all Mactalla is heard mocking. At last Angus subsides,
        wiping the tears from his eyes._]

                                  CONAN

    What on earth are you laughing at?

                                  ANGUS

    Nothing on earth. What are you laughing at?

                                  CONAN

    How should I know?

                                  ANGUS

    Well, how should I know what I’m laughing at?

                                  CONAN

    Because you began, you gomeril.

                                  ANGUS

    Not I.

                                 GONACHRY

    Well, then, who did?

                                  ANGUS

    Mactalla.

                                  CONAN

    What was Mactalla laughing at?

                                  ANGUS

    That’s what I’d like to know.

                                 GONACHRY

    I never heard him.

                                  ANGUS

    That’s because you’ve no sense of humour.

                                 GONACHRY

        [_Fiercely._]

    I have a sense of humour.

                                  ANGUS

    Where is it, then?

                                 GONACHRY

    Up my sleeve.

        [_He looks up his sleeve and gives a sarcastic grin._]

                                  ANGUS

    Well, nobody can see it there
    But yourself, so you’d better take care.
    If folk don’t see what you’re laughing at
    They’ll end by laughing at you.

                                  CONAN

        [_Stooping to pick up a button._]

    What’s that?
    A button. Is it anywhere off me?

        [_He looks himself all over._]

                                 CONDHLA

    What’s it like?

                                  CONAN

    Greenish-white. No, it’s not off me
    As far as I can see.

                                  ANGUS

        [_Holding out his hand._]

    Here, it’s mine. I burst it laughing.

        [_Conan hands it over to him casually._]

                                  CONAN

        [_Lighting his pipe._]

    Come on! It’s time we were at work again.

                                 TORQUIL

    Are you taking the boat out to-day?

                                  CONAN

    Ay.

        [_Exit Conan, Condhla, and Torquil._]

                                  ANGUS

        [_To Finn._]

    Aren’t you coming?

                                   FINN

        [_Abstractedly._]

    Not to-day, not to-day.

                                 GONACHRY

        [_Laughing carelessly._]

    He looks to me as if he had gone daft.

        [_He slouches off after the others with his hands in his
        pockets._]

                                  ANGUS

    It’s very queer the way he never laughed.

        [_He goes up to Finn and gives him a hearty slap on the
        back._]

    Come, man! What ails you?

                                   FINN

        [_Throwing him off with sudden irritation._]

    Get away, you gomeril!

                                  ANGUS

        [_Aside._]

    He’s fey!

        [_He makes a sign to keep off the evil eye, and retreats
        hurriedly after the others, casting suspicious glances
        backwards at Finn._]

                                   FINN

        [_Seeing himself alone, with a sigh of relief hoists his
        rainbow resolutely and tightens his belt._]

    I will prick on my way
    Far into the country of my God,
    And if it be true, as they say,
    That He is calm and unhurried,
    Some day I shall break through a gap in the hedge
    And come upon Him seated by the road-edge.
    Then shall I say to Him these three things, baring my brow:
    “Wherefore art Thou, whence didst Thou come, and whither goest Thou?
    Answer, I pray, for I ask of Thee
    As one traveller of another.”

        [_Enter the Carpenter, unperceived by Finn._]

                                CARPENTER

    Good day!

                                   FINN

        [_Starting violently._]

    Good day!

                                CARPENTER

    It’s a fine day.

                                   FINN

        [_Gloomily._]

    It’s fine as long as this breeze lasts, but I’m thinking
    it’ll not be long before there’s a shower coming over
    from Badenoch.

                                CARPENTER

    Ay! It’s soft; but it’ll not be much with the sun
    where it is.

                                   FINN

    The sun may be as high as it likes, it’ll not make
    much difference to the shadow on my mind.

                                CARPENTER

    What sort of a shadow is on your mind?

                                   FINN

    A shadow like the one across the breast
    Of Kinlochleven when the sun goes west,
    And the Bidean, that great serious Ben,
    Stoops to consider men.

                                CARPENTER

    That’s a long shadow.

                                   FINN

It’s a shadow of crosses and spells and seven fairy fetters of travelling
and straying, to be with the one that considers me before I shall eat
food, or drink a draught, or close an eye in sleep.

                                CARPENTER

It’s a long shadow, but maybe I can help you to the one that considers
you if you’ll consider me.

                                   FINN

What are you good at to help me?

                                CARPENTER

I am a good carpenter.

                                   FINN

How good are you at carpentry?

                                CARPENTER

With three strokes of this axe I can make a large capacious complete ship
of the alder-stock over yonder.

                                   FINN

        [_Eagerly._]

    You are good enough then, carpenter, for I am wanting a ship
    To go on this trip.
    Can you prove me your skill?

                                CARPENTER

    Ay, with a will.

        [_The Carpenter goes to the alder-stock, strikes it with
        his axe thrice, and, as he says, the ship is ready in the
        sea waiting for them._]

                                   FINN

        [_Delighted._]

    It is a very beautiful wide ship; what can it do?

                                CARPENTER

    It can take you to the one that considers you,
    If rightly handled, and, as far’s I see,
    Brings such a one again to you and me.

                                   FINN

        [_Eagerly._]

    Will you lend her to me?

                                CARPENTER

        [_Pawkily._]

    Ay, if you are willing to engage
    My brother too for a trifling wage.
    I’ll not can manage her alone.

                                   FINN

        [_Impatiently._]

    Come on! Come on! Call me your brother;
    He’ll do as well as any other.

        [_The Carpenter whistles shrilly on his fingers, and the
        Tracker enters._]

                                CARPENTER

    You’re wanted for the boat the now;
    He needs you at the bow.

                                 TRACKER

        [_To Finn._]

    What is your will?

                                   FINN

    What are you good at?

                                 TRACKER

    I am a good tracker.

                                   FINN

    How good are you at tracking?

                                 TRACKER

I can track the wild duck over the crests of the nine waves within nine
days.

                                   FINN

    Then you are good enough to track
    The one that considers me, and bring him back.

                                 TRACKER

    That will I blindfold;
    But I need another to hold
    The tiller, in case we’re called to the sheets together.
    Call me that man there, coming across the heather.

        [_The Gripper is seen approaching over the hillside._]

                                 GRIPPER

    Good day!

                                   FINN

    Good day! What are you good at?

                                 GRIPPER

    I am a good gripper.

                                   FINN

    How good are you?

                                 GRIPPER

The hold I once get I will not let go until my two arms come from my
shoulder, or until my hold comes with me.

                                   FINN

    Then you are good enough to hold until
    The one that considers me comes with your hold?

                                 GRIPPER

    That will I, sitting still;
    But as my hand’s apt to grow cold,
    I’ll need that lassie there to keep my mind
    Off thinking of it.

        [_The Climber has suddenly swung herself down by a golden
        rope at Finn’s side._]

                                   FINN

        [_Astonished._]

    Why, how did you find
    Your way down here?

        [_He takes off his cap politely._]

                                 CLIMBER

    I climbed down.

                                   FINN

        [_Aside._]

    I don’t see any stair.
    I wonder if she’s quite all there!

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Answering his thought._]

    No, just at present I am mostly here.

                                   FINN

        [_Aside._]

    Her answer isn’t very clear.

        [_Aloud._]

    And what are you good at?

                                 CLIMBER

    I am a good climber.

                                   FINN

    I see that.
    How good are you at climbing?

                                 CLIMBER

I could climb on a filament of silk to the stars if you were to tie it
there.

                                   FINN

        [_Looking at her dreamily._]

    Will you be good enough then, please, to stare
    Into each star and tell me if He’s there.

        [_He collects himself, and adds hastily._]

    The one that considers me, I mean.

                                 CLIMBER

    I’ll be your go-between
    With pleasure, but I’m young to come alone;
    Call me that woman there as a chaperon.

        [_The Thief and the Listener have entered hand in hand.
        Finn beckons to the Thief, taking off his cap again
        politely._]

                                   FINN

    What are you good at, dame?

                                  THIEF

    I am a good thief.

                                   FINN

    How good are you at thieving?

                                  THIEF

I can steal the egg from the heron while her two eyes are looking at me.

                                   FINN

    Then if you’ll come with me and steal
    The one that considers me, I’ll feel
    Greatly obliged to you, there is no doubt.

                                  THIEF

    I’ll take you by a pretty roundabout
    If you are also able to employ
    My boy.

                                   FINN

    What is he good at?

                                 LISTENER

    I am a good listener.

                                   FINN

    How good are you at listening?

                                 LISTENER

I can hear what the people are saying at the extremity of the uttermost
world.

                                   FINN

    You are good enough, then. Maybe you can hear
    Whether the one that considers me is near?

                                 LISTENER

        [_Putting his hand to his ear._]

    You’re very hot!

        [_Finn, who has been standing beside the Climber, moves
        forward hastily._]

    No, now you’re colder!
    I’ll find Him ere I am much older,
    Only some people are so narrow,
    I’ll need that man with the bow and arrow

        [_Enter Marksman._]

    To bear me out ere they’ll agree
    That seeing’s believing what I see.

                                   FINN

        [_To Marksman._]

    What are you good at?

                                 MARKSMAN

    I am a good marksman.

                                   FINN

    How good are you?

                                 MARKSMAN

I could hit an egg as far off in the sky as bowstring could send or bow
could carry.

                                   FINN

    If you can hit the place where He
    Is hidden who considers me,
    We need no longer tarry.
    For I am drawn by an insatiable desire,
    I am consumed in an impetuous fire,
    And I am denied all rest
    Until my quest
    Is ended. Would that I could find
    A lodge for my soul, where I might leave behind
    All longing for ever, slumbering complete
    At His feet.
    Would I could rest in that bright place where I
    In spirit lie.
    Its light has cast a shadow on the brow
    Of this fair “Now.”
    Why did He make that garden-place so fair?
    My soul, a bird, is there,
    With limed wings fast to that apple-bough.

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Putting his hand kindly on his shoulder._]

    Come, then, and let’s be gone.
    Your fellows will come after you anon.

        [_They launch the ship, and the Gripper takes the helm.
        The Tracker, who is at the bow, is seen telling him now
        to go this way and now to go that way, and the ship obeys
        his hand beautifully. The waves begin to rise as the ship
        gets farther from sight, but the Tracker still finds a
        smooth path through the waters. The Listener leans over
        the side, and sings a song as the boat slips out to sea.
        It is a wild and beautiful song, haunting, sweet, and
        long-drawn-out._]

                             LISTENER’S SONG

    I made a little song, and it was true,
    Though nobody heeded it in the press of things;
    I left it alone a thousand years, and it grew,
    And I heard it again one day in the mouth of kings.

    All as I went I joyed me a mighty joy.
    They laughed at me; they said: “You’re still very young”;
    But I knew better than that when I was a boy,
    And when I was old I found the song I’d sung.

ACT III. SCENE 1

A BEAUTIFUL HIGHLAND SHORE: AFTERNOON


_In the distance up the glen there is seen smoke evidently rising
from a house hidden somewhere in the trees. In the foreground there
are heather and rocks and a beautiful alder-tree with thick foliage.
Curlews and sea-gulls are crying, and a breeze is tossing the waves into
white horses. At this moment Finn enters, looking rather wretched and
storm-tossed. He sits down on a boulder, with a weary sigh._

                                   FINN

        [_Yawning._]

    Heigh-ho!—Hay-hum-harry!
    This box is a weary weight to carry.

                             CLIMBER’S VOICE

        [_Calling from the alder-tree._]

    I wish you’d let me take a share!

                                   FINN

        [_Starting violently, and looking up._]

    Certainly not! What are you doing up there?

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Pushing her head out through the leaves._]

    I went up after a squirrel.

                                   FINN

    At your age that’s not proper for a girl.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Singing._]

    Oh, to-day I’m twenty-seven!
    What delight to rhyme with Heaven!
    I’m as happy as can be,
    Here inside the alder-tree.

    All my life’s a song that flows
    With the river and the rose,
    All my life’s a song to me
    Like the lovely alder-tree.

    All the years I’ve left behind
    Are translated in my mind
    Into something new and free,
    Like the seed-pod on the tree.

    All that’s past is unforgotten;
    I have wrapped it up in cotton,
    Like the larva that I see
    In the leaf upon the tree.

    It will grow and change and gather
    Knowledge of a mind, its Father;
    Some morning in its glee
    It will float above the tree.

    Oh, to-day I’m twenty-seven!
    Just a little nearer Heaven
    Than I ever used to be
    When I climbed the alder-tree.

    For I feel at last that I,
    Like the larva, change and fly
    Yet a grander, fuller me,
    On the self-same alder-tree.

                                   FINN

        [_Who has listened with delight to the song._]

    You’re a very eccentric sort of girl.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Coming down hastily._]

    No! Eccentricity I hate!
    It’s just a name for off the straight;
    And, if you’ll only pay me more attention,
    You’ll find it’s almost too far off to mention.

        [_Finn looks at her doubtfully._]

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Coaxingly._]

    I wish you’d let me take a share
    Of that old box you’re carrying there.

                                   FINN

        [_Hastily._]

    I wouldn’t dream of such a thing!

                                 CLIMBER

    Take care! It needs a stronger piece of string.
    And if you drop it, that would be a pity;
    It looks as if the contents were so pretty.
    What is inside it? May I know?

                                   FINN

    Guess!

                                 CLIMBER

    I can’t. It seems to show
    All bright about the edge.

        [_She tries the weight._]

                                I can’t see quite
    What makes it heavy when it looks so light?

                                   FINN

    Tears of all sorts, and colours to suit each eye.

                                 CLIMBER

    Then why
    Is it so light when it feels such a weight?

                                   FINN

    Oh! that’s just Fate.
    A glint of laughter
    Getting through each tear
    A little after.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Clapping her hands._]

    Oh dear!
    How beautiful! I’ve guessed it—a rainbow!
    You’ve got a rainbow there,
    I knew last night the morning would be fair!

                                   FINN

        [_Astonished._]

    How did you guess?

                                 CLIMBER

    I saw the rain-clouds yesterday
    Coming up Crianlarich way,
    Black as peat and full of dark.
    Suddenly God set His mark
    Over them all in a rainbow,
              And so
              I knew
    The sun was somewhere getting through,
    And, turning, saw him come
    Hurriedly over the hills above Tyndrum.

        [_She turns and sees Finn looking at her with a wistful
        expression._]

    What are you thinking about?

                                   FINN

    Nothing at all. A dream.

                                 CLIMBER

    Look out! They are not what they seem!

                                   FINN

    They’re harmless enough. They aren’t real.

                                 CLIMBER

    They’re made of stuff
    That’s very apt to steal
        Intact
    Into actual fact.
    For instance, look at these.

        [_She points to some mountain pansies in the grass._]

                                   FINN

    Explain the connection, please.

                                 CLIMBER

    Don’t you see it, sumph?

                                   FINN

    Umph!
    They seem to give you a lot of pleasure.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Sniffing delightedly._]

    Yes, without measure.
    Don’t they give it you?

                                   FINN

    Oh! Well enough.
    Though, as a rule, I think
    That I prefer a more substantial stuff,
    Something to eat or drink,
    Yet somehow now I feel dead beat;
    I couldn’t stand the sight of meat.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Rapturously._]

    Oh, I could feed
    On flowers for ever!

                                   FINN

    Well, then, you must be very clever.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Hastily._]

    Oh no! there is no need.
    It happened through a violet’s power,
    For that’s my favourite flower.

        [_Shyly, in a burst of sudden confidence._]

    I’ll tell you how it came about
    If you’d care to find out.

                                   FINN

        [_Settling himself on the bank._]

    All right, I don’t mind if you do;
    But it won’t be the same for me as you.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Sitting up and clasping her hands round her knees shyly._]

    I was attracted by a violet,
    For purple’s my favourite colour, and you get
    Such a delightful perfume out of these
    When the wind makes a breeze
        Among the petals.
    God said: “That settles
    It. Now she’ll come back here
        Another year,
    And look for me where she has found her pleasure.”
        I did not measure
    God’s far arrangement thus; but sure enough
    (Since purple’s my favourite colour), when the puff
    Of spring cast up her wild young flowery wrack,
    I looked to see if the violet were blown back.

        [_She begins to lose her self-consciousness. Finn watches
        her interestedly._]

        Sufficient she was there!
        I pushed my hair
    Back from my brow, and on my knees I went
        To catch her scent.
        Oh, it was joy
      I thought would never cloy!
    And God, who saw me on the grass beside
        That purple pride,
    Laughed softly to Himself, and said: “I knew
        She’d not resist My blue.
    Now I’ll be bound she’ll come again next year
        To find my fragrance here.”

        [_She continues with increasing animation, having quite
        lost all self-consciousness._]

    In very deed I came,
    But now a flame
    Of ultra-violet flickered on my thought.
    It wasn’t just the scent that brought
    Me back like that, nor yet the lovely blue;
    It was because I felt that God was true.
    And that was how, having had my attention called
    To something that came back and never palled,
    But seemed each year more lovely than the last,
        I passed
    To looking for the far-off deeper things
    That God had tucked behind the violet’s wings.
    I said to myself: “This is some sort of sign
    Of constancy divine,
    And I expect there must be some such mark
    Set on our ultimate dark;
    For we are all just one material here—
    My heart, the violet clear.

        [_Dreamily, to herself._]

    Oh! Isn’t it delightful thus to grow
    Together yet apart a little while?
    God needs this time to shape us to the style
    Of His eternity, as, strong and slow,
    The separate shadows of the flowery prime
    Become one purple deep at evening-time.

        [_She takes a violet in her hands and looks at it. To
        herself._]

    Here’s all the evidence of things unseen,
    Delicious substance of a life to be,
    Where maybe I’ll share His identity,
    And we’ll be One to all eternity.

                                   FINN

    What?

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Who has forgotten that she is not alone, blushing
        self-consciously and starting violently._]

    Nothing! It’s not
    Meant for you to hear.

                                   FINN

    Go on about next year.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Very shyly, with averted face._]

    Well, in the spring I came, with joyous thirst,
    To find the violet where I found her first;
    Till, kneeling there one day, I felt my heart
    Quicken and start,
    And pushing back the lid, to look within,
        I saw a thin
    Long tongue of lavender amid the red,
    And God knelt there, and spread
    His strong white hands above the warm, bright stain,
    And laughed, and said: “I have found faith again
        On earth.”

        [_She pauses, and adds in a whisper._]

    But I, too much amazed for mirth,
    Could only gaze and stammer: “Sir, not yet,
        It was Your violet.”

        [_There is silence. The Climber remains with shy averted
        face._]

                                   FINN

        [_After an embarrassed pause._]

    I don’t see how a violet’s shown
    You that. Tell me it all again.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Jumping up, with a nervous laugh._]

    Oh dear! I wish I could explain
    Better. But it’s the sort of thing
    You’ll have to find alone. I’m off to bring
    The others. I’ll be back in a minute.

        [_She runs away, with a very red face. Finn yawns, sighs,
        and, picking a violet, sniffs and sniffs again._]

                                   FINN

    Delicious! I believe there’s something in it!

        [_He puts the violet in his buttonhole._]

    Even if it isn’t much
    It’s something I could almost touch
    A morsel of just now.

        [_Enter the Listener, whistling, and chipping himself a
        whistle out of an alder branch._]

                                   FINN

    Hallo! Where are the others?

                                 LISTENER

    Patching up the boat a bit in smothers
    Of spray. The wind seems blowing this way.

        [_He waves his hand in the direction in which the Climber
        has gone._]

    Still feeling sick?

                                   FINN

    Certainly not. I wasn’t sick!

                                 LISTENER

    Oh! I thought that was why
    You wouldn’t come down to tea,
    When you said you wished we’d let you die.

                                   FINN

        [_Hastily._]

    Certainly not!

                                 LISTENER

    Then why——

                                   FINN

        [_Hurriedly._]

    There’s a sort of spell on me.
    I can’t consider common stuff like tea
    Until I have found the one that considers me.

                                 LISTENER

        [_Sympathetically._]

    I say! How beastly! Worse than being in love.

                                   FINN

        [_Indignantly._]

    Not at all! It’s not the least the same.

                                 LISTENER

        [_Innocently._]

    Why? What’s the difference?

                                   FINN

        [_Crossly._]

    Oh, go away! How should I know?

                                 LISTENER

    Would you like to hear what I heard up above
            The tree-tops, before I came
                Out of the wood?

                                   FINN

        [_Crossly._]

    Not unless it’s easily understood.

                                 LISTENER

        [_Cheerily._]

    Oh yes!
    It’s the sort of thing that any child could guess.

        [_He begins to pipe a very cheery little tune, and then
        stops and looks at Finn enquiringly._]

                                   FINN

        [_Brightening._]

    That’s not bad. Go on!

                                 LISTENER

        [_Beginning to sing._]

    Tiravee! Tiravee! Tiravee!
    The year has heard the spring
    In far recesses smouldering.
    Tiravee! Tiravee! Tiravee!
        The robins sing,
    Daffadowndillies and lilies
    And crocuses are hiding,
    Under the garden abiding,
    Soon you’ll see! Soon you’ll see!
        Soon you’ll see!
    For along the west border,
    All in their proper order,
        Just like last year—
    Look!—the tops of the snowdrops are here!
        Tiravee! Tiravee! Tiravee!
    Oh, how wonderful it is to see
    The spring again just as she used to be!
        Showing how the bulbs grow
            Under the ground,
        Making a sound
        Where silence lay low.
            Displaying
        The beauty of the earth,
            Saying:
        “There is no death.
        For consider the lilies
    How they grow, and the daffadowndillies,
            Underground
        They have found
            The spring!”
        Oh, Robin, sing!
        Oh, come away and see
            The tops
        Of the first snowdrops!
        Tiravee! Tiravee! Tiravee!

        [_During the song the others, drawn by the sound of piping,
        all begin to come in one by one, with the exception of the
        Climber, beginning with the Marksman and ending with the
        Carpenter, dancing and humming the tune. When the Listener
        has done they all applaud him delightedly, and the Marksman
        lets fly an arrow seaward._]

                                 LISTENER

        [_Astonished._]

    What’s that for?

                                 MARKSMAN

    You hit the mark that time.

                                 LISTENER

        [_Running to look._]

    Where? I didn’t see!

                                 MARKSMAN

    Nobody did but me.
    Who taught you that song sublime?

                                 LISTENER

    A robin back there in the wood;
    I haven’t got it very good.

                                   FINN

    You have a very fine ear.
    Is there anything else you can hear?

                                 LISTENER

        [_Putting his ear to the ground and listening intently._]

    I can hear the voice of your mother.

                                   FINN

        [_Eagerly._]

    What is she saying?

                                 LISTENER

    She’s saying she’s unravelling
    Your fetters of travelling
        And straying;
        She’s saying
    She’s sending your father
    To help you to gather
    The children he’s losing
    Through none of her choosing.

                                   FINN

        [_Bewildered._]

    Talk sense!

                                 LISTENER

        [_Offended._]

    I do; but it’s too immense
    For you to comprehend
    With your unenlightened end!

        [_Aside._]

    There! didn’t I tell you she’d send!

        [_At this moment the Climber runs in excitedly._]

                                 CLIMBER

    I’ve just met a woman in the wood
    Who says she’s losing
    Her children through none of her choosing,
    And that you are the only man
    Who can
    Help her, if you’ll be so very good.

                                   FINN

        [_Amazed._]

    That’s what the Big Young Hero said to me
    This morning, brought him through the strife
    Of night-watching and tempest of sea!
    I wonder who this woman can be?

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Excitedly._]

    I believe she is his wife?

                                   FINN

    How is she losing the children?

                                 CLIMBER

    She says she’s losing them in the night
    That claps down on men,
    For a Hand comes in at the window ere it’s light,
    And takes them all away ben.

                                   FINN

        [_After a pause._]

    I can’t help that!

                                 CLIMBER

    Yes, she says you can,
    If you were half a man.

                                   FINN

    Why, what must I be at?

                                 CLIMBER

    She says you must watch through the night
    Within her house, until you see daylight.

                                   FINN

        [_Sighing wearily._]

    I want my supper now. I really couldn’t keep
    My eyes open; I’m sure I’d go to sleep.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Very earnestly and impressively._]

    Although she has laid supper in her house,
    Please do not touch it yet, or you’ll arouse
    The Hand
    Before you understand
    How you must use the body to discern
    The proper system of the mind, and learn
    You were not built like the bewildered moon,
    To dwindle ere you’ve found another face,
    Revolving inwards like an old buffoon,
    Too much attracted by an earthly grace;
    But, on a nervous pivot justly hung,
    Bringing your mind to bear upon the clay,
    Can turn your sleepy body round among
    The starry systems of another day;
    For that is how I think we’re meant to gather
    Her earthly treasure for a Heavenly Father,
    Till He recall us from her dewy field
    At evening-time, building a finer bield
    For souls returning mindful of earth’s beauty,
    Not naked as they came.

                                   FINN

                            I’ll do my duty
    If you’ll show me the way
    To the place where I’m to stay.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Delighted._]

    All right!
    We must look sharp as long as there’s this light.

        [_She beckons the others to follow._]

                                   FINN

        [_Pausing suddenly._]

    Why, what was that that fell?
    I believe it was the spell.

        [_He looks about._]

    I feel hungry enough for two
    All of a sudden. Aren’t you?

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Warningly._]

    No, I had something to eat before I came,
    And in the morning you will get the same
    If only now you’ll try not to eat double;
    For if you do we’ll all get into trouble.

        [_Exit all after the Climber._]




ACT III. SCENE 2

THE HOUSE OF THE EARTH-MOTHER: GLOAMING


_The kitchen of the Earth-Mother’s house. A big open fire in the middle
of the room, with a hole in the thatch above it to let the smoke out. A
child asleep in a cradle beside it. The remains of a lavish supper on a
table in the corner. The men are all lying about the fire asleep. Finn
alone is sitting in a low chair drowsing. The Climber is lying asleep on
a settle in the corner, near the Thief, who is sitting quietly watchful
by the child. She alone seems wide awake._

                                   FINN

        [_Nodding drowsily, starts and falls forward. Shaking
        himself up, he looks round, rubbing his eyes and yawning._]

    Heigh-ho!—Heigh-hum-harry!
    This rainbow is a weary job to carry.

        [_Looks round._]

    No one seems awake that I can see.

                                  THIEF

        [_Quietly._]

    You forget me.

                                   FINN

        [_Startled._]

    Oh! Are you awake?

                                  THIEF

        [_Quietly._]

    I’m always awake.

                                   FINN

    Then I can take
        A nap.

                                  THIEF

        [_Calmly._]

    For Heaven’s sake
        Keep awake,
    Or the child will be taken away in the cap
        Of the Hand.

                                   FINN

        [_Drowsily._]

    Bother! I don’t understand.

        [_Pointing to the Climber._]

    Even she’s sleeping.

                                  THIEF

    Yes, she has been weeping.

                                   FINN

        [_Uneasy._]

    Why, whatever’s the matter?

                                  THIEF

    Everything.
    You’ve eaten too much.

                                   FINN

        [_Defensively._]

    Why, I didn’t touch
    More than I ought,
        Did I?

                                  THIEF

    You took a thought
    More than she did, that’s why
    You have upset her.

                                   FINN

        [_Sulkily._]

    I wish to goodness I had never met her,
    If she’s so very easily upset.

                                  THIEF

        [_Quietly._]

    I fear she’s very childish for her age.
    It’s apt to overbalance her at this stage;
    She isn’t up to all God’s ropes as yet.

                                   FINN

        [_Crossly._]

    I thought she said
    That she could climb upon a thread
        Up to a star
    Were I to tie it there.

                                  THIEF

    Ay! But it needs more care
    To return so far
    Trundling the star.

        [_Finn sits silent for a little while, and begins to nod
        again. At last he rouses himself with a start._]

                                   FINN

    I’m much too plastic;
    This needs something drastic.

        [_He snatches a brand of wood from the fire, and thrusts
        it through the bone of his palm. The Climber immediately
        starts up in her sleep with a cry of pain._]

        [_Startled._]

    What’s wrong? Why——?

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Talking in her sleep, in great distress._]

    You are in pain!

                                   FINN

        [_Defiantly._]

    Not I!

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Half asleep._]

    You’re hurting yourself with trying to keep awake!

                                   FINN

        [_Coldly._]

    You’re making a mistake.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Bewildered and dreamy._]

    Oh, I’m sorry! I thought you called me.

                                   FINN

        [_Stoically._]

    No.

        [_The Marksman turns in his sleep with a groan._]

                                 CLIMBER

    I beg your pardon.

                                  THIEF

        [_Quietly._]

    Lie down. If he’s in pain
    I’ll call you again.

        [_The Climber lies down again._]

                               THIEF SINGS:

    I have a lover in my mind,
    And there I stray.
    He whispers dreams to me all night;
    I dream with him all day.

    We tell each other foreign things,
    We dream strange dreams, we two;
    Sometimes he whispers He is God,
    And I dream I am too.

        [_Finn, nodding, repeats former process. Again the Climber
        starts up in her sleep with a loud cry of anguish._]

                                 CLIMBER

        [_As before, talking half in her sleep._]

    You are in pain?

                                   FINN

        [_Wiping his brow._]

    Not I, you’re dreaming.

        [_The Marksman again groans in his sleep._]

                                  THIEF

        [_Quietly._]

    Lie down. If he’s in pain
    I’ll call you again.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Bewildered and troubled, still asleep._]

    I’m very sorry, indeed I meant no harm;
    I feel as if I were under some sort of charm.

        [_She lies down again._]

                               THIEF SINGS:

    Love seeketh not a Heaven’s delight.
    If her beloved inhabit there,
    She is content with outer night,
    And finds in Hell no deep despair.

    Yet if the love of God divine
    Feel lonely Heaven a grave mistake,
    And say: “Is Hell not also mine?”
    Love answers: “Yea, Lord, take.”

        [_By this time Finn has fallen quite asleep. The fire
        dies low. Suddenly a strange light begins to play about
        the Climber. She starts up half-awake, and looks round
        bewildered. Then she speaks to the Thief in an awed
        whisper._]

                                 CLIMBER

    Who called me? Was it you?

                                  THIEF

    I have been sitting quietly by the cradle all this time.

                                 CLIMBER

    Inside my brain
    There’s something tugging me, a sort of strain,
    A terrible wistfulness, my mind’s all bruised.
    Something calls me that is not amused.
          Is it God?
          Or is it not God?

                                  THIEF

        [_Gravely._]

    It is God.
    Lie down. He will call you again
    If He is in pain.

        [_The Climber lies down again. The fire dies quite low, but
        the radiance about her grows bright and brighter; she alone
        is left visible. Suddenly, for a moment, as through a veil,
        the face of the Big Young Hero is seen looking wistfully
        down on her. She starts up with her hands clasped to her
        breast, and speaks in an awed whisper._]

                                 CLIMBER

    Did you call me, sir?

                                   HERO

    I sent Finn to call you.

                                 CLIMBER

    I heard him. Do you require us both?

                                   HERO

    Yes, urgently; make haste.

        [_The vision fades, leaving the Climber alone in the midst
        of a great brightness._]

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Whispering._]

    Always I have known Thou wert there,
    But to-night Thou hast revealed Thyself utterly and
    Thy face is bare.
    I cannot tell how beautiful Thou art.
    All of my heart
    Is radiant with the fierce surprise
    Of Thine eyes,
    All of my soul
    Stands shuddering at her goal.

    Long ago she knew Thee, yet she feared
    To name Thee, ever she peered
    Into the darkness, whispering: “Not mine,”
    To-night she doth divine
    Wholly, and she is very bold, and boasts, and hath good cheer,
    Entertaining the love that casts out fear.

        [_The brightness fades, leaving darkness for a moment, then
        the fire leaps up again, illuminating the room. The Climber
        looks about her, bewildered with ecstasy._]

    Oh, I have had such a wonderful dream!
    Why, they all seem
    To be asleep!

                                  THIEF

        [_Quietly._]

    I am not asleep.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Radiant._]

    Oh, did you see my dream?

                                  THIEF

    Yes; I stole it for you.

                                 CLIMBER

    Where did you get it?

                                  THIEF

    Out of the mind of God.

                                 CLIMBER

    It was most beautiful; can’t you find
    Another the same?

                                  THIEF

    Yes, from where that one came;
    But it is not for you.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Disappointed._]

    Oh! Who’s it for?

                                  THIEF

    Never mind,
    You’ll find
    When you make yours come true.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Very eagerly._]

    Why, what must I do?

                                  THIEF

    You must make them believe it.
    You must take it and weave it,
    By a kind of story,
    Into actual glory.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Jumping up joyfully._]

    Where shall I begin?

                                  THIEF

    With Finn.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Drawing back nervously._]

    Oh no, I can’t! He’ll think it very queer.
    I—I haven’t got the courage to reveal
    A dream so very delicate and real.
    They’ll laugh at me. They’ll all think I am queer.

                                  THIEF

        [_Indifferently._]

    I have nothing to do with fear.
    Your business is to do just as I tell.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Summoning up all her resolution._]

    Very well.

                                  THIEF

        [_Quietly._]

    If you’re to carry out God’s plan
    You must pitch into every man.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Trembling with nervousness._]

    All right! To make my dream come true
    There’s nothing I’m afraid to do.

        [_She runs quickly over to Finn and takes him eagerly by
        the hand to wake him. He starts awake with a quiver of
        pain, withdrawing his hand._]

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Overstrained and very nervous._]

    Oh, are you angry at me?

                                   FINN

        [_Gently._]

    Why should I be angry?

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Shyly._]

    For—for waking you up.

                                   FINN

    Was I asleep?

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Nervously._]

    Yes; but I’ve brought you something that’ll keep
    You awake for ever.

        [_She laughs nervously._]

                                   FINN

        [_Politely._]

    Never!
    What is it?

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Shyly._]

    N—nothing; just a dream.

                                   FINN

        [_Embarrassed._]

    Better keep it to yourself.
    Dreams are things some folk don’t understand.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_In distress, catching sight of his hand._]

    Why, what have you done to your hand?
    You’ve burnt it all!
    You were in pain, I knew!
    I heard you call.
    Why did you say it wasn’t true?

                                   FINN

        [_Withdrawing his hand hastily._]

    It’s nothing to do with you.
    Go to sleep again;
    I never felt the slightest pain.

        [_The Marksman groans in his sleep._]

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Embarrassed and shy._]

    Don’t you, really?

                                   FINN

        [_Resolutely._]

    No. I tell you it’s quite numb.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Grieved and awkward._]

    Then you didn’t call me to come?

                                   FINN

        [_Turning his head away with a groan._]

    No. I am in no need.

        [_The Marksman groans in his sleep again. Finn turns and
        looks more attentively at the Climber, hesitating. She is
        pale and overstrained looking._]

        [_Kindly._]

    I really think you ought to feed
    Yourself up a bit.
    You’re not looking very fit.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Hurriedly._]

    I was asleep. I’m quite all right.
    It’s just a silly dream. Good night.

        [_Marksman groans._]

    Be sure you keep awake.

        [_She retreats nervously._]

                                   FINN

    Good night. Be sure you keep
        Asleep.
    Don’t worry about me for any sake;
    I’m wide enough awake.

        [_The Marksman groans again, and Finn begins to nod heavily
        even as he speaks._]

                                 CLIMBER

        [_To the thief, bursting into tears._]

    They won’t believe my dream.
    You’ve made me feel an awful fool.
    He’s laughing now. I know I seem
    Quite childish!

                                  THIEF

        [_Aside._]

                    To keep cool,
    The best way is by letting off some steam.

        [_To the Climber, very sternly._]

    The fault was yours. You have betrayed your dream.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Weeps silently for a little, then wipes her eyes and
        speaks as if to herself._]

    They tell me that I have my birth
    Some other where,
    And though indeed I do not greatly care
    If this be true or no,
    I really think it must be partly so;
    For no one understands me in this house,
    I am not able all alone to rouse
    Them up. They just ignore me everywhere.
    I begin to think that I’m not quite all there.

        [_She sinks her head desperately between her hands._]

                                  THIEF

        [_Quietly._]

    I wasn’t laughing at you.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Lifting her head quietly and recovering herself._]

    No, I knew.

                                  THIEF

    Perhaps I’ve left you rather much alone.

                                 CLIMBER

    Oh no! I think I’ve just outgrown
        My strength.

                                  THIEF

        [_Quietly._]

    Then if you’ve got that length
    You’ve come into your own. Lie down again;
    I’ll call you if he is in pain.

                                 CLIMBER

    No! No! This time I must lie still
    Unless he comes himself. He’d take it ill
    If I should offer him a change of diet
    He’s not accustomed to. I must lie quiet
    Unless he says that he’s prepared to try it.

        [_She lies down again. The stage gradually becomes quite
        dark, as the Thief sings this song._]

                               THIEF’S SONG

    God gave me a little fire,
    And, as He did require,
    I burnt it all away,
    And He gave me more each day.
    At last to one most dear
    I denied my fire in fear,
    And now the light’s gone out,
    And God’s nowhere about.

        [_At this moment the eight-day clock in the corner of the
        room strikes twelve slowly, and a great Hand comes in at
        the hole in the centre of the roof. All have fallen asleep
        except the Thief. She springs up with a cry and shakes the
        Climber, who does not stir, but all the others start up,
        and Finn calls loudly on the Gripper, who lays hold on the
        Hand and takes it in to the two eyebrows at the chimney.
        The Hand gives a pull on the Gripper, and takes him out to
        the top of his two shoulders. The Gripper gives another
        pull on the Hand and brings it in to the neck. The Hand
        gives a pull on the Gripper, and brings him out to the very
        middle. The Gripper gives a pull on the Hand, and brings
        it in over the two armpits. The Hand gives a pull on the
        Gripper, and takes him out to the smalls of his two feet.
        Then the Gripper gives a brave pull on the Hand, and it
        comes out of the shoulder, and when it falls on the floor
        the pulling of seven geldings is in it. All shout with
        joy._]

                                   FINN

        [_Wiping his brow in unutterable relief._]

    What an escape! I nearly lost the child!
    She’d have been wild!
    I knew I could hold out
    Without having to shout
        For aid.

        [_At this moment the Giant, unnoticed, puts in his other
        hand and takes the child with him in the cap of the hand.
        It screams, awaking the Climber._]

                                 CLIMBER

    Oh! You’ve let it go!
    You’ve been asleep, I know!

                                   FINN

        [_Desperately, with his head in his hands._]

    What a mistake I’ve made!

        [_Furiously, to the Gripper._]

    You fool! Why couldn’t you
    Hold on a little longer?

                                 GRIPPER

        [_Plaintively and with resignation._]

    Because I never knew
    There was another Hand a little stronger.

                                   FINN

        [_Frantically, to Marksman._]

    You that’s so good at marking eggs,
    Why couldn’t you tell other folk
        About the yolk?

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Tranquilly._]

    You never asked me, or I would have told.
        Are you not old
    Enough—have you not got two legs,
    A pair of hands, a level
        Enough head
    (When all is done and said)
    From which to deduce the devil?

                                   FINN

        [_Losing all control._]

    Liar! It was your duty to tell!

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Quietly and sorrowfully._]

    Go to Hell.

        [_Finn rushes out. The Climber is all this time kneeling by
        the settle with her head buried in her hands, and does not
        appear to hear anything around her._]

                                CARPENTER

        [_Angrily, to Marksman._]

    Didn’t the woman tell her that the Giant
    Who steals the children was just like a man?
    If we had known we wouldn’t have been so pliant.

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Turning to look at him with a strange smile._]

    Why didn’t you ask her about him? She never can
    Tell you very much until
    You ask her of your own free will.

                                CARPENTER

        [_Sneeringly._]

    I don’t believe she knew!

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Turning and looking at him._]

    Don’t you?

                                CARPENTER

        [_Trying to look him in the face, but getting very red,
        drops his eyes and mutters._]

    Well, maybe she did. You needn’t make a stir,
    I don’t pretend to understand folk like her.

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_As before._]

    Don’t you?

                                CARPENTER

        [_Defiantly and reluctantly._]

    Well, if I do it’s not because I can’t.

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_As before._]

    Isn’t it?

        [_Silence._]

    Come, answer me!

                                CARPENTER

        [_Defiantly._]

    I shan’t!

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Letting him go with a contemptuous kick from behind._]

    Then follow Finn until you’ve learned compliance.

                                CARPENTER

        [_Calling Tracker._]

    Come on! Let’s show them we’ve some self-reliance!

                                 TRACKER

        [_To Gripper, who is still standing quietly holding the arm
        he has pulled out._]

    Come on! There’s no use holding any more
    To the sneck of _that_ door.

        [_Pointing to arm._]

                                 GRIPPER

    Where are you going?

        [_He looks undecided._]

                                 TRACKER

    There’s no knowing,
    I’m bound to follow him.

        [_Points to Carpenter._]

                                 GRIPPER

        [_Looking round doubtfully._]

    The light is very dim,
    Where is he taking us?

                                CARPENTER

        [_Pulling him by the collar._]

    Come on without any more fuss.

                                 TRACKER

        [_Pulling at the Hand._]

    Drop it, I say, drop it!

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Intervening sternly._]

    Stop it!

        [_The Tracker and the Carpenter fling out after Finn._]

                                  THIEF

        [_To Marksman._]

    I’ll follow them. I musn’t be inhuman,
    They’ll certainly get lost without a woman.

                                 MARKSMAN

    Take care, they’ve gone to Hell.

                                  THIEF

        [_Quietly indicating the Climber._]

    Look after this child well,
    And I will steal all Heaven before you can tell.

                                 LISTENER

        [_Eagerly._]

    What fun! May I come too?

                                  THIEF

        [_Pointing to the Climber._]

    Not yet, she’s need of you.

        [_Exit Thief._]

                                 LISTENER

        [_Coming forward and gazing up at the hole in the roof with
        his hands on his knees._]

    Well, that was a clean sweep!

        [_To Climber._]

    I say, don’t weep!

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_With his finger on his lips._]

    Hush! She’s saying her prayers!

                                 LISTENER

        [_Abashed and embarrassed._]

    Oh, sorry!

        [_He crosses to the window and leans out, and then softly
        beckons to the Gripper. The Marksman is sitting quietly in
        Finn’s chair by the fire._]

                                 LISTENER

        [_To Gripper, speaking softly not to disturb the Climber._]

    Look at the sky, and that green stretch of clear
    Behind the Bidean! There’s really no night here.

        [_He sits astride the window whistling softly, and then
        begins to sing this song under his breath._]

    I had a vision of Hope. She came to me
    Long before morning came, long ere the day
    Had folded night in her bosom and gathered away
        The stars in her brightness;
        I saw as it were a whiteness
        Like a shimmer on the sea;
        Long before morning broke
            She awoke
          And came to me.

    There are some who never see her,
    There are some who never hear
        Her whisper at their ear.
        I was awake and heard
          Before the thrushes stirred.

    Deep in her heart she showed me,
    Long before it was spring,
        A lovely thing.
    All the April bulbs unsleeping,
    Beneath the garden keeping
        Watch for the dawn,
    All the eyes of the daisies wide-awake under the lawn.

    There are some who will not trust her,
    There are some who blindly thrust her
        Out of sight
        Into the solitary night.
    Grievous souls! They do not know
    That her lovely sign is true:
        I listened and I knew.

                                 MARKSMAN

    That’s good enough!

        [_Climber springs up lightly._]

                                 CLIMBER

    Why! Where’s Finn?

                                 LISTENER

        [_Coming down._]

    Gone off in the huff
    While you were saying your prayers.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Desperately, to Marksman._]

    I don’t believe it! Tell me there’s
    No truth in what he said.

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Quietly._]

    Yes, for the present, Finn is dead.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Quietly steadfast._]

    I don’t believe it.

                                 MARKSMAN

    He has lost his head.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Looking round._]

    Where are the others?

                                 GRIPPER

        [_Sarcastically._]

    They’ve followed him like brothers.

                                 CLIMBER

    Has the Thief gone with the rest?

                                 MARKSMAN

    Yes; she thought it best.
    She said it was inhuman
    To let them go without a woman.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Radiantly, with upraised face._]

    Thank you!

                                 LISTENER

        [_To Marksman._]

    Who’s she speaking to?

        [_The Marksman quietly shoots an arrow out of the window._]

                                 LISTENER

    Why did you do that?

                                 MARKSMAN

    Being under my protection
    She looked straight in the right direction.

                                 LISTENER

        [_Who has run to the window to look after the arrow._]

    I say! They’ve put off in the boat
    And left us all behind!

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Anxiously._]

    Has Finn got his coat?

                                 LISTENER

    No; there it is behind
    The press.

                                 CLIMBER

    Is the Thief there?

                                 LISTENER

    Yes.

                                 CLIMBER

    Then never mind.

        [_To Gripper._]

    Come! You must follow
    And take the tiller, or the sea will swallow
          Them all.

                                 GRIPPER

        [_Plaintively._]

    It’s no use; I would fall
    Without something to grip.

                                 CLIMBER

    Are you afraid to slip
    If I make fast
    A rope to the mast?

                                 GRIPPER

        [_Brightening._]

    Oh no! not if you give me anything
    To hold to, even the smallest bit of string.
    But how will you get over there?
    It’s far too rough to swim. Take care!

                                 CLIMBER

        [_To Listener._]

    Can you hear
    What the Thief is saying?

                                 LISTENER

        [_Putting his ear to the ground and listening intently._]

    I rather think she’s praying.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Clapping her hands delightedly._]

    Then come along, the danger’s past,
    I’ve tied a life-line to the mast!

        [_Exit all running eagerly, the Climber carrying Finn’s
        coat._]




ACT III. SCENE 3

AT SEA: SUNSET


_A stormy dark sunset, late in the gloaming. The ship is seen tossing
wildly on a tempestuous sea. The Thief is sitting quietly in the stern
with her head bowed; her face is invisible. The Carpenter and the Tracker
are whimpering on the floor. Finn is alone at the helm, but the waves are
driving the boat about at their mercy._

                                CARPENTER

        [_Terrified, from bottom of boat._]

    I don’t believe this boat is sound.

                                 TRACKER

        [_Blubbering with terror._]

    Boohoo! Boohoo! We’s all going to be drowned!

        [_Clutches Finn’s legs._]

                                   FINN

        [_Spurning him suddenly._]

    Be quiet, you fool!

        [_The Tracker collapses howling in a corner._]

                                CARPENTER

    Cheer up! You’ll soon be able to keep cool.

        [_A great shower of spray comes over and drenches them. The
        Tracker cries despairingly._]

                                CARPENTER

        [_To Finn._]

    I had a sense of something due
    To someone, though I scare kent who,
    And like a fool I lent my ship to you.
    Although I made her at my own expense
    I thought you had a little common sense.
    Didn’t I tell you she was bound
    To carry you quite safe and sound
    From earth to Heaven, if you could handle
    Her properly. It’s a fair scandal
    To see the way you hold the tiller.
    You’ll sink her. Look! You’ll sink and fill her!

        [_The ship heels and dips, the Tracker yells again, and
        even the Carpenter gasps and moans._]

    I thought that she would even carry
    God back again to earth to tarry.
    Oh! If she’d had another master
    Than you, she would have got on faster,
    But with this God-forsaken mind
    No other body could I find.

                                 TRACKER

        [_To Carpenter, blubbering._]

    I’d like to tell you what I think
    Of you.

                                CARPENTER

    I jalouse we must sink
    Our differences for a little;
    This boat won’t stand it, she’s too brittle.

        [_The boat gives a wild lurch and appears to founder. Both
        cry wildly to Finn. The Tracker clutches the Thief’s knees,
        weeping loudly._]

                                  THIEF

        [_Quietly._]

    Have patience!

                                   FINN

        [_Looking desperately up to the sky._]

    If there is any Truth in what she said,
    If there is any Hope that answers prayer,
    If there is any Faith beyond her share
    That stretches nervous from a lovelier Head
    Than ours, and quickens in the brighter dead,
    I summon all my strong human emotion
    To stir that Brain to feel what I am feeling,
    And rouse a Thought of which I had no notion
    Into consideration of my healing,
    For though my mind is smaller than That Other
    I have enough of sense to call it Brother
    If It be there at all. If It be there.

        [_At his words a golden life-line is suddenly whirled on
        board and falls at his feet. The Carpenter and the Tracker
        cry wildly: “A rope! A rope! Oh, make it fast!”_]

                                  THIEF

        [_With a sigh of relief._]

    The danger’s past!

        [_She runs hurriedly and makes the rope fast to the mast,
        while Finn remains gazing at it as if dazed. In a moment
        the Climber is seen swinging along it, immediately followed
        by the Gripper, the Listener, and the Marksman. Finn
        remains as if spellbound, while the Gripper runs to the
        tiller, seizes it from him, and turns the boat completely
        round._]

                                   FINN

        [_To himself, as if bewildered._]

    This is more than any sense deserves!

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Shaking her head at him._]

    Fancy going off like that in an open boat
    Without your coat!
    Your state of mind is preying on my nerves.

        [_She helps him into his coat, which he submits to
        passively, gazing at her as if dazed; then suddenly falling
        on his knees, he snatches her hand, crying exultantly—_]

                                   FINN

    Before the sun shall rise upon the land
    I’ll shake all darkness by this other hand!

        [_The storm gradually abates, and as the ship slips away
        the Gripper leans back against the tiller and sings._]

                              GRIPPER’S SONG

    I saw above the straining shrouds
    No rift nor hint of dawn,
    I saw no light beyond the clouds,
    But still I carried on.

    I saw the end of the world, Dear Heart,
    And I believed it true,
    But still I held to my small part,
    And so she carried through.




ACT IV

THE GIANT’S CASTLE: MIDNIGHT


_In a dim twilight of stars a castle is seen upon a rock. It is thatched
with eel-skins, and there appears to be neither door nor window. The dark
figures of Finn, the Climber, the Thief, the Marksman, and the Listener
are presently seen stealing softly over the rocks. The other three have
evidently remained with the boat. They talk in whispers._

                                   FINN

        [_To Climber._]

    Is this the place?

                                 CLIMBER

    I believe so.

                                   FINN

    It’s very dark,
    I cannot see your face.

                                 LISTENER

    Hark!

                                   FINN

        [_Nervously._]

    What is it?

                                 LISTENER

    I hear something inside,
    It sounds like children’s voices.
    Have you tried
    The door?

                                   FINN

    There isn’t any door.

                                 LISTENER

        [_Positively._]

    I really hear
    Something, I don’t know what. It sounds quite near.

                                 CLIMBER

    If there’s no front door there must be a stair,
    I’m certain he has put the child in there;
    And since it must have got inside somehow,
    I rather think the door is in the brow.
    At any rate, I’m going to climb and see.

                                   FINN

        [_Anxiously._]

    Take care! The thatch is very slippery!

                                 LISTENER

        [_Cheerfully._]

    If there’s a way in, then there is no doubt
    There must be just the same way to get out.

        [_The Climber’s figure is soon dimly seen silhouetted on
        the roof against the stars._]

                                 CLIMBER

        [_With a delighted exclamation._]

    Just as I thought!

                                   FINN

        [_Nervously._]

    What?

                                 CLIMBER

    I’ve found a door just where I thought.

                                   FINN

    Can you open it?

                                 CLIMBER

    Oh yes, there’s not
    Much difficulty there,
    It comes away with prayer.

        [_She is seen kneeling._]

                                   FINN

    What’s that you’re saying?

                                 LISTENER

    Be quiet! Can’t you see she’s praying?

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Presently._]

    It’s opening up!

                                   FINN

        [_Eagerly._]

    What is inside?

                                 CLIMBER

    I’m looking, but I haven’t tried
    My eyes yet in a night so deep.

        [_She calls down softly presently._]

    The Giant is sound asleep!

                                   FINN

    Oh! Can you see if he’s still got the child
    Inside the cap
    Of the other hand?

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Delighted._]

    It’s there! It’s still taking its little nap!

                                   FINN

        [_Desperately._]

    If only I were strong enough to creep
    Inside and steal it while he is asleep!
    But with this heavy box I can’t get up.

                                 LISTENER

    Why don’t you throw it away then altogether?

                                   FINN

        [_Arrested._]

    I wonder if I could? I don’t know whether—

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Calling down._]

    There’s a dog here too besides, and a little pup!

                                   FINN

    Abominable! They’re sure to bark.

                                 LISTENER

        [_Delighted._]

    I say! A puppy! What a lark!
    Please try and get it for me. Hark!

                                   FINN

        [_Nervously._]

    What is it?

                                 LISTENER

    I hear the Giant coming up out of his sleep.
    You must be quick,
    Or else you’ll stick.

                                  THIEF

        [_To Climber._]

    I’m almost certain I could creep
    And steal the child while he is sleeping,
    Only I’m rather old to do much leaping;
    You’d have to carry me a bit,
    And let me gently down to it.

                                 CLIMBER

    All right! There is no difficulty there.
    With your support I could go anywhere.

        [_She swings down, takes the Thief on her back, and is
        presently seen on the roof letting her gently down inside
        the castle. The Climber is seen again kneeling._]

                                   FINN

        [_Anxiously, from below._]

    Oh dear! How slow she is! It’s very dark.
    Why is she delaying?

                                 LISTENER

    Be quiet! Can’t you see she’s praying?
        Hark!

                                   FINN

        [_Nervously._]

    What is it now?

                                 LISTENER

        [_Joyously._]

    I hear the child coming up out of his sleep.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Calling softly down to the Thief._]

    It is so deep
    Inside, I can’t see where you are.

                                 LISTENER

        [_Anxiously._]

    Has she got the puppy?

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Reassuringly._]

    She’ll get it all right, never fear!

                                 LISTENER

        [_Whispering loudly._]

    Good man!
    I say! Can
    You hand it down and let me hold its muzzle?
    I guess to both of you it is a puzzle
    To know at present where to put it,
    And if Finn sees it probably he’ll shoot it.

                                   FINN

        [_Anxiously._]

    Has she got the child? I can’t endure
    To wait like this.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_A trifle hesitatingly._]

                    I think so. I’m not sure.

                                 LISTENER

    Be quick! I hear the dog coming up out of her sleep.

                              THIEF’S VOICE

        [_From within, faintly._]

    Oh! Lower me again to Mother Earth,
    For I in spirit have been called as far
    As the secret place where her lost children are,
    And I now bring them back to second birth,
    Rescuing both the body and the soul
    Out of the Hand of death entire and whole,
    If you are strong enough to bear us back
    To the same side from which we came.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Reeling with the sudden relaxation of nervous tension._]

                                        Alack!
    I am as wearied as a falling star,
    I cannot do it alone.

        [_At this moment the Hand is seen emerging from the roof.
        It grips the Climber and takes her in._]

                                   FINN

        [_With a frantic cry._]

    Where are
    They? Oh! My God, what shall I do?

                                 MARKSMAN

    Put your finger underneath your wisdom tooth
    And find what it replies.

                                   FINN

        [_Doing so._]

    It says that I must tell the truth.

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Sternly._]

    Confess your previous lies!

        [_Finn hides his face with a groan._]

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Gently._]

    You need fear no disgrace
    If you will look me in the face.

                                   FINN

        [_Trembling._]

    I’m thinking that there are not many here
    Can look you in the face without some fear.

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Quietly._]

    If you are too shy
    I cannot help you at all. You must all die.

        [_He turns away._]

                                   FINN

        [_Clutching him by the shoulder._]

    No! No! No!

        [_The Marksman turns and gazes at him. Finn remains
        upright, his eyes riveted on the Marksman’s._]

                                   FINN

        [_Steadily._]

    I told her I was wide enough awake.

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Quietly._]

    That was a great mistake.

                                   FINN

    I told her I could quite well do
    Without her aid.

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Quietly._]

    That was untrue.

                                   FINN

    I told her that I did not feel
    The slightest pain. Her dream was real,

        [_He points to the box._]

    For overburdened with this weight
    Of earth, I was in such a state
    I really could not recognize
    Myself reflected in her eyes.
    I felt in such a deep disgrace
    I could not look her in the face,
    So when she brought her dream by and by
    I put her off. Trying to deny
    My God, I told a fearful lie.

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Tranquilly._]

    She never believed it, and she marked it die
    Dwindling slowly away
    As the light grew stronger and the grey
    Faded for ever from the windows.

        [_He points to the faint line of green, which is now
        showing on the horizon._]

    In the cottages they will soon be putting out all the lamps
    And going about their work in unreflected light.

                                   FINN

        [_Springing up with a cry of joy._]

    What! Is it really all right?

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Quietly._]

    Yes, quite;
    You’ve told me all that I require
    To set you free.

                                   FINN

        [_Now a different man._]

    If God be true no man can be a liar.
    Come, follow me.

                                 LISTENER

    Where are you going?

                                   FINN

        [_Eagerly and joyously._]

    I’m going after the Climber,
    Her point of view’s sublimer.
    I’m going to throw away my bow.

        [_He casts the box from him._]

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Picking up the box._]

    Take care, you’ve not much yet on which to go!

                                   FINN

        [_Radiantly._]

    I cannot fall,
    The way she chose is practical!

                                 LISTENER

    Since you have let her in for this, no doubt
    You’re bound to find a way to get her out.

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Turning on a little electric torch to light Finn._]

    It’s still a little dark to-night.
    I’ve put things in the proper light
    For you, but it strikes me
    I’ll have to clear up more before you’ll see
    Her way out of the difficulty.

        [_Finn reaches the roof in safety, and calls down
        anxiously._]

                                   FINN

    Are you there? Are you there?

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Calling faintly from within._]

    Oh! Have you come? I knew you’d not be long,
    I’d noticed you were getting very strong.
    He’s tied me hand and foot. I cannot move,
    I’ve found the Thief and he are hand in glove!

                                   FINN

    No matter! I’m entirely of your mind.
    I’ll find
    My way inside and get you out just now.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Anxiously._]

    The door is just behind your brow.

                                   FINN

        [_Hitting his forehead._]

    I’ve got it!

        [_His figure is seen against the dim twilight kneeling._]

                                 LISTENER

    Be quick! I hear the Giant coming up out of his sleep!

        [_The Hand takes in Finn._]

                             CLIMBER’S VOICE

        [_With a muffled cry of despair._]

    Too late! Too late! My God, what shall I do?

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Hurriedly, calling from below._]

    Put your finger under your wisdom tooth and tell me what it replies.

                             CLIMBER’S VOICE

    It says that I must tell the truth!

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Very sternly._]

    What! You as well! Confess your previous lies!

                             CLIMBER’S VOICE

    It is so dark I cannot see your face,
    I feel that I’m in very deep disgrace.
    Alas! I told him that I was asleep!

                                 MARKSMAN

    Your error there was truly very deep.

                                 CLIMBER

    I thought that I was strong enough
    To return alone.

                                 MARKSMAN

    What utter stuff!

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Desperately._]

    I said I thought he was in pain;
    The pain was mine, for in my brain
    I felt a tugging and a stress
    I could not understand, unless
    One in the likeness of a man
    Had summoned me to Heaven. I ran,
    I climbed, I reached the topmost stair,
    And found that I was not all there,
    For if I’d left the earth behind
    I should have gone out of my mind,
    Since God requires a soul and body too
    To make the substance of His dream come true.
    I understood God did devise
    To make this earth His Paradise;
    I saw our second birth was got
    Just out of earth by happy thought,
    But fearful that a Truth so glad
    Would seem an impudence half-mad,
    I made him think that God’s design
    Was just a silly dream of mine.

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Quietly._]

    He always believed your dream;
    He marked it grow
    Out upon his sleep with bewildered joy,
    Until at last, just like a little boy,
    He put his hand up in the dark to feel
    Her face, and found he had touched something real.

        [_He opens the box and takes the rainbow from it._]

    In the cottages they have put out all the lamps,
    And go about their work in unreflected light.

                                 LISTENER

        [_Excitedly._]

The Giant is coming up out of his sleep for the last time, and he is
bringing the dog with him!

                                 MARKSMAN

        [_Quietly._]

    I am not afraid of myself, you need not shout,
    For I am strong enough to bear them out.

        [_At this moment the Hand rises again from the chimney.
        The Marksman is seen stringing the rainbow and letting fly
        an arrow, which transfixes the Hand. There is terrible
        darkness for a moment, the stars fall from the sky and the
        moon turns crimson, leaving pitchy night. With a loud crash
        the walls of the castle fall away, and in a serene silent
        splendour of purple and crimson the dawn rises over the
        sea, revealing the Big Young Hero standing upon the rock
        with the child in his arms. The Climber and Finn are in
        each other’s arms, the Thief is holding the puppy._]

                                 MARKSMAN

    They have all come up out of their sleep for ever!

                                 LISTENER

        [_With a great cry of joy._]

    I always knew this would happen! She’s got the puppy too!




ACT V

THE GREEN ISLE REALIZED ON EARTH. DAWN


_The same as Act I, but this time there is no rainbow haze between, only
a great rainbow stretching in the sky across the Hebrides seen in the
distance. On a table under the trees the girl has spread all sorts of
delightful fruits and cakes. She is now decorating it with flowers, and
singing as she works._

                                   SONG

    I love all lovely things—
    The dragon-fly’s wings,
    The rainbow and the rain,
    The light that comes again
    Joyously like a smile,
    When for a little while
    God disposes the night elsewhere.

    His sun is very fair,
    I can catch it in my hair.
    Look! It’s there! And there! And there!
    Oh! the earth’s a lovely thing,
    The mind of a Mighty King,
    I cannot help but sing.
    I cannot end my song,
    God’s thought is very long.
    Many years He took to make
    The bracken in the brake;
    He was a long time building
    The fragrant yellow gilding
    On the early poplar tree
    When no eye was there to see.

    The clouds, the atmosphere,
    My breath, the water clear,
    How fair and sweet they are!
    Oh! hate was very far
    From God’s divine intention
    When these things He did mention;
    When He canopied the earth
    With cloud, and fire, and mirth;
    When He set the privy shade
    For the pheasant in the glade;
    When He built the mossy nest
    For the wren, His little guest;
    When He taught the mind of man
    By its love to find His plan.

    For no one shall discover
    His science, save the lover.
    Oh! Life’s a lovely thing,
    The mind of a Mighty King!
    Emotion, will, desire,
    Earth, water, air, and fire,
    The elements intertwined,
    With these He built the mind;
    The love of green things growing,
    The shadows they keep throwing
    Across man’s fiery thought
    Till they’re fused and merged and wrought
    Into the liquid union
    Of one divine communion
    With God, Who made his college
    An earthly place of knowledge.

    I cannot help but sing,
    Life’s such a lovely thing!
    The catkin and the willow
    God’s chosen for His pillow.
    I wonder why He fashioned
    A Beauty so impassioned;
    I wonder why it matters
    Which way the raindrop patters,
    Or why a God should care
    To give His creatures share
    Of this delightful song.
    His love must be very strong.

    I cannot end my singing,
    For still the starling’s winging
    With a straw held in her beak
    To build in the old tree-peak;
    And still across the sky
    The compacted clouds go by;
    And when God thinks upon it
    The lily’s yellow bonnet
    Nid-nods delightfully
    Beneath the walnut tree.
    And clear, and still more clear,
    In God’s mind I read and hear
    That only Love shall learn
    The wherefore of flower and fern,
    That only Love alone
    Shall live to be full-grown,
    That merely Love and Wonder
    Shall bring all Heaven hereunder.

        [_Towards the end of the song the brown-sailed fishing-boat
        is seen approaching gradually under the rainbow. As it
        draws near, Finn and the Big Young Hero are seen in it with
        the puppy. It touches the shore, at first unperceived of
        the girl. The Big Young Hero leaps lightly from it, and
        helps Finn out._]

                                   FINN

        [_Looking round bewildered._]

    I recognize this place.

                                   HERO

    You have been here before.

                                   FINN

    Isn’t that the Bidean’s face?

        [_Pointing to the distant hills._]

    Please tell me, for I can’t stand any more.

        [_He staggers, but the Hero puts an arm round him._]

    There must be some mistake,
        I seem
    To be asleep and yet I am awake.
        Is this a dream?

                                   HERO

    No, it is real.
    Put up your hand and feel
    Her face.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_Perceiving him, calls._]

    The breakfast’s ready, I have set your place.

        [_Catching sight of Finn she puts her hand to her face with
        a cry of amazed delight._]

    It is the man I dreamed about last night!
    I didn’t know! I’m looking such a sight!
    I didn’t know that you would bring a guest.

        [_She puts her hand up to her head as if she were going to
        fall, and the Hero puts his other arm round her._]

    I’ll be all right after a little rest.
    What a beautiful rainbow!

        [_Pointing._]

    I always knew the morning would be fine.

                                   FINN

        [_Putting his hand up in amazement to find the box is
        gone._]

    It’s mine!
    How did it get up there?

                                   HERO

    You hoisted it on a prayer;
    The Marksman’s left it in the sky to show
    The right direction to the folk below.
    The others are not very far behind;
    Presently they will all be of your mind.

        [_He points to where, far off under the bow, the sails of
        Conan’s boat are dimly visible on the horizon._]

                                   FINN

        [_Wild with delight._]

    Oh! I feel strong enough to turn the moon
    Right round upon his other face,
    And I feel ready now to sup
    The stars up with a spoon.

                                 CLIMBER

        [_In an awed whisper, gazing at Finn._]

    I only know I am aware
    Of God for ever, everywhere.

                                   HERO

        [_Who has still an arm round either, to Finn._]

    It was the Gate of Heaven that you carried.
    Now it is time that you and she were married.
    Since I have found you strong enough to share
    Her faith that I am more than quite all there,
    Ask what you will, it shall be given you
    As your reward. Tell me, what is your due?

                                   FINN

        [_In a whisper._]

    I am beginning now to understand!
    Lord, I beseech, help Thou mine other hand.

                                   HERO

        [_Leading the two forward to the table, he takes the
        Climber’s hand and places it in Finn’s._]

    It has spread breakfast in my house for two,
    The other place was always meant for you;
    I pray you, warm it at your hearth hereunder.
    What I have joined let no man put asunder.




APPENDIX

_HOW FINN KEPT HIS CHILDREN FOR THE BIG YOUNG HERO OF THE SHIP AND HOW
BRAN WAS FOUND._


A day Finn and his men were in the Hunting-hill they killed a great
number of deer; and when they were wearied after the chase they sat down
on a pleasant green knoll, at the back of the wind and at the face of the
sun, where they could see everyone and no one at all could see them.

While they were sitting in that place Finn lifted his eyes towards the
sea, and saw a ship making straight for the haven beneath the spot on
which they were sitting. When the ship came to land, a Big Young Hero
leaped out of her on the shore, seized her by the bows and drew her
up, her own seven lengths, on the green grass, where the eldest son of
neither landowner nor of holder of large townland dared mock or gibe at
her. Then he ascended the hillside, leaping over the hollows and slanting
the knolls, till he reached the spot on which Finn and his men were
sitting.

He saluted Finn frankly, energetically, fluently; and Finn saluted him
with the equivalent of the same words. Finn then asked him whence did he
come or what was he wanting? He answered Finn that he had come through
night-watching and tempest of sea where he was, because he was losing his
children, and it had been told him that there was not a man in the world
who could keep his children for him but him, Finn, King of the Feinne.
And he said to Finn, “I lay on thee, as crosses and spells and seven
fairy fetters of travelling and straying, to be with me before thou shalt
eat food or drink a draught or close an eye in sleep.”

Having said this he turned away from them and descended the hillside
the way he ascended it. When he reached the ship he placed his shoulder
against her bow and put her out. He then leaped into her, and departed in
the direction he came until they lost sight of him.

Finn was now under great heaviness of mind, because the vows had been
laid on him, and he must fulfil them or travel onwards until he would
die. He knew not whither he should go, or what he should do. But he left
farewell with his men, and descended the hillside to the seaside. When he
reached that he could not go farther on the way in which he saw the Big
Young Hero depart. He therefore began to walk along the shore, but before
he had gone very far forward, he saw a company of seven men coming to
meet him.

When he reached the men he asked the first of them what was he good at?
The man answered that he was a good Carpenter. Finn asked him how good
was he at carpentry? The man said that, with three strokes of his axe
he could make a large, capacious, complete ship of the alder stock over
yonder. “Thou art good enough,” said Finn; “thou mayest pass by.”

He then asked of the second man what was he good at? The man said that he
was a good Tracker. “How good art thou?” said Finn. “I can track the wild
duck over the crests of the nine waves within nine days,” said the man.
“Thou art good enough,” said Finn; “thou mayest pass by.”

Then he said to the third man, “What art thou good at?” The man replied
that he was a good Gripper. “How good art thou?” “The hold I once get I
will not let go until my two arms come from my shoulders or until my
hold comes with me.” “Thou art good enough; thou mayest pass by.”

Then he said to the fourth man, “What art thou good at?” He answered that
he was a good Climber. “How good art thou?” “I can climb on a filament of
silk to the stars, although thou wert to tie it there.” “Thou art good
enough; thou mayest pass by.”

He then said to the fifth man, “What art thou good at?” He replied that
he was a good Thief. “How good art thou?” “I can steal the egg from the
heron while her two eyes are looking at me.” “Thou art good enough; thou
mayest pass by.”

He asked of the sixth man, “What art thou good at?” He answered that he
was a good Listener. “How good art thou?” He said that he could hear what
people were saying at the extremity of the Uttermost World (Domhan Tor).
“Thou art good enough; thou mayest pass by.”

Then he said to the seventh man, “What art thou good at?” He replied that
he was a good Marksman. “How good art thou?” “I could hit an egg as far
away in the sky as bowstring could send or bow could carry.” “Thou art
good enough; thou mayest pass by.”

All this gave Finn great encouragement. He turned round and said to the
Carpenter, “Prove thy skill.” The Carpenter went where the stock was, and
struck it with his axe thrice; and as he had said, the Ship was ready.

When Finn saw the Ship ready he ordered his men to put her out. They did
that and went on board of her.

Finn now ordered the Tracker to go to the bow and prove himself. At the
same time he told him that yesterday a Big Young Hero left yonder haven
in his ship and that he wanted to follow the Hero to the place in which
he now was. Finn himself went to steer the Ship and they departed. The
Tracker was telling him to keep her this way or to keep her that way.
They sailed a long time forward without seeing land, but they kept on
their course until evening was approaching. In the gloaming they noticed
that land was ahead of them, and they made straight for it. When they
reached the shore they leaped to land and drew up the Ship.

Then they noticed a large fine house in the glen above the beach. They
took their way up to the house; and when they were nearing it they saw
the Big Young Hero coming to meet them. He ran and placed his two arms
about Finn’s neck and said, “Darling of all men in the world, hast thou
come?” “If I had been thy darling of all men in the world, it is not as
thou didst leave me that thou wouldst have left me,” said Finn. “Oh, it
was not without a way of coming that I left thee,” said the Big Young
Hero. “Did I not send a company of seven men to meet thee?”

When they reached the house, the Big Young Hero told Finn and his men to
go in. They accepted the invitation and found abundance of meat and drink.

After they had quenched their hunger and thirst, the Big Young Hero came
in where they were, and said to Finn, “Six years from this night, my wife
was in childbed and a child was born to me. As soon as the child came
into the world, a large Hand came in at the chimney, and took the child
with it in the cap (or hollow) of the Hand. Three years from this night
the same thing happened. And to-night she is going to be in childbed
again. It was told me that thou wert the only man in the world who could
keep my children for me, and now I have courage since I have found thee.”

Finn and his men were tired and sleepy. Finn said to the men that they
were to stretch themselves on the floor and that he was going to keep
watch. They did as they were told and he remained sitting beside the
fire. At last sleep began to come on him; but he had a bar of iron in the
fire, and as often as his eyes would begin to close with sleep, he would
thrust the bar through the bone of his palm, and that was keeping him
awake. About midnight the woman was delivered, and as soon as the child
came into the world the Hand came in at the chimney. Finn called on the
Gripper to get up.

The Gripper sprang quickly to his feet and laid hold of the Hand. He gave
a pull on the Hand, and took it in to the two eyebrows at the chimney.

The Hand gave a pull on the Gripper, and took him out to the top of his
two shoulders. The Gripper gave another pull on the Hand, and brought it
in to the neck. The Hand gave a pull on the Gripper, and brought him out
to the very middle. The Gripper gave a pull on the Hand and took it in
over the two armpits. The Hand gave a pull on the Gripper and took him
out to the smalls of his two feet. Then the Gripper gave a brave pull on
the Hand, and it came out of the shoulder. And when it fell on the floor
the pulling of seven geldings was in it. But the big Giant outside put in
the other hand and took the child with him in the cap of the Hand.

They were all very sorry that they lost the child. But Finn said, “We
will not yield to this yet. I and my men will go away after the Hand
before a sun shall rise on a dwelling to-morrow.”

At break of dawn Finn and his men turned out, and reached the beach where
they had left the Ship.

They launched the Ship, and leaped on board of her. The Tracker went to
the bow, and Finn went to steer her. They departed, and now and again
the Tracker would cry to Finn to keep her in that direction, or to keep
her in this direction. They sailed onward a long distance without seeing
anything before them, except the great sea. At the going down of the sun,
Finn noticed a black spot in the ocean ahead of them. He thought it too
little for an island and too large for a bird, but he made straight for
it; and it was a rock, and a Castle thatched with eel-skins was on its
top.

They landed on the rock. They looked about the Castle but they saw
neither window nor door at which they could get in. At last they noticed
that it was on the roof the door was. They did not know how they could
get up, because the thatch was so slippery. But the Climber cried,
“Let me over and I will not be long in climbing it.” He sprang quickly
towards the Castle and in an instant was on its roof. He looked in at the
door, and after taking particular notice of everything that he saw, he
descended where the rest were waiting. Finn asked of him what did he see?
He said that he saw a big Giant lying on a bed, a silk covering over him
and a satin covering under him, and his hand stretched out and an infant
asleep in the cap of the Hand; that he saw two boys on the floor playing
with shinties of gold and a ball of silver; and that there was a very
large deer-hound bitch lying beside the fire, and two pups sucking her.

Then said Finn, “I do not know how we shall get them out.” The Thief
answered and said, “If I get in I will not be long putting them out.” The
Climber said, “Come on my back and I will take thee up to the door.” The
Thief did as he was told and got into the Castle.

Instantly he began to prove his skill. The first thing he put out was
the child that was in the cap of the Hand. He then put out the two boys
who were playing on the floor. He then stole the silk covering that was
over the Giant and the satin covering that was under him, and put them
out. Then he put out the shinties of gold and the ball of silver. He then
stole the two pups that were sucking the bitch beside the fire. These
were the most valuable things which he saw inside. He left the Giant
asleep and turned out.

They placed the things which the Thief stole in the Ship and departed.
They were but a short time sailing when the Listener stood up and said,
“’Tis I who am hearing him, ’tis I who am listening to him!” “What art
thou hearing?” said Finn. “He has just awakened,” said the Listener,
“and missed everything that was stolen from him. He is in great wrath
sending away the Bitch, and saying to her if she will not go that he will
go himself. But it is the Bitch that is going.” In a short time they
looked behind them and saw the Bitch coming swimming. She was cleaving
the sea on each side of her in red sparks of fire. They were seized with
fear, and said that they did not know what they should do. But Finn
considered, and then told them to throw out one of the pups; perhaps when
she would see the pup drowning she would return with it. They threw out
the pup, and as Finn said, it happened; the Bitch returned with the pup.
This left them at the time pleased.

But shortly after that the Listener arose trembling, and said, “’Tis
I who am hearing him, ’tis I who am listening to him!” “What art thou
saying now?” said Finn. “He is sending away the Bitch, and since she will
not go he is coming himself.”

When they heard this their eye was always behind them. At last they saw
him coming, and the great sea reached not beyond his haunches. They were
seized with fear and great horror, for they knew not what they should
do. But Finn thought of his knowledge set of teeth, and having put his
finger under it, found out that the Giant was immortal except in a mole
which was in a hollow of his palm. The Marksman then stood up and said,
“If I get one look of it I will have him.” The Giant came walking forward
through the sea to the side of the Ship. Then he lifted up his hand to
seize the top of the mast, in order to sink the Ship. But when the Hand
was on high the Marksman noticed the mole, and he let an arrow off in its
direction. The arrow struck the Giant in the death-spot and he fell dead
on the sea. They were now very happy, for there was nothing before them
to make them afraid. They put about and sailed back to the Castle. The
Thief stole the pup again, and they took it with them along with the one
they had. After that they returned to the place of the Big Young Hero.
When they reached the Haven they leaped on land and drew up the Ship on
dry ground.

Then Finn went away with the family of the Big Young Hero and with
everything which he and his men took out of the Castle to the fine house
of the Big Young Hero.

The Big Young Hero met him coming, and when he saw his children he
went on his two knees to Finn and said, “What now is thy reward?” Finn
answered and said that he was asking nothing but his choice of the two
pups which they took from the Castle. The Big Young Hero said that he
would get that and a great deal more if he would ask it. But Finn wanted
nothing except the pup. This pup was Bran, and his brother, that the Big
Young Hero got, was the Grey Dog.

The Big Young Hero took Finn and his men into his house and made for them
a great joyous merry feast, which was kept up for a year and a day, and
if the last day was not the best it was not the worst.

That is how Finn kept his children for the Big Young Hero of the Ship and
how Bran was found.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
