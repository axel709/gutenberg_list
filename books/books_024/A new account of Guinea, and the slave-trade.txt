  TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

  This book was printed in 1754 and this etext is a careful
  reproduction of that original text. No spelling and very few
  punctuation corrections have been made in order to preserve the
  historical value of the original work.

  All dates in the book are prior to 1750, and so are Julian
  calendar dates where a new year begins on March 25th. However
  the book was published in the Gregorian era, so whenever a year
  is given for a date between January 1st and March 24th, both the
  Julian and Gregorian year were printed. This is shown in the book
  with a hyphen, for example ‘the 10th day of _March_ 1718-19’.

  The long-s ſ has been replaced by s throughout the etext.

  Italic text is denoted by _underscores_.

  A superscript x is denoted by ^x.

  There is only one footnote in this book. The anchor is denoted by
  (a), and the footnote itself has been placed at the bottom of that
  paragraph.

  All the changes noted in the ERRATA have been applied to the etext,
  except for the change noted for p71, which could not be identified.
  All occurrences of Testesole have been changed to Testefole.

  A few minor corrections to obvious compositor errors are noted at
  the end of the book. Some missing quote marks have been silently
  added. All other misspellings in the text, and inconsistent or
  archaic usage, have been left unchanged.

GENTLEMEN,

Some of you having been pleased to peruse the following Sheets in
Manuscript, and been so kind, as to express your Approbation of them,
it hath incouraged me to make them publick; and I take the Liberty to
address them to the Merchants trading to the Coast of _Guinea_, as
being the best Judges of the Truth of what is here related.

As it has been my good Fortune to be known for many Years to most of
you, and to have received Favours from several amongst You, so I beg
leave to subscribe my self, with the greatest Respect and Esteem,
Gentlemen,

                                                _Your most obliged
                                                      humble Servant_,

PREFACE.


_The best part of the following Sheets were writ several Years ago,
more particularly the Account of my being taken by Pirates, in the
Year 1719: And being now induced to publish the History of the
Conquest of the Kingdom of_ Dahomè, _I have added the other, which is
as remarkable in its kind_.

_I am sensible that Objections may be made to the Account I have
given of the_ Dahomes, _by such of my Readers as are not acquainted,
either by Travelling or Reading, with the Manners and Customs of
several barbarous brutish Nations, that have been and are still on
the Globe_.

_As to human Sacrifices, they are no new thing in the World; for
it is recorded of the_ Mexicans _in particular, that they annually
sacrificed to their Gods, a great number of their Enemies taken in
War_.

_Mens eating of their own Species, seems to be the most incredible
and shocking; but this is practised by others at present_ (_besides
the_ Dahomes) _on the Coast of_ Guinea; _especially by a People
called_ Acquas, _on the River of old_ Callabar, _and amongst the_
Camarones _adjoining, where I have formerly been, and of which there
are some Witnesses now in_ London: _Captain_ Arthur Lone _and others,
having seen the same as well as my self_.

_As to the Story in general of the King of_ Dahomè, _there are
some Gentlemen now in Town, that know a great part of it; namely_,
Jeremiah Tinker _Esq_; _Governor_ Wilson, _and others, who have
formerly resided at_ Whidaw, _for the Royal_ African Company:
_Besides several that have been there in the Service of private
Merchants: As also_ Charles Dunbar _Esq; of_ Antegoa, _who bought
the_ Negroe-Woman _of me there, whose Story is so remarkable, on
account of her being thrown as a Sacrifice into the Sea, and her
wonderful Preservation afterwards, the Truth of which she has often
confirmed_.

_As to the Relation of my being taken by Pirates, there are several
in and about Town, that suffered by them, at the same time and place
with my self. And Mr._ James Bleau, _who was then my Surgeon, lives
now at_ Woodford, _in good Repute and Esteem with the Gentlemen of
that Village and Neighbourhood_.

_I shall say nothing with relation to the short Account I have given
of the manner how the_ Negroes _become Slaves, and of the Management
of them when on Shipboard, it being designed at first only for a
Friend’s Satisfaction, who had objected against the lawfulness of
that Trade_.

_As I love Freedom my self, so I readily leave the Reader to judge
and believe as he pleases, concerning what is here related: My
principal motive for publishing these Sheets, being the Persuasion of
some Friends, who had perused them in Manuscript, and thought they
might prove acceptable to the Publick._




INTRODUCTION.


That Part of _Africa_ commonly called _Guinea_, is of a large Extent,
beginning at _Cape Verd_, in 14 Degrees 30 Minutes North Latitude,
and extending to the South and East, as far as the Coast of _Angola_;
the River _Congo_, in 6 Degrees South Latitude, being the farthest
place where the _English_ carry on their Trade.

In this Country of _Guinea_, the _English_ have trafficked a great
many Years: But especially, since the Conclusion of the last _French_
War, it has been so improved, that whereas in the Year 1712, there
went only 33 Ships from _England_ to that Coast, in 1726, it was
proved before the _Commissioners of Trade_, that there had been there
the Year before above 200 Sail, to the great increase of Navigation,
and the advantage of our Plantations in _America_.

Such as are unacquainted with this Country, may reasonably suppose
we should have gained by this time a perfect account of the
Inland-Parts; yet perhaps we know the least of it of any Country
the _English_ have so long traded to, for reasons I shall give
hereafter. But as I design only to inform the Reader, (for his
better understanding the following Sheets) in a cursory manner, of
those parts of the Coast of _Guinea_, that I have been personally
acquainted with: So, as I go along, I shall intermix my Reasons with
the Account.

I have traded along this Coast for near 700 Leagues, from a River
called _Sherberow_, in the Latitude of 7 Degrees 30 Minutes North,
to _Cape Lopez Gonsalvez_, in 1 Degree South, near the Coast of
_Angola_: Now in so large an Extent, we meet with very different
People and Trade.

The first part I shall mention, is about 250 Leagues in length, from
the above-mentioned River of _Sherberow_, round _Cape Palmas_, to the
River _Ancober_ near _Axim_. This is commonly called the _Windward
Coast_, on which there is no Settlement or Factory of any _European_
Nation; but the Trade is carried on in this manner.

As soon as the Natives perceive a Ship on their Coast, they make
a smoke on the Sea-Shore, as a Signal for the Ship to come to an
Anchor, that they may come and trade with the People on board. As
soon as we are at an Anchor, they come to us in small Boats, called
_Cannoes_, being made of a single Tree, and bring their Commodities
with them.

Along the greatest part of this Coast, the _Europeans_ have been
cautious of venturing on Shore amongst the Natives, they being very
barbarous and uncivilized, as several have experienced to their
cost. In those few places where I have been on Shore my self, I
could never obtain a satisfactory account from the Natives of the
Inland Parts. Nor did I ever meet with a white Man that had been,
or durst venture himself, up in the Country; and believe, if any
had attempted it, the Natives would have destroyed them, out of a
Jealousy that they designed to make discoveries to their prejudice.

However, the Trade on this part of the Coast, has been exceedingly
improved within these 20 years past. It consists in Negroes,
Elephants Teeth, and other Commodities; which the Natives freely
bring on board our Ships, except when any Affront has been offered
them; which, to the great Scandal both of _English_ and _French_,
has too often been done, namely by their forcibly carrying away the
Traders, under some slight pretence of having received an Injury from
them. And this has put a stop to the Trade of the particular place
where it has happened for a long time; and innocent People, who
have come there to trade in small Vessels, have suffered for their
Countrymens Villany: Several in my time having been surprized by the
Natives, and the People destroyed out of revenge.

From the aforementioned River of _Ancober_ to _Acra_, is about 50
Leagues. This part is commonly called the _Gold-Coast_, and thereon
are many _English_ and _Dutch_ Factories, under each of which is a
_Negroe Town_, protected by them. The Reader may reasonably suppose,
that here we might have a perfect account of the Inland parts; but
we can have no such thing. For the Policy of the Natives does not
suffer white Men to go up any great way into the Country. Moreover,
the Inland People are very jealous of those Negroes, who are under
the Protection of the Factories; so that the account I have received
from both when at peace (which has brought some of the former to
the Sea side) has seemed so fabulous and contradictory, that it
could not be depended upon; for the Negroes are very apt to impose
on us. However, in this part called the _Gold Coast_, the Natives
near the Sea side are much civilized, by their conversing with the
_Europeans_, at their Settlements; and by going on board so many
Ships to trade, as frequent this part of the Coast. Here we can
venture on Shore amongst the Natives, without any hazard; for ’tis to
be noted, a large part of the Gold Coast is not in Subjection to them.

From _Acra_ (where stands the last of the _European_ Settlements,
on this part of the Coast,) to _Jaqueen_, is about 60 Leagues. In
this Tract there are no Factories but at two places, namely at
_Whidaw_, and _Jaqueen_. And tho’ they have been so long settled by
the _Europeans_, yet till the late Conquest of them by the King of
_Dahomè_, we could learn but little of the Inland parts; no white
Men having been permitted to go beyond the Kingdom of _Ardra_, which
is about 50 Miles from the Sea side. But, as I have related in the
following Sheets what I saw and heard when I was there; so I omit
farther mention of it here.

From _Jaqueen_ to the Bay of _Bennin_, and so round to the
_Callabars_, _Camerones_, and _Cape Lopez_, is above 300 Leagues, in
which long Tract there is no Settlement of any _European_ Nation;
so of course the Natives are for the most part barbarous and
uncivilized. I have, in my younger years, traded to many places in
this Tract, especially at _Old Callabar_, where, in the year 1704,
I saw a sad Instance of Barbarity. The King of the place, called
_Jabrue_, being fallen sick, he caused, by the advice of his Priests,
a young Child about ten Months old, to be sacrificed to his God, for
his recovery. I saw the Child after it was killed, hung up on the
Bough of a Tree, with a live Cock tied near it, as an addition to the
Ceremony.

The last Voyage I went to this place, was in the year 1713, when
I commanded the Ship _Anne_, belonging to Messieurs _Bradley_,
_Virginia_ Merchants; where I had the good fortune to save a
Child from being Sacrificed, as the other poor Infant had been.
And tho’ ’tis a long story, and therefore may not so well suit an
Introduction, yet on account of the singular Circumstances wherewith
it was attended, I believe the Reader may be pleased with it.

The chief King, or Lord of the Country (for there are several petty
Princes on that River) called _Acqua_, came on board, sometime after
my arrival, to see the Ship, and hear our Musick. Being highly
pleased with his Entertainment, he kindly invited me on Shore; so I
promised to wait on him in a few days. Accordingly I went; but as I
knew his People to be fierce brutish Cannibals, I took, by way of
precaution, ten of my Sailors as a Guard, with my Gunner to command
them. They were all well armed with Musquets and Pistols, which those
savage People I knew were much afraid of.

Upon my landing at the Water side, I was received by some persons,
whom the King had appointed to conduct me about a quarter of a mile
up, where I found him sitting on a Stool, under some shady Trees;
another being placed by his side, which I was desired to sit on. The
King did not speak one word, or moved in the least, till I was sat
down; but then he bid me welcome, enquiring after my health; as I did
after his, having first paid my respects to him, by bowing and taking
off my Hat. There were many of his Courtiers present, and I observed
above 50 of his Guard, stood at a little distance. They were armed
with Bows and Arrows, a Sword by their side, and a barbed Lance in
their Hands. My people ranged themselves opposite to them, at the
distance of about twenty paces.

After having presented the King with some things, which, tho’
trifling to us, he seemed highly delighted with; accidentally turning
my Head about, I saw a little Negroe-Child tied by the Leg to a
Stake driven in the Ground, the flies and other vermin crawling on
him, and two Priests standing by. Being surprized at this sight, I
asked the King, “What was the reason of the Child’s being tied in
that manner?” He replied, “It was to be sacrificed that night to
his God _Egbo_, for his prosperity.” Moved at the hearing of this,
I called (too hastily I must own) to one of my People, to take the
Child from the Ground, in order to preserve him. He had no sooner
done it, but one of the King’s Guard advanced towards him, in a
threatning posture with his Lance; and fearing he would run him
through, I immediately took out of my Pocket a small Pistol; at the
sight of which, the King rose from his Stool in a fright. But I
bid the Linguist tell him, “I would offer no Injury to him or his,
provided he ordered his Guard not to attack mine:” Which he readily
doing, and all things being quiet, I expostulated with him, “for his
breaking the Laws of Hospitality, in permitting one of his Guard
to threaten my Man with his Lance.” To this the King replied, “I
had not done well in ordering him to seize the Child, it being his
Property.” This I acknowledged, “excusing it on the account of my
Religion, which, tho’ it does not allow of forcibly taking away what
belongs to another, yet expresly forbids so horrid a Thing, as the
putting a poor innocent Child to death. And that this would, instead
of Blessings, certainly bring on him the Wrath of the most high God,
whom we white Men adored.” I also observed to him, “That the grand
Law of human Nature was, To do to others as we desir’d to be done
unto;” and many other Arguments I used, too long to repeat here. At
the same time I offered to pay him for the Child, which the King
readily accepted: And on my asking, what he desired for it? to my
surprize he only asked a bunch of sky coloured Beads, worth about
half a Crown Sterling. I expected he would have demanded at least ten
times that Value; for the Negroes, from the King to the Trader, are
generally very ready, on any extraordinary occasion, to make their
Advantage of us.

After this was over, I staid about an hour with the King, treating
him with _European_ Liquors and Victuals, which I had carried on
Shore for that purpose; but I took care not to drink any of his
Palm Wine, (which is a Liquor drawn from a Tree, and which they can
artfully poison) under pretence, it did not agree with me. But my
People did not spare it, drinking plentifully of it with his Guards;
and eating likewise heartily of their Victuals.

After this I took my leave, and the King expressed himself well
pleased with my Visit; promising to come on board again, before I
went out of the River.

As we were returning in our Boat, I told the Gunner, “That when we
came on board, he should pitch on some motherly Woman, to take care
of this poor Child.” To which he answered, “He had already one in
his Eye.”

It happened, the day before I went on Shore to see the King, I had
purchased the Mother of the Child (tho’ I knew it not then) from one
of his People; and at that time my Surgeon observing to me, she had
much Milk in her Breasts, I enquired of the Person that brought her
on board, whether she had a Child when he bought her from the Inland
Trader? To which he answered in the negative.

But now on my coming on board, no sooner was the Child handed into
the Ship, but this poor Woman espying it, run with great eagerness,
and snatched him out of the white Man’s Arms that held him. I think
there never was a more moving sight than on this occasion, between
the Mother and her little Son, (who was a fine Boy about 18 Months
old; for ’tis to be noted, the Negroe-Women generally suckle their
Children till they are above two years old) especially when the
Linguist told her, “I had saved her Child from being sacrificed.”
Having at that time above 300 Negroes on board my Ship, no sooner was
the Story known amongst them, but they expressed their Thankfulness
to me, by clapping their Hands, and singing a Song in my praise. This
affair proved of great service to us, for it gave them a good Notion
of white Men; so that we had no Mutiny in our Ship, during the whole
Voyage.

I went from the River of _Old Callebar_, to the Island of _Antegoa_,
where our Cargoe was sold; and upon my telling one Mr. _Studeley_
this remarkable story, he bought the Mother and her Son, and was a
kind Master to them.

I could give a farther account of some more extraordinary things,
that have happened in the many Voyages I have made to this Coast; but
am afraid of being tedious to the Reader: So I shall conclude with
observing, that Mynheer _Bosman’s Account of the Coast of_ Guinea,
is the most perfect History we have of that Country; and do readily
confess, that whatever he mentions, as far as my Observations have
reach’d, I have found to be true. To this Book therefore I refer the
Reader, who is curious to know, the _Manners_, _Customs_, _Trade_,
&c. of the _Negroes_ along the Sea-Coast.

                               BOOK I.

  _Containing an Account of the Destruction of the Kingdom of_
  Whidaw, _or_ Fida; _the Author’s Journey to the King of_
  Dahomè’_s Camp; with several other remarkable Particulars_.


For the better understanding of the following Relation, it is
necessary to prefix some Account of the late State of the Country of
_Whidaw_, before the terrible Destruction and Desolation thereof, in
the Month of _March 1726-7_.

[Sidenote: Description of _Whidaw_, _Sabee_.]

The Reader then is to observe, That the Sea-coast of this Kingdom
lies in 6 Degrees 40 Minutes North Latitude. _Sabee_, the chief Town
of the Country, is situate about seven Miles from the Sea side. In
this Town the King allowed the _Europeans_ convenient Houses for
their Factories; and by him we were protected in our Persons and
Goods, and, when our Business was finish’d, were permitted to go away
in Safety. The Road where Ships anchored, was a free Port for all
_European_ Nations trading to those Parts for _Negroes_. And this
Trade was so very considerable, that it is computed, while it was
in a flourishing State, there were above twenty thousand _Negroes_
yearly exported from thence, and the neighbouring Places, by the
_English_, _French_, _Dutch_, and _Portuguese_. As this was the
principal Part of all the _Guinea_ Coast for the Slave Trade, the
frequent Intercourse that Nation had for many Years carried on with
the white People (a) had rendered them so civilized, that it was a
Pleasure to deal with them.

  (a) So they call the _Europeans_, in Opposition to the _Negroes_.

The greatest Inconvenience we were exposed to, was the Thievery of
the common People, which it was hardly possible to guard intirely
against; so bold and dextrous were they at it: Tho’ if taken in the
Fact, they became our Slaves.

[Sidenote: Polygamy.]

The Custom of the Country allows Polygamy to an excessive degree;
it being usual for a great Man to have some hundreds of Wives and
Concubines, and meaner Men in proportion; whereby the Land was become
so stock’d with People, that the whole Country appeared full of Towns
and Villages: And being a very rich Soil, and well cultivated by the
Inhabitants, it looked like an intire Garden. Trade having likewise
flourished for a long time, had greatly enriched the People; which,
with the Fertility of their Country, had unhappily made them so
proud, effeminate, and luxurious, that tho’ they could have brought
at least one hundred thousand Men into the Field, yet so great were
their Fears, that they were driven out of their principal City, by
two hundred of their Enemies; and at last lost their whole Country,
to a Nation they formerly had contemned. And tho’ this may appear to
the Reader very incredible, yet it will sufficiently be illustrated
by the following Account.

[Sidenote: Account of the King of _Whidaw_.]

The King of _Whidaw_ came to the Crown when about fourteen Years
old, so that the Government was for many Years in the hands of the
great Men of the Country; who liked it so well, that tho’ he was past
thirty Years of Age when this Calamity happened, yet they had to this
time sought all ways to keep him from a Knowledge of governing. This
suited indeed with his Temper, for he was indolent and lascivious,
having in his Court several thousands of Women, by whom he was served
in all capacities; for no Men-servants were allowed to be there.
Being thus soften’d by his Pleasures, he grew intirely negligent
of his Affairs, which at last produced such a Weakness in the
Government, that it ended in its Ruin. For the great Men played the
petty Tyrants, often falling out, and pursuing their particular
Interests, without regarding the Good of their King or Country. By
this means the common People were divided, and such Parties arose
among them, as, added to their Fears, rendered them a Prey to their
Neighbours; so that tho’ they were able to have repelled any Force
which could have been brought against them by the neighbouring
Countries, they rather chose to abandon the Land, than join heartily
against the common Enemy; who brought at this time on them such a
terrible Desolation by the Sword, Fire and Famine, as hardly ever
befel any Country.

[Sidenote: The King of _Dahomè_’s Invasion.]

This common Enemy was the King of _Dahomè_, a far inland Prince, who
for some Years past had rendered himself famous, by many Victories
gained over his Neighbours. He sent an Ambassador to the King of
_Whidaw_, requesting to have an open Traffick to the Sea side,
and offering to pay him his usual Customs on _Negroes_ exported:
which being refused, he from that time resolved to resent it, when
Opportunity offered. This the King of _Whidaw_ was so far from
apprehending, that in an Audience I had of him, soon after the
Ambassador’s Departure, he told me; if the King of _Dahomè_ should
offer to invade him, he would not use him when taken according to
their Custom, that is, cut off his Head, but would keep him for a
Slave to do the vilest Offices.

[Sidenote: His Conquests.]

And here ’tis necessary to make a short Digression concerning the
King of _Dahomè_’s Conquests. Being a politick and couragious Prince,
he had such Success against his Neighbours, in a few Years, that he
conquered towards the Sea Coast, as far as the Kingdom of _Ardra_,
which is the next inland Country adjoining to _Whidaw_; and then
resolved to remain quiet for some time, in order to settle his
Conquests. But an Accident soon called him again to Arms, for the
King of _Ardra_ having much injured his own Brother, named _Hussar_;
the latter sent privately to the King of _Dahomè_, and offered him
a large Sum of Money to revenge him for the many Affronts he had
receiv’d from the King his Brother. This the politick Prince soon
listen’d to; and the King of _Ardra_ having discovered the Matter,
sent to the _Whidaws_, representing to them, it was their common
Interest to oppose this Conqueror; but they most imprudently refused
to lend him their Assistance. So being obliged to encounter alone
the King of _Dahomè_, he met him with all the Forces he could raise,
which was about fifty thousand Men of his own People, and after a
three Days Engagement, his Army was totally defeated, and himself
taken Prisoner. Soon after which he was beheaded in the Conqueror’s
Presence according to the barbarous Custom of these black Princes.

[Sidenote: _Bullfinch Lambe._]

There was at that time in the Country of _Ardra_ a white Gentleman,
named _Bullfinch Lambe_, who was detained Prisoner by the King on
this occasion: Having been sent by the Governour of the _African
Company_’s Settlement at _Jaqueen_, on some Business to the King of
_Ardra_, this Prince detained him, under pretence the Company owed
him for one hundred Slaves, formerly sent down to their Factory; and
he sent word to the Governour, if he did not forthwith pay him this
Debt, he would make Mr. _Lambe_ a Slave. Which the Governour refusing
to do, he remained a Prisoner about two Years, being used very hardly
’till he was taken in this War by the King of _Dahomè_: Being brought
into the King’s Presence (who had never before seen a white Man) he
was treated very kindly by his Majesty, and had, in a short time
after, a Houshold appointed for him with many Servants, and the King
bestowed on him some of his near Relations for Wives. Having remained
with this Prince near three Years, he was at his own earnest Desire,
dismiss’d with a noble Present of Gold and Slaves, in order to go for
_Europe_: And his Majesty by a Messenger, to the Towns and Villages
he passed through, in his way to _Jaqueen_ on the Sea side, ordered
the Inhabitants to shew him all possible Respect, and provide nobly
for his Entertainment.

[Sidenote: _Whidaw_ invaded.]

After this Gentleman’s Departure, the King of _Dahomè_ resolved to
invade the Country of _Whidaw_; which, as I have been told, Mr.
_Lambe_ had dissuaded him from; representing the great number of the
Inhabitants, who were much used to Fire-Arms. Moreover, that the
white People resident and trading there, would no doubt assist them
for their own Interest: So that there was no probability of Success.
But this politick Prince finding by his Spies, how much the great
Men and People were divided, and that the King was only a Cypher
in the Government; he marched against them. The first part of the
Country he invaded was the northernmost, of which a great Lord named
_Appragah_ was hereditary Governour, who forthwith sent to his King
for Assistance: But through the Interest of his Enemies at Court,
who wished his Destruction, he was refused: So having made a little
Resistance, he submitted to the King of _Dahomè_, who received him
very kindly.

The Conquest of _Appragah_ gave the King an easy Entrance into the
Heart of the Country; but he was obliged to halt there by a river,
which runs about half a Mile to the northward of the principal Town
of the _Whidaws_, called _Sabee_, the Residence of their King. Here
the King of _Dahomè_ encamped for some time, not imagining he could
have found so easy a Passage and Conquest as he met with afterwards.
For the Pass of the River was of that Nature, it might have been
defended against his whole Army, by five hundred resolute Men; but
instead of guarding it, these cowardly luxurious People, thinking
the fame of their numbers sufficient to deter the _Dahomes_ from
attempting it, kept no set Guard. They only went every Morning and
Evening to the River side, to _make Fetiche_ as they call it, that
is, to offer Sacrifice to their principal God, which was a particular
harmless _Snake_ they adored, and prayed to on this occasion, to keep
their Enemies from coming over the River.

[Sidenote: Snakes worshipped.]

And, as worshiping a Snake may seem very extravagant to such as are
unacquainted with the Religion of the _Negroes_, I shall inform
the Reader of the Reasons given for it by the People of _Whidaw_.
This sort of Snake is peculiar to their Country, being of a very
singular Make; for they are very big in the middle, rounding on the
Back like a Hog, but very small at the Head and Tail, which renders
their Motion very slow. Their Colour is yellow and white, with brown
Streaks; and so harmless, that if they are accidentally trode on
(for it is a capital Crime to do it wilfully) and they bite, no bad
Effect ensues; which is one Reason they give for their worshipping
of them. Moreover, there is a constant Tradition amongst them, that
whenever any Calamity threatens their Country, by imploring the
Snake’s Assistance, they are always delivered from it. However this
fell out formerly, it now stood them in no stead; neither were the
Snakes themselves spared after the Conquest. For they being in great
Numbers, and a kind of domestick Animals, the Conquerors found many
of them in the Houses, which they treated in this manner: They held
them up by the middle, and spoke to them in this manner: _If you are
Gods, speak and save your selves_: Which the poor Snakes not being
able to do, the _Dahomes_ cut their Heads off, ripped them open,
broiled them on the Coals, and eat them. It is very strange, the
Conquerors should so far contemn the Gods of this Country, since they
are so barbarous and savage themselves, as to offer human Sacrifices
whenever they gain a Victory over their Enemies; an Eye-Witness to
which I was, as hereafter shall be related.

But to return to the King of _Dahomè_. He was so politick as to send
to the _Europeans_, then residing at _Whidaw_, to assure them, if
they stood neuter, and were not found in Arms they should receive no
Damage in their Persons or Goods, in case he proved Conqueror; and
that he would ease their Trade, and remove divers Impositions laid
on it by the King of _Whidaw_: On the contrary, if they appeared
against him, they must expect his Resentment. But they were in a
Dilemma; for tho’ the King of _Whidaw_ did not desire otherwise, yet
they would gladly have retired from _Sabee_ to two mud-walled Forts,
belonging to the _English_ and _French African Companies_, which are
within three Miles of the Sea side. However, finding it would have
been resented by the King as a Discouragement to his People, they
were obliged to remain in the Town, never suspecting the Inhabitants
would have run away in the cowardly manner they did; or that they
should share the Fate of War with them.

The Pass of the River being, as I have related above, wholly left
to the Care of the Snakes, whom the Enemy little feared; and they
having observed for several Days, that the _Whidaws_ kept no set
Guard there, it encouraged the King of _Dahomè_’s General to send two
hundred of his Soldiers to ford the River: Which having done without
Opposition, and being bold Fellows, they marched towards the Town
of _Sabee_, sounding their musical Instruments. This was about three
a Clock in the Afternoon, and the Outguards of the Town were almost
all asleep; but being roused by the Noise of the Enemy’s Musick and
Shouts, they fled into the Town, reporting, that all the _Dahomè_
Army was got over the River: Which soon reaching the King’s Ear, he
immediately fled, with all his People, making no Resistance. I was
informed by the white People, then in the _English_ and _French_
Forts, that about five a Clock the same Afternoon, they saw such
Numbers of People flying from all Parts of the Country towards the
Sea side, that it was very surprizing: For the Fields were covered
with them many Miles round, and their black Colour made them the
more conspicuous in a clear sunshiny Day, on a fine flat champaign
Country. The King, with a great number of his Subjects fled to an
Island on the Sea Coast, which was parted from the main Land by a
River, having ferried over in Canoes; but a great many that could not
have the same Benefit, being hurried on by their Fears, were drowned
in the Rivers, in attempting to swim to the Islands lying near
_Popoe_; which was the next neighbouring Country to their own, on the
Sea Coast to the Westward; and where they might have been secure from
their Enemies, had they escaped. Moreover, many thousands of these
poor People that sheltered themselves up and down the Country among
the Bushes, perished afterwards by Sword and Famine.

But now to return to the _Dahomè_ Soldiers: When they first came to
_Sabee_, it seems they marched directly to the King’s Court, where
not finding him, they set it on Fire; and then sent their General
word of what had happened, who brought the whole Army over the River
that Evening. He was in such a Surprize at his good Fortune, that
he could hardly believe what he saw; and the white Gentlemen were
as much amazed, to see the great Cowardice of these People, who had
vapoured so highly, and as ignominiously quitted, the Town without
opposing their Enemies in the least, leaving them intirely in the
Power of the Conquerors, with all their own Riches. Mr. _Duport_, who
was then the _African Company_’s Governour, told me, that when the
_Dahomè_ Soldiers, who had never seen white Men before, came to his
House, they stood in amaze, and would not venture near him, till he
beckon’d and held out his Hand to them. Whereupon they laid hold on
him, and finding him a Man like themselves in all Respects, except
Colour, soon laid aside their Reverence; and taking from him what
he had valuable in his Pockets, made him Prisoner, with about forty
other white Men, _English_, _French_, _Dutch_ and _Portuguese_, who
were served in the same manner. Amongst them was _Jeremiah Tinker_
Esq; who had just before resigned the _African Company_’s Affairs to
Mr. _Duport_, and designed, if this Accident had not prevented him,
to have embarked in a few Days for _England_. But Segnor _Pereira_
the _Portuguese_ Governour, had the good Fortune to escape from
_Sabee_, to the _French_ Fort. He told me, he was in great fear of
being smothered in the Press of the flying People, whom he could
hardly keep off with his Dagger, from the Hammock he was carried in
on Mens Shoulders. The Day after the taking of the Town of _Sabee_,
the white Men taken Prisoners, were sent into the Country to the King
of _Dahomè_, who lay then encamped with another Army, about forty
Miles off in the Kingdom of _Ardra_; some Hammocks being provided for
the principal white People amongst them, which is the usual way of
travelling in this Country for Gentlemen either white or black.

Mr. _Duport_ further told me, that as soon as they came into the
Camp, they were separated according to their Nations, being delivered
to, and put under the Care of, several principal black Gentlemen. At
first they were badly accommodated; for it was some Days before he
could obtain an Audience of the King; which when he did, he greatly
complained of the Usage he had met with in all Respects. On this his
Majesty said, “He was very sorry for what had happen’d, for he had
given Orders to his Captains, in case they met with Success, to use
the white Men well; but he hoped they would excuse what had befallen
them, which was to be attributed to the Fate of War: Confessing, he
was much surprized when he was first informed, so many white People
were made Prisoners, and soon after brought to his Camp. That in the
Confusion of Things he had not regarded them so much as he ought; but
for the future, they should have better Treatment.” Which accordingly
they found; but could never recover any thing taken from them, that
being put on the score of the Fate of War. However, a few Days after,
they were set at Liberty without any Ransom, and sent down to the
_English_ and _French_ Forts. The principal Gentlemen amongst them
were presented with Slaves, and his Majesty assured them, as soon as
he had settled his Conquest, he would make Trade flourish, and have a
particular Regard to their Interests.

The latter end of _March_, in the Year 1726-7, I arrived with the
_Katharine Galley_ in the Road of _Whidaw_, where I landed, and went
to the _English_ Fort, which is about three Miles from the Sea side,
and likewise to the _French_ Fort near adjoining. The white People
that had been taken Prisoners, being returned to those Places but a
few Days before, gave me a full account of the great Calamity fallen
on the Country, about three Weeks before my Arrival; which gave
me much Concern, I having traded there several Voyages. It was a
lamentable Story to hear, and a dismal Sight to see, the Desolation
of so fine a Country, lately exceeding populous, now destroyed in
such a manner by Fire and Sword. The Carnage of the Inhabitants was,
above all, a most moving Spectacle, the Fields being strewed with
their Bones. Moreover the Concern for the Interest of my Voyage
affected me not a little. But knowing it highly necessary to keep
up my Spirits in so hot a Country, I resolved (humbly relying on
Providence) not to be wanting in my Endeavours, for the Interest I
had under my Care; and I met with far greater Success than any way I
could have reasonably expected, considering the melancholy Prospect I
had then of Affairs, which shall be related hereafter.

Having stayed three Days on Shore with the _English_ and _French_,
who, I found, were in as great a Doubt as my self how to act in
their Affairs; I came to a Resolution to go for the Port or Road
of _Jaqueen_, which lies about seven Leagues to the Eastward of
_Whidaw_; and has about thirty Miles of Sea-Coast. This Place has
always been the Sea Port to the Kingdom of _Ardra_, and tributary to
it; having a hereditary Governour, who paid his Tribute in Loaves of
Salt, there being great Quantities made here.

As soon as the King of _Dahomè_ had conquered _Ardra_, the Lord of
this Place sent his Submission, offering the usual Tribute he used
to pay the conquered King; which was readily accepted. This shews
the Policy of the King of _Dahomè_; for tho’ he had made a terrible
Destruction of the Inhabitants of the inland Countries he had
conquered from Time to Time; yet he knew his Interest too well, to
destroy the People of this Country in the same manner; for having
now obtained his Desires, in gaining a free Passage to the Sea-Side,
he judged the _Jaqueens_ would be very useful to him, because they
understood Trade, and now by their means, he should never want a
supply of Arms and Gunpowder, to carry on his designed Conquests.
Moreover these People had ever been Rivals to the _Whidaws_ in Trade,
and had an inveterate Hatred against them, because they had drawn
almost the whole trade from the _Jaqueens_, to their own Country.
For, the Pleasantness thereof, with the good Government in former
Times, had induced the _Europeans_ to carry on the far greater part
of the Trade, at their principal Town of _Sabee_.

It was on the third of _April_ 1727, we anchored in the Road of
_Jaqueen_; and soon after I sent on Shore my Surgeon, to the Lord
of that Place, to settle an Agreement with him, before I landed my
self; for I had never been at this Place, and had a Hint given me not
to trust him, before all the Particulars I demanded were agreed to
by him; for he had formerly plaid base Tricks with some _Europeans_,
who had not taken such a Precaution. In the Evening my Surgeon
sent me a Letter, informing me, he had obtained all I desired;
For the Performance of which the Lord of the Place had taken his
_Fetiche_ or Oath, in presence of a _French_ and _Dutch_ Gentleman:
On this Assurance I landed the next Day, and went up to the Town of
_Jaqueen_, which lies about three Miles from the Sea side, where I
was received very kindly, the Promises and Agreement made with my
Surgeon being renewed, and a House appointed me to keep Factory in.

[Sidenote: The Author’s Journey to the King of _Dahomè_’s Camp.]

The next Day a Messenger came from the King of _Dahomè_, whose Name
was _Buttenoe_. He spoke very good _English_, and told me, “His
Majesty having heard there was an _English_ Ship arrived in the Road
of _Whidaw_, he had ordered him to go there and invite the Captain
to come up to his Camp; (which was about forty Miles directly within
the Land in the Country of _Ardra_) but being told there I was gone
for _Jaqueen_, he had followed me to make the King’s Desire known to
me: Assuring me in his Majesty’s Name, I should be intirely safe in
all Respects, and kindly used.”

To this I answered, “I would consider his Majesty’s kind Invitation,
and he should know my Resolution next Day.” But perceiving I had
some Distrust in my Mind, he represented to me, “That if I did not
go, it would highly offend the King; that he feared I should not be
permitted to trade, besides other bad Consequences might follow.”
This black Messenger, as mentioned above, spoke very good _English_,
having learnt it when a Boy in the _English_ Factory at _Whidaw_: He
belonged to Mr. _Lambe_, and was with him at the time he was taken
Prisoner by the King of _Ardra_. They both fell into the King of
_Dahomè_’s Power, as related above, where he learnt the Country
Language; and in this respect I had as capable an Interpreter as I
could desire. So, upon considering the matter, finding the Interest
of my Voyage depended on my going to the Camp to wait on the King, I
resolved to undertake it, tho’ the many Barbarities I had been told
his People had been guilty of, gave me some Concern. However, soon
after, I had further Encouragement, by others offering to accompany
me. For a _Dutch_ Captain’s Curiosity prompted him to it, whose Ship
had been destroyed just before by the _Portuguese_: Moreover the
_Dutch_ chief Factor proposed to send one of his Writers with large
Presents to the Conqueror; likewise the Lord of _Jaqueen_ offered to
send his own Brother, to pay his Duty, with great Presents to the
King; not having done it before. So having prepared all Things for
our Journey, which took us up three Days, we set out in the following
manner.

The eighth of _April_, at nine a Clock in the Morning, being
accompanied with the aforesaid Persons, we went to the Side of the
River that runs on the Back part of the Town of _Jaqueen_, having
in our Retinue One hundred black Servants. We ferried over the
River in _Canoes_, which are a sort of Boats, made of large Trees
hollowed. The People of the Town attended us in great numbers to the
water side, praying for our success: For they were under terrible
apprehensions for our safety, amongst such barbarous People as we
were going to: Especially they were highly concerned for the Duke,
their Lord’s Brother, who was a Person endowed with the most amiable
qualities I ever met with amongst Persons of his Colour.

Being landed on the other side of the River, we set out on our
Journey, the proper servants of each person attending in their
several places. I had six Hammock-men, who relieved one another by
turns; two at a time being only required to carry the Pole which
it is fastened to. I had likewise a small Horse to ride on, when
I was weary with lying in the Hammock. The other Gentlemen were
accommodated in the same manner. Our travelling was at the rate
of about four miles an hour; for we made frequent Stops for our
Baggage-carriers, there being no Carts nor good Horses at _Jaqueen_;
the few Horses that are there being but little bigger than our Asses.
The Country, as we travelled along, appeared beautiful and pleasant,
and the Roads good; but desolated by the War, for we saw the remains
of abundance of Towns and Villages, with a great quantity of the late
Inhabitants bones strewed about the Fields.

Noon time being past, we dined under some Cocoe-trees, on the cold
Provision we carried with us; and in the Evening being come to a few
sorry Hovels, we put up there for the night, and lay on the ground on
mats, (the huts not being big enough to hang our hammocks up in) and
the greatest part of our Attendants were obliged to lye in the open
Air.

The next day about seven a clock in the morning, we set out again,
and by nine came within half a mile of the King’s Camp. Here we
halted, and judge we had then travelled about forty miles from
_Jaqueen_. Soon after a Messenger came from his Majesty to compliment
and welcome us; and being told it was proper to prepare our selves,
we took our best apparel out of our trunks, and dress’d our selves
under the covert of an old wall; and soon after we advanced within
a little way of the Camp, where we were desired to wait for a great
Man who was to receive us. The King, it seems, to do us the more
honour, sent the principal person of his Court (whom the _Negroes_
distinguish’d to us by the Title of the _Great Captain_) to receive
us; which he did in a very extraordinary manner. For he came in the
midst of five hundred Soldiers, who had Fire-arms, drawn Swords,
Shields, and Banners in their hands, using so many odd and ridiculous
Ceremonies, (as they appeared to us) that at first we could not
judge, whether they meant us well or ill: For the Great Captain,
with some of his Officers, approached us, with their Swords drawn,
flourishing them over our heads, then pointing them to our Breasts,
and skipping and jumping about us, like so many monkies, showing as
many tricks and postures, as that animal generally does. At last,
after some time spent in this manner, the Great Man settled into a
sedate temper; Then he gave us his hand, welcoming us in the King’s
Name, and drank to us in Palm Wine, which is a Juice drawn from the
Palm-tree, which is very common in that Country. We returned the
Compliment, drinking the King’s health both in Wine and Beer we had
brought with us, which he seemed to be well pleased with: and all
Ceremonies being ended, he desired us to go with him towards the
Camp; and accordingly we proceeded, the Soldiers guarding us, and the
musical Instruments making a dismal noise.

In about half an hour’s time we arrived at the Camp, which was near
a very great ruin’d Town, late the principal place of the Kingdom
of _Ardra_. Here the Army lay in tents, which, according to the
_Negroe_-Custom, were made of small Boughs of Trees, and covered
with Thatch, very much resembling Bee-hives, but each big enough to
hold ten or twelve Soldiers, who crept in at a hole on one side,
and lay heads and points together. Upon our entring the Camp, we
were conducted to some large Trees, where Chairs, (taken from the
_Whidaws_,) were brought for us to sit on, under the Shade of the
Trees. Immediately such Numbers of People flock’d about us, that if
the Officers had not ordered the Soldiers to keep the Multitude off,
we should have been in danger of being smothered. For tho’ there
had been forty white men taken at _Whidaw_, who were all brought
up prisoners to this Camp, and afterwards released, as related
above, yet thousands of people, who came since out of the far inland
Countries, had never seen a white man before us.

Having rested our selves about two hours, under the Shade of the
Trees, and beheld divers Feats of Activity, performed by the Soldiers
to divert us, we were conducted to a thatch’d House, that had been
prepared for us; and tho’ we were obliged to stoop at our going in at
the Door, yet there was height enough within to hang our Hammocks up
to sleep in, which was no little Satisfaction to us, for our Bones
were hardly recovered, from the former night’s Lodging on the Ground.
After we had stowed our Baggage in the Tent, the great Man took his
leave of us, but left a Guard to prevent any of the People from
disturbing us, and he went to the King to give his Majesty an Account
of our Arrival.

By this time Noon was come, so we set down to dinner on cold Ham and
Fowls, which we had brought with us. Our Tent stood in the middle of
a large Court palisadoed round. We were surprized, that no People
came into the place to see us, they having crouded so much at first,
on our coming into the Camp: But I was told the King having been
inform’d how we were incommoded, had given strict Orders, no one, on
pain of Death, should, without leave of the Captain of our Guard,
come to see us. This was pleasing news; for by this we found his
Majesty was duly obeyed, and also had our safety at heart. But we
were plagued with a Vermin that greatly annoyed us; and that was such
an infinite number of Flies, that tho’ we had several Servants with
Flappers, to keep them off our Victuals, yet it was hardly possible
to put a bit of Meat into our Mouths, without some of those Vermin
with it. These Flies, it seems, were bred by a great number of dead
Mens Heads, which were piled on Stages, not far from our Tent, tho’
we did not know so much at that time.

After we had dined, a Messenger came to us, about three o’ clock
in the afternoon, from the _Great Captain_, desiring us to go to
the King’s Gate; accordingly we went, and in our way saw two large
Stages, on which were heaped a great number of dead Men’s Heads,
that afforded no pleasing sight or smell. Our Interpreter told us,
they were the Heads of four thousand of the _Whidaws_, who had been
sacrificed by the _Dahomes_ to their God, about three weeks before,
as an Acknowledgment of the great Conquest they had obtain’d.

When we came to the King’s Gate, as they call’d it, we found it only
an Entrance into a large Court, which was palisadoed round; there
being several mud-wall’d Houses in it. Here we were desired to sit
down on Stools brought to us; and an Officer presented us, in the
King’s name, with Cows, Sheep, Goats, and other Provision; with this
Compliment, that as his Majesty was then in a Camp, it was not in
his power to provide for us better at this time. Having returned
thanks for this unexpected favour, we went out of the Court, and
were surprized with a sight, at the Gate, of forty stout Men ranked
in file, with Fusees on their Shoulders, and broad Swords in their
Hands; who had about their necks strings of dead Mens Teeth, reaching
as low as their middle, both behind and before, in such Quantities,
as might furnish all the Barber-Surgeons Shops in _Europe_. Being
surprized at this extraordinary appearance, I asked the Linguist,
Why they were drest in this manner? To which he replied, They were
the King’s _Heroes_, or _Worthies_, who had killed a great many
People with their own hands, and were allowed, as a mark of their
great Valour, to string and wear their Enemies Teeth about their
Necks; and, I might observe, some of them had been more successful
than others, by the different quantities they had on: For that it
was made death by their Law, for any of those Gentlemen to string a
Tooth, without first making due Proof, before the proper Officers,
that it belonged to an Enemy slain with their own hand in Battle.
Having viewed this strange Sight, I bid the Linguist tell them, “They
appeared to be a Company of brave Gentlemen, and that I was their
humble Servant.” This Compliment pleased them, and they returned it,
saying, “They had a great Esteem for white Men.”

After this was pass’d, we returned to our Tent, and supped; then hung
up our Hammocks, and lay in them till Morning. I took notice, that
the Lord of _Jaqueen_’s Brother, who came from thence with us, was
entertained at the Tent of the _Great Captain_; and on my inquiring
the reason, I was answered, It was in respect to us, that we might
not be crouded in our Tent.

Next Morning, at nine a Clock, an Officer came from the King to
acquaint us, we should have an Audience forthwith. Accordingly we
prepared our selves; and then going to the King’s Gate, were soon
after introduced into his Presence. His Majesty was in a large Court
palisadoed round, sitting (contrary to the Custom of the Country)
on a fine gilt Chair, which he had taken from the King of _Whidaw_.
There were held over his Head, by Women, three large Umbrellas, to
shade him from the Sun: And four other Women stood behind the Chair
of State, with Fusils on their Shoulders. I observed, the Women were
finely dress’d from the middle downward, (the Custom of the Country
being not to cover the Body upward, of either Sex) moreover they had
on their Arms, many large Manelloes, or Rings of Gold of great Value,
and round their Necks, and in their Hair, abundance of their Country
Jewels, which are a sort of Beads of divers Colours, brought from a
far inland Country, where they are dug out of the Earth, and in the
same Esteem with the _Negroes_, as Diamonds amongst the _Europeans_.

The King had a Gown on, flowered with Gold, which reached as low as
his Ancles; an _European_ embroidered Hat on his Head; with Sandals
on his Feet. We being brought within ten Yards of the Chair of State,
were desired to stand still: The King then ordered the Linguist to
bid us welcome; on which we paid his Majesty the respect of our
Hats, bowing our Heads at the same time very low, as the Interpreter
directed us. Then I ordered the Linguist to acquaint the King, “That
on his Majesty’s sending, to desire me to come up to his Camp, I
forthwith resolved on the Journey; that I might have the pleasure of
seeing so great and good a King, as I heard he was; relying intirely
on the Promises his Messenger had made me in his Majesty’s Name.”
The King seemed well pleased with what I said, and assured us of
his Protection and kind usage. Then Chairs being brought, we were
desired to sit down, and the King drank our Healths; and then Liquor
being brought us by his Order, we drank his Majesty’s. After this the
Interpreter told us, “It was the King’s Desire we should stay some
time with him, to see the Method of paying the Soldiers for Captives
taken in War, and the Heads of the slain.”

It so happen’d, that in the Evening of the Day we came into the Camp,
there were brought above eighteen hundred Captives, from a Country
called _Tuffoe_, at the distance of six days Journey. The occasion
of warring on them, the Linguist thus related, “That at the time
his King was wholly employed in contriving the Destruction of the
_Whidaws_, these People had presumed to attack five hundred of his
Soldiers, sent by his Majesty as a Guard to twelve of his Wives, who
were going with a large quantity of Goods and fine things, carried
by Slaves, to the Country of _Dahomè_. The Guard being routed, and
the Women slain, the _Tuffoes_ possess’d themselves of the Goods; for
which Outrage, as soon as the Conquest of _Whidaw_ was compleated,
the King sent part of his Army against them, to revenge him for their
Villany; in which they had all desirable Success.” It was necessary
to mention this Affair, for the better understanding of what follows,
it being so very remarkable.

The King, at the time we were present, ordered the Captives of
_Tuffoe_ to be brought into the Court: Which being accordingly done,
he chose himself a great number out of them, to be sacrificed to his
_Fetiche_ or Guardian Angel; the others being kept for Slaves for
his own use; or to be sold to the _Europeans_. There were proper
Officers, who received the Captives from the Soldiers hands, and
paid them the Value of twenty Shillings Sterling for every Man, in
_Cowries_, (which is a Shell brought from the _East Indies_, and
carried in large quantities to _Whidaw_ by the _Europeans_, being the
current Money of all the neighbouring Countries far and near) and
ten Shillings for a Woman, Boy, or Girl. There were likewise brought
by the Soldiers some thousands of dead Peoples Heads into the Court;
every Soldier, as he had Success, bringing in his hand one, two,
three, or more Heads hanging in a String; and as the proper Officers
received them, they paid the Soldiers _five Shillings_ for each
Head: Then several People carried them away, in order to be thrown
on a great Heap of other Heads, that lay near the Camp; the Linguist
telling us his Majesty designs to build a Monument with them, and the
Heads of other Enemies formerly conquered and killed.

I observed, there were a great many of the principal Men of the Court
and Army present, all prostrated on the Ground; none being permitted
to go nearer, than within twenty foot of the King’s Chair; and
whatsoever they had to say to his Majesty, first kissing the Ground,
they whispered into the Ear of an old Woman, who went to the King;
and having received his answer, she returned with it to them. His
Majesty likewise showed his Liberality to his Courtiers and Officers,
in presenting them with at least two hundred Captives. As soon as
any person had a Slave presented to them, a proper Officer made
Proclamation of it, which was immediately echoed by the Populace, who
were waiting in great numbers at the King’s Gate for the Sacrifices.

After the Business of the Captives was dispatch’d, there came into
the Court two Fellows, with a large Tub, that had in it at least
six Gallons of Frumenty, or such like stuff, which they set on the
Ground; and then falling on their Knees, they took with their Hands
the Victuals out of the Tub, and threw it so fast into their Mouths,
that tho’ there was such a quantity of it, they dispatch’d it in a
few Minutes. The Linguist told us, this was their daily Practice; but
that these Gormandizers lived not many Years, and then others took up
their Trade; which is only in order to divert the King.

After this we saw several other things, full as ridiculous as this,
which would be tedious for me to relate, as well as to the Reader
to peruse; so having been near three Hours in the Court, exposed to
the great heat of the Sun, from which we had nothing but Umbrellas
to defend us, we desired his Majesty’s Leave, to retire to our
Tent, which was readily granted; accordingly we paid our Duty in a
compliment to the King, and went away.

Sometime after this, we sat down to Dinner in our Tent, being
accompanied with a great number of Flies, as formerly mentioned. Just
as we had dined, the Duke, Brother to the Lord of _Jaqueen_, came to
us in so great a fright, that after he had sat down, he could not
speak for some time: And tho’ he was at other times, of a comely
black colour, yet now his Countenance was changed to tawny: For as he
was coming to our Tent, he saw a great number of poor People going
to be sacrificed; whose Lamentations had made such an Impression,
that it had occasioned this great disorder in him. For the People of
the Sea-Coast abhor such things; especially the eating their Bodies
afterwards, as the _Dahomes_ do. And ’tis not to be imagined, what
service the report of this did them, when they first invaded the
Countries bordering on the Sea-Coast: On which I shall make a short
Digression, to inform the Reader.

Discoursing afterwards with some of the principal People of _Ardra_
and _Whidaw_, who had escaped the Conqueror’s Sword, and telling
them, what a Reproach and Disgrace it was to the latter Nation to
quit their Country to the _Dahomes_ in so cowardly a manner as
they had done; they answered, It was not possible to resist such
_Cannibals_, the very Report of which had extremely intimidated
their whole Nation. Whereupon I observed to them, It was all one to
a dead Carcase, whether it was eaten by their own kind, or by the
Vultures, (of which there are great numbers in the Country) on which
they shrugged up their Shoulders, saying, “The thoughts of being
eaten by their own Species, were far more terrible to them, than the
Apprehensions of being killed.”

[Sidenote: _Human Sacrifices._]

But to return again to the Duke, I endeavoured to allay his Fears,
by representing to him, we had the King’s Promise for our Safety;
and that sacrificing their Enemies being the usual custom of the
Country on any Conquest, he ought not to be so much surprized at
it. But he replied, As to his own Safety he was very doubtful of
it, the King not having yet admitted him to an Audience; so he
requested he might remain in our Tent, as thinking himself safer
with us, and accordingly we granted his request. Then sending for
our Linguist, we desired to know, Whether the _Dutch_ Captain and my
self might be admitted to see the manner of the Sacrifices: (As for
the _Dutch_ Writer, he chose to remain in the Tent with the Duke).
The Interpreter answered, He would go to the chief _Feticheer_, or
Priest, and know, whether he would be pleased to give us leave. Soon
after he returned, and informed us, Leave was granted: So we went
with him, about a quarter of a mile from the Camp. There we found
great numbers of People gathered together; and our Guard made way for
us through the Croud, till we came near four small Stages, which were
erected about five foot from the ground. We stood close to them, and
observed the Ceremony, which was performed in the following manner.

The first Victim we saw, was brought to the side of the Stage. It
was a comely old Man, between fifty and sixty Years of Age. His
hands were tied behind him; and in his behaviour, he showed a brave
and undaunted Mind, nothing like Fear appearing in him. As he stood
upright by the Stage, a _Feticheer_, or Priest, laid his Hand on his
Head, saying some words of Consecration, which lasted about two
Minutes. Then he gave the sign of Execution, to a Man that stood
behind the Victim with a broad Sword, who immediately struck him on
the nape of the Neck, with such force, that the Head was severed at
one Blow, from the Body; whereupon the Rabble gave a great Shout.
The Head was cast on the Stage, and the Body, after having lain a
little while on the Ground, that the Blood might drain from it, was
carried away by Slaves, and thrown in a place adjoining to the Camp.
The Linguist told us, the Head of the Victim was for the King; the
Blood for the _Fetiche_, or God; and the Body for the common People.
We saw many other Persons sacrificed in this lamentable manner, and
observed, That the Men went to the side of the Stages, bold and
unconcerned; but the Cries of the poor Women and Children were very
moving, and much affected the _Dutch_ Captain and My self, tho’ in a
different manner: For he expressed his Fears to me, That the Priests
might take it into their Heads, to serve us in the same manner, if
they should fancy white People would be more acceptable to their
God, than persons of their own colour. This notion raised some fear
in me, but recollecting my self, I told him, “As the King was so
greatly reverenced and feared, I was in good hopes nothing would be
attempted on us; and that we ought to put a good face on the matter,
and withdraw from so terrible a Sight, the first opportunity.” Soon
after, a principal Man of the Court came and stood by us, and bid the
Interpreter ask us, “How we liked the Sight?” To which we replied,
“Not at all: For our God had expressly forbid us using Mankind in so
cruel a manner: That our Curiosity had drawn us to come and see it;
which if we had not done, we could never have believed it.” Then I
asked the Linguist, Whether this Gentleman was accounted a generous
good humoured Man? To which the Linguist replying in the affirmative,
I ventured to put this Question to him, “That if his Fate had brought
him into the same Misfortune, as these poor Captives were now in,
how he should like it? He readily answered, Not at all. On this I
observed to him, that the grand Law both of Whites and Blacks, with
all their Fellow Creatures was: _To do to others no otherwise, than
as they desired to be done unto_: And that our God had enjoined this
to us on pain of very severe Punishments.” To which he answered, This
was the Custom of his Country; and so he left us.

Presently after this Gentleman’s departure, there came to us a
Colonel of the Army, whom we had seen at _Jaqueen_, the day before
we set out on our Journey. This person seemed very friendly and glad
to see us, and ready to resolve any Questions we put to him. Amongst
the rest, I told him, “That I wondered they should sacrifice so many
People, of whom they might otherwise make good advantage, by selling
them.” He replied, “It had ever been the Custom of their Nation,
after any Conquest, to offer to their God a certain number of
Captives, which were always chose out from among the Prisoners, by
the King himself: For they firmly believed, should this be omitted,
no more Success would attend them. And he argued for the Necessity
and Usefulness of their doing it, from the large Conquests they had
made within a few Years, without any Defeat.” Then I asked him, “Why
so many old Men were sacrificed in particular? He answered, It was
best to put them to death; for being grown wise by their Age and
long Experience, if they were preserved, they would be ever plotting
against their Masters, and so disturb the Country; for they never
would be easy under Slavery, having been the chief Men in their own
Land. Moreover, if they should be spared, no _European_ would buy
them, on account of their Age.” I then observed to him, That I had
seen several and some young People sacrificed, whom was sure the
_Europeans_ would gladly have bought. He replied, “They were designed
to attend in the other World the King’s Wives, whom the _Tuffoes_
their Countrymen had slain.” By which Answer I found they have a
Notion of a future State, tho’ a very rude one. And this put me upon
asking him, What Opinions they held concerning their God? To which
he gave a very confused and imperfect Answer; so that all I could
gather from his Discourse was, That they esteemed him as an invisible
Guardian Angel, subordinate to another God; adding, “Perhaps that
God might be ours, who had communicated so many extraordinary Things
to white Men; as he had been informed by Mr. _Lambe_: But as that
God had not been pleased to make himself known to them, they must be
satisfied with this they worshipped.”

By this time the Mob being grown thin, on the side where we stood,
I told the Linguist, we would return to our Tent; and I invited the
Colonel to go along with us, which he readily promised. Accordingly
our Guard having made way for us, we left this horrible Place and
Sight, not having received the least Affront, tho’ we were near two
Hours by the Stages.

At our return we understood, the King had sent the Duke word, he
should have an Audience that Evening; whereupon I endeavoured to
cheer him up by telling him, “That we had been civilly used at the
Sacrifices, and that nothing could more conduce to his Reputation,
than his appearing before the King, in his usual sprightly Carriage
and Behaviour,” which was indeed natural to him. On this he went from
us to the Great Captain’s Tent, in order to prepare himself to go to
the Audience. But the Colonel remained with us, drinking merrily of
_European_ Liquors, and in the Evening he asked us, “Whether we would
take a walk, and see that Quarter of the Camp where his Tent stood?”
This we readily agreed to, and in our way past by the place where the
sacrificed Bodies were thrown. There were two great heaps of them,
consisting, as they said, of four hundred Persons, and who had been
chose out by the King that very Morning.

After we had been at the Colonel’s Tent, where we were treated with
Palm Wine, we returned to our own, being accompanied by him, and we
desired him to stay to Supper. While we were eating, several Servants
came with Dishes of Flesh and Fish, dress’d after the Country manner,
and the Interpreter told us, they were sent by a Mulatto _Portuguese_
Gentleman, who had been taken in the _Ardra_ War. The King had ever
since detained him Prisoner, allowing him a handsome Maintenance, and
had given him a Wife much whiter than himself, who was born in the
inland Country. Soon after the Victuals were brought, the Gentleman
came himself, with his Wife, to see us; and after passing a handsome
Compliment, they sat down to Supper with us. We were very glad of
this new Acquaintance, the _Dutch Writer_ speaking good _Portuguese_,
and my self understanding a little; so that now we judged, we should
not be obliged to trust intirely to our Linguist, this Person
talking the Language of the Country fluently. I was much surprized
to see his Wife so white, equal to our _English_ Women, only of not
so lively a Colour. She had woolly Hair, like the blackest of the
Natives, with the same Features. Her Husband told us, she was born in
a far inland Country, of black Parents, who had never seen a white
Man, nor she before Mr. _Lambe_; whom he enquired affectionately
after, saying, “That when he returned, according to his Promise to
the King, his Majesty had promised to grant him his Liberty.” Then,
on his Importunity, we promised him a Visit at his House; and soon
after, he and his Wife, with the Colonel, took their leaves, wishing
us a good Night.

[Sidenote: _Cannibals._]

The next day, early in the morning, the Duke came to our Tent, and
told us, he had, in the night past, a long Audience of the King, who
treated him in a kind manner; so that his Apprehensions of being
kill’d and eaten were quite vanished: but he told us with the utmost
Horrour, that the sacrificed Bodies had been taken away in the night
by the common People, who had boiled and feasted on them, as holy
Food. This Story induced us to send for our Linguist, and take a walk
to the place where we had seen the Carcases the evening before; and,
to our great Surprize, we found they were all gone. Thereupon asking
the Interpreter, what was become of them? he replied smiling, the
Vultures had eaten them up. I told him, “That was very extraordinary
indeed, to swallow Bones and all;” there being nothing remaining
on the Place, but a great quantity of Blood. So he confessed, the
_Feticheers_, or Priests, had divided the Carcases amongst the
People, who had eat them in the manner the Duke had told us. And tho’
no doubt this will appear incredible to many Persons, yet I desire
they will only make this one Reflection, That those who could be so
cruel as to sacrifice their fellow-Creatures, might probably carry
their Barbarity a Degree further.

However, as I relate nothing for matter of Fact, but what I was an
Eye-witness to, so I shall leave the Reader to give what credit
he pleases thereto. But as a further confirmation of their being
Cannibals, I shall relate what I afterwards learn’d from one Mr.
_Robert More_, who was a person of great Integrity, and at that time
Surgeon of the _Italian Galley_. This Ship came to _Whidaw_ whilst
I was at _Jaqueen_, and Captain _John Dagge_, the Commander, being
indisposed, sent _More_ to the King of _Dahomè_’s Camp, with Presents
for his Majesty. There he saw many strange things, especially human
Flesh sold publickly in the great Market-place. As I was not in the
Market during the time I was in the Camp, I saw no such thing: But
I don’t doubt but that I should have seen the same, had I gone into
that place, for there were many old and maimed Captives brought from
_Tuffoe_, (besides those sacrificed) which no _Europeans_ would have
bought.

But to return from this Digression: On our return to the Tent, we
sent our Linguist to the great Captain, to desire he would procure
us an Audience from the King, to treat of Business: But he sent us
word, That as his Majesty was very much engaged, we could not be
heard that day; there being some Embassadors come from the inland
Countries, who were to have an Audience forthwith. On this I sent
again to the Great Captain, desiring he would please to be mindful
of us, on the first Opportunity; and he was unexpectedly so that
Afternoon.

Having then nothing to do but sit in our Tent, and make Memorandums
of what we heard and saw; we asked the Linguist, “Whether we might,
without Offence, go to see the Mulatto _Portuguese_ Gentleman?”
Thereupon he consulted with a principal Person belonging to the
Court, who often came by the King’s Order to us, to enquire if we
wanted any thing; And he approving of it, we prepared to go, but
first had this Caution given us; that there being two Embassadors
in the Camp from the King of _Whidaw_, to offer his Subjection, if
we should meet with any of their People in the Street, we should
not hold any Conference with them. Which having promised, we went
to the _Portuguese_ Gentleman’s House, who received us very kindly,
thinking he could not make us welcome enough; and as we could
understand him, we sent our Interpreter away, under pretence of an
Errand to the Duke. After he was gone, the first thing we desired of
this Gentleman, was, to give us some hints, how we should behave,
when we came to treat of Business with the King; which he readily
did, speaking so highly of the King’s Policy and Generosity, that
we were much surprized, tho’ afterwards we experienced the full of
what he told us. This Person had in the Court of his House two pretty
Horses, each about thirteen hands high, which were every way much
better than those we had seen at _Jaqueen_. Upon our asking him,
from whence he had them, he replied, “They came from the Kingdom of
_J-oe_; which lies towards the North-East, many days Journey off,
beyond a great and famous Lake, which is the Fountain of several
large Rivers, that empty themselves into the Bay of _Guinea_. And
he further added, that several fugitive Princes, whose Fathers the
King of _Dahomè_ had conquered and beheaded, fled to the King of
this Country for Protection, and at last prevailed with him to make
War on the King of _Dahomè_, which he did soon after the latter had
conquered _Ardra_. The King of _J-oe_ sent, under the Command of a
General, a great Army of Horse, consisting of many Thousands, (for
they never use Infantry) wherewith he invaded the _Dahomes_ in their
own Country: On this sudden and unexpected Invasion, the King of
_Dahomè_ marched immediately from _Ardra_ into his own Kingdom, and
made Head against the _J-oes_. But as he had none but Infantry, whose
Arms were Guns and Swords, he was hard put to it: For the Country
being open and without Inclosures, the Horsemen, who were armed
with Bows and Arrows, Javelins and cutting Swords, had certainly
conquer’d, if the unusual noise of the _Dahomè_’s Fire-Arms had
not so frightned the Horses, that their Riders could never make a
home-Charge on the Enemies Foot. However, the Dispute having lasted,
at times, four days, and the King of _Dahomè_ finding his Soldiers so
fatigued, that they could hold out but a little longer, he contrived
this Stratagem: he had great quantities of Brandy by him, formerly
bought at _Whidaw_, which is a principal Commodity the _French_ Ships
bring there, to exchange for Negroes. So the King resolved to retreat
in the Night with his Army, and leave the Liquor as a Bait for the
Enemy, with great quantities of valuable Goods, which were in store,
in a large Town near the Camp. When Day came, the _J-oes_ thinking
the _Dahomes_ were fled, fell to plundering and destroying the Town,
and drinking greedily of the Brandy: And as they seldom had tasted
of that Liquor before, it so intoxicated them, that they fell asleep
in great numbers on the Ground. The King of _Dahomè_ being informed
of this by his Spies, returned with the utmost speed, and attacking
them while they were in this Disorder, routed them; but the greater
part of the _J-oes_ escaped with the help of their Horses, and fled
out of the Country: However, their Loss was so great, that the others
esteemed it a compleat Victory. The _Portuguese_ Gentleman added,
that at the time of this Rout, he took the two Horses we had seen in
his Yard, and a great many more were seized at the same time by the
_Dahomè_ Soldiers. He said further, (but enjoined us Secrecy) That
tho’ the _Dahomes_ were exceeding proud of this Victory, they were
still much afraid of a second Invasion, an Army of Horses being very
terrible to them: And that the King had lately sent great Presents
to the King of _J-oe_, to prevent his attacking him a second time.
However, in case he did it, and they should not be able to withstand
them, they comforted themselves with this Thought, that they might
save their Persons, by flying to the Sea Coast, to which the _J-oes_
durst not follow them. For as their national _Fetiche_ was the Sea,
they were prohibited by their Priests from ever seeing it, under no
less a Penalty than Death; which they made the People believe, would
by their God, if they were so presumptuous, be inflicted on them.”
This last Story seemed nothing strange to us, who had conversed with
the Coast _Negroes_; for they have all their particular _Fetiches_
after the same manner; some being prohibited eating Fowls that have
white Feathers; others, on the contrary, are to eat none that have
black: Some are to eat no Sheep, others no Goats. And abundance
of such other superstitious Observances they have, which are most
religiously kept, being assigned them by the Priest, the Day they
have their name given them.

By this time it was past Noon, so we took our leave of the
_Portuguese_, and went to our Tent to Dinner.

[Sidenote: The Author has an Audience of the King of _Dahomè_.]

About three a Clock that Afternoon, a Messenger came from the great
Captain, to inform us, the King had appointed immediately to give
us an Audience. This was an agreeable Surprize to us, for now we had
hopes of being quickly dispatch’d, so we prepared our selves, and
went to the King’s Gate, our Presents for his Majesty being carried
before us.

On our coming into the Court, where we had seen the King at our
former Audience, we were desired to stay a little, till the Presents
were carried into the House, that his Majesty might view them. Soon
after we were introduced into a small Court, at the further end
of which the King was sitting cross-legg’d on a Carpet of Silk,
spread on the Ground: He was himself richly dress’d, and had but few
Attendants. When we approached him, his Majesty enquired in a very
kind manner, How we did? ordering we should be placed near him; and
accordingly fine Mats were spread on the Ground for us to sit on.
Tho’ sitting in that Posture was not very easy to us, yet we put a
good Face on the matter, understanding by the Linguist, that it was
their Custom.

As soon as we were placed, the King ordered the Interpreter to ask
me, What I had to desire of him? To which I answered, “That as my
Business was to trade, so I relied on his Majesty’s Goodness, to
give me a quick dispatch, and fill my Ship with _Negroes_; by which
means I should return into my own Country in a short time; where
I should make known how great and powerful a King I had seen.” To
this the King replied by the Linguist, “That my desire should be
fulfilled: But the first Business to be settled was his Customs.”
Thereupon I desired his Majesty to let me know what he expected?
There was a Person then present (I believe on purpose) whose name
was _Zunglar_, a cunning Fellow, who had formerly been the King’s
Agent for several Years at _Whidaw_; where I had seen him in my
former Voyages. To him I was referred to talk about the Affair. So
_Zunglar_ told me, “his Master being resolved to encourage Trade,
tho’ he was a Conqueror, yet he would not impose a greater Custom
than used to be paid to the King of _Whidaw_.” I answered, “As his
Majesty was a far greater Prince, so I hoped he would not take so
much.” This _Zunglar_ not replying readily to, and the King observing
it, (for the Linguist told him every word that pass’d between us)
His Majesty himself replied, “That as he was the greater Prince,
he might reasonably expect the more Custom; but as I was the first
_English_ Captain he had seen, he would treat me as a young Wife or
Bride, who must be denied nothing at first.” Being surprized at this
turn of Expression, I told the Linguist, “I was afraid he imposed on
me, and interpreted the King’s words in too favourable a manner.” His
Majesty observing I spoke with some Sharpness, asked him what I said?
Which the Linguist having told him, his Majesty smiled, and expressed
himself again to the same purpose: Adding, “I should find his Actions
answerable to his Words.” Being greatly encouraged by the King’s
gracious Expressions towards me, I took the Liberty to represent to
his Majesty, “That the best way to make Trade flourish, was to impose
easy Customs, and to protect us from the Thievery of the Natives, and
the Impositions of great Men; which the King of _Whidaw_ not doing,
had greatly hurt the Trade. For the ill usage the _Europeans_ had met
with of late from him and his People, had caused them to send fewer
Ships than formerly they did. And tho’ a large Custom might seem at
first for his Majesty’s Advantage, yet it would soon be found, that a
great number of Ships would thereby be hindred from coming to trade;
so that in this respect he would lose far more in General, than he
would gain by that Particular.”

The King took what I said in good part, telling me, “I should name
my own Custom,” which I at first declined: But being prest to do
it a second time, I told the Linguist to ask his Majesty, “Whether
he would be pleased to take one half of what we used to pay at
_Whidaw_?” To this the King readily agreed; adding, “He designed to
make Trade flourish; and I might depend upon it, he would prevent
all Impositions, and Thievery, and protect the _Europeans_ that came
to his Country, saying, that his God had made him the Instrument to
punish the King of _Whidaw_, and his People, for the many Villanies
they had been guilty of towards both Whites and Blacks: That the
Embassadors now in his Camp from the said King, had informed him of
me and my Character, and that by the account they had given him of
my former dealings in their Country, he could put much Confidence in
me.” Then his Majesty having asked me divers Questions concerning our
former ill usage in the Country of _Whidaw_, to which I answered as
I thought proper; I took this Opportunity of pleading for the common
People of that Kingdom; representing, “It was the great Men amongst
them that had encouraged their thieving, in which they shared: But if
his Majesty would be pleased to receive them to Mercy, and restore
them to their Country, on paying a certain Tribute, they would be
of great advantage to him; because they were very industrious in
cultivating the Land, and many of them understood Trade exceeding
well, which his own People were little versed in. Moreover it was a
Maxim amongst the white Princes, that the number of useful Subjects
was their greatest Glory and Strength; and if his Majesty thought
the same, he had an opportunity of adding many hundreds of thousands
to his former Vassals.” To this the King replied, “He was sensible
of the truth of what I alledged, but that the Conquest of _Whidaw_
could not be secured, till he had the King’s Head; and he had already
offered the People to restore them to their Country, as soon as they
should send him alive or dead to his Camp.” I did not think proper,
on hearing this, to say any thing more on the matter, or observe to
his Majesty, how wrong a Policy it was, to oblige Subjects to act so
villanous a part towards their Sovereign. For as the Custom of these
black Princes was little known to us, I was afraid of giving offence:
So I only answered, “That as the King of _Whidaw_ was on an Island
by _Popoe_, with many thousands of his People, the rest that were
dispersed up and down the Country in the Bushes, could not possibly
perform what his Majesty required of them: For if they were ever so
ready to do it, yet having no Cannoes to ferry over to the Island,
it was not in their Power to take the King from thence; and that I
believed if he did not receive them to Mercy quickly, the far greater
part of them would perish by Famine.”

[Sidenote: Account of _Bullfinch Lambe_.]

After this his Majesty fell into a variety of Discourse, and amongst
other things complained of Mr. _Lambe_, (who, as I have related in
the beginning of this Book, had been taken Prisoner in the _Ardra_
War,) saying, “That tho’ he had given him, at his leaving the Court,
three hundred and twenty ounces of Gold, with eighty Slaves, and
made him promise with a solemn Oath to return again in a reasonable
time, yet twelve Moons had now pass’d, and he had heard nothing from
him: Adding, He had sent a black Person with him, whose name was
_Tom_, one who had been made a Prisoner at the same time, being a
_Jaqueen-man_, who spoke good _English_; and this Man he had ordered
to return again with Mr. _Lambe_, that he might be informed, whether
what that Gentleman had reported concerning our King, Customs,
and manner of Living was true.” To this I replied, “That I had no
personal Knowledge of Mr. _Lambe_, but had been informed, before I
left _England_, that he went from _Whidaw_ to _Barbadoes_, which is a
Plantation where the _English_ employ their Slaves in making Sugar,
and which is at a great distance from our own Country; But I hoped he
would prove an honest Man, and return again to his Majesty, according
to his Promise and Oath.”

To this the King replied, “Tho’ he proved not as good as his Word,
other white Men should not fare the worse on that account; for as
to what he had given _Lambe_, he valued it not a Rush; but if he
returned quickly, and came with never so large a Ship, she should be
instantly filled with Slaves, with which he might do what he thought
proper.”

[Sidenote: Account of the black Man.]

It may not be improper here to give a short account of the _black
Man_ the King mentioned to me, because he was in _England_ last year,
and the Affair was brought before the Lords of Trade, by whom I was
examined about him.

Mr. _Lambe_ carried this Person to _Barbadoes_, and several other
Places, but at last left him with a Gentleman in _Maryland_.
Afterwards Mr. _Lambe_ trafficked for some Years, from one place to
another in the _Plantations_; and coming to the Island of _Antegoa_,
where I had been in the year 1728, and told the foregoing story to
some Gentlemen, and how kindly the King of _Dahomè_ had express’d
himself with regard to the said Mr. _Lambe_, being by them informed
of it, this induced him to return to _Maryland_; and the Gentleman
who had _Tom_ in his Custody was so good, as to deliver him again to
Mr. _Lambe_, who came with him to _London_, the beginning of the year
1731.

Mr. _Lambe_, soon after his arrival, came to see me at my house,
enquiring particularly about what I had related at _Antegoa_; which I
confirmed to him. Then he desired my Advice about his going back to
the King of _Dahomè_. To this I frankly answered, “It was my opinion,
he had miss’d the opportunity, by not returning in a reasonable
time, according to his promise; several years being now pass’d since
he came from thence, and the State of Affairs much altered for the
worse: Besides, he might justly fear the King’s resentment, as Mr.
_Testefole_ had experienced lately to his cost, for abusing his
Goodness; for tho’ he was Governour for the _African_ Company at
_Whidaw_, yet he had been put to death in a cruel manner.”

On this he left me; and the next news I heard, was, That Mr. _Lambe_
had delivered a Letter to his Majesty King George as from the King of
_Dahomè_, which being referred to the Lords of Trade, the Merchants
trading to the Coast of _Guinea_ were sent for; and I being ordered
to attend, informed their Lordships of what I knew of the matter.

The report from the Lords of Trade was to this Purpose, “That the
Letter in their opinion was not genuine, but that the _black Man_
ought to be taken care of, and returned to his King:” Accordingly he
was put into the hands of the _African_ Company, who took care of him
for many Months; but he growing impatient, applied to their Graces
the Dukes of _Richmond_ and _Montague_, who procured him a Passage on
board his Majesty’s Ship the _Tiger_ Captain _Berkeley_, then bound
to the Coast of _Guinea_.

Moreover, their Lordships having shewed him great Kindness, most
generously sent by him several rare Presents to his King, which, no
doubt, will make a good impression on him in favour of our Nation;
and I have lately heard, that on his being put on Shore at _Whidaw_,
he was forthwith sent to the King, who was then in his own Country
of _Dahomè_, and was received graciously by him: That his Majesty
sent down handsome Presents for Captain _Berkeley_, but before the
Messengers got to _Whidaw_, he was sailed, not having patience to
wait so many days, as the return from so far inland a place required.

I had not made this Digression, but only to set this Affair in a
true light; and undeceive those that may read this Book, and were
so far imposed upon, as to suppose the _Black Man_ to have been an
Embassador from the King of _Dahomè_, to his Majesty King _George_.
I met with several that believed so, till I satisfied them of the
contrary; for the jest was carried on so far, that several Plays were
acted on his Account, and it was advertised in the News-Papers, that
they were for the Entertainment of Prince _Adomo Oroonoko Tomo, &c._
these jingling Names being invented to carry on the Fraud the better.

This black Person was born at _Jaqueen_, and being from a Boy
conversant with the English trading there, learned so well our
Language, that he was employed by them, when grown up, as an
Interpreter.

He happen’d to be at _Ardra_ on some business, at the time that
Country was conquered, and so became Prisoner to the King of
_Dahomè_. But ’tis time to have done with this Story, and go on where
I left off.

After this Discourse concerning Mr. _Lambe_ was over, I acquainted
the King, that I daily expected another Ship belonging to my
Owner, (who had five large Ships that used the _Whidaw_ Trade in
particular) and I hoped his Majesty would not take more Custom from
the Commanders of them, than he had been pleased to take of me. To
which he answered with a Smile, “That it was a particular Grace to my
self. However when any of them came, they should be used kindly in
that matter, and the Captains might stay at _Jaqueen_ and _Whidaw_
as they thought fit, for that he now was Lord of both places.” And
then his Majesty asked me, “Whether I would chuse the Slaves that
were now in the Camp, or have them first sent down to _Jaqueen_?”
To which I answered, “I chose the latter; desiring the King would
now please to fix the Price, with other matters.” Accordingly
_Zunglar_ was called again, to inform his Majesty, what were the
last Prices the _Europeans_ had paid for Negroes at _Whidaw_, before
the Conquest: But on my representing, That the Price had been raised
there, much above what had been customary, on account of the War; the
King moderated it himself, and I writ down with my Pencil, in his
presence, every thing agreed on: Amongst which one was, That I should
have three Males to one Female, and take none but what I liked. The
reason of my mentioning this, is to explain more fully what happened
to me afterwards, on account of these two Articles.

After this was done, the Duke, Brother to the Lord of _Jaqueen_,
was sent for, and the King recommended me to the care of them both,
declaring, “If I suffered by their People, either in Person or Goods,
he and his Brother should answer for it: Moreover, if any Person
stole my Goods, and could be taken, his Majesty ordered, they should
be impaled alive on the Sea side, for an Example to the Porters, and
others that bring our Merchandise from thence to the Town.”

By this time it was near nine a clock at night, and the Linguist was
ordered by the King to tell us, his time of washing was come; so we
rose up in order to take our leaves, humbly thanking his Majesty for
all his Favours, and for his great Goodness towards us, in giving
us so long an Audience; desiring he would be pleased to permit us
to return next day to _Jaqueen_: adding, I hoped God would give him
many Days, for the good of his own People, and of the _Europeans_
that should come to his Country. The King thanked us for our good
Wishes, saying, he would dispatch us the next day, and then we paid
our Respects, and so parted.

As we were almost five hours so near the King, I had a good
opportunity of taking an exact View of him. He was middle-sized, and
full bodied; and, as near as I could judge, about forty five years
old: His Face was pitted with the Small Pox; nevertheless, there was
something in his Countenance very taking, and withal majestick. Upon
the whole, I found him the most extraordinary Man of his Colour,
that I had ever conversed with, having seen nothing in him that
appeared barbarous, except the sacrificing of his Enemies; which the
_Portuguese_ Gentleman told me, he believed was done out of Policy;
neither did he eat human Flesh himself.

Being made easy in all respects by this Audience, we returned to our
Tent, and spent the evening cheerfully, the _Mulatto Portuguese_,
with several Courtiers supping with us. The next morning we were
sent for again to the King’s Gate, and the Officers told us, “It
being the King’s _Fetiche_-day, his Majesty could not see us; but
that he had ordered them to present us with something in his name;
adding, I might depend on what had been promised me, and that we were
at Liberty to go for _Jaqueen_ when we pleased:” Our black Servants
had likewise handsom Clothes given them to wear about their middle;
(according to the custom of the Negroes, who never cover more than
that part) with a small sum of Money to each of them, which made them
very jocund, and almost forget the fear they had been put in at the
sight of the Sacrifices.

This being over, our servants carried the Presents to our Tent, which
consisted of Slaves, Cows, Goats and Sheep, with other Provisions:
And then we went to the great Captain’s Tent, to take our leave of
him. There we found the Duke, who told us, he could not have his
Audience of leave from the King till the Evening; and earnestly
desired us not to go without him; for that he would certainly
accompany us the next Morning to _Jaqueen_. Tho’ the _Dutch_
Gentlemen and my self were very desirous of going before, yet we
could not in honour leave the Duke; so we consented to stay for him,
and went to our Tent to Dinner.

In the Afternoon, the Linguist came and told us, that the remainder
of the Army, who had been plundering the Country of _Tuffoe_, were
returning; and asked us, whether we would go and see them pass by
the King’s Gate? We went accordingly to that place, and soon after
they appeared, marching in a much more regular Order than I had ever
seen before, even amongst the _Gold Coast Negroes_; who were always
esteemed amongst the _Europeans_ that used the Coast of _Guinea_,
the best Soldiers of all the Blacks. I observed, this Army consisted
of about three thousand regular Troops, attended by a Rabble of ten
thousand at least, who carried Baggage, Provisions, dead Peoples
Heads, _&c._ The several Companies of Soldiers had their proper
Colours, and Officers, being armed with Musquets and cutting Swords;
and with Shields. As they passed by the King’s Gate, every Soldier
prostrated himself, and kissed the Ground; then rose with such
agility, as was very surprizing. The place before the King’s Gate
was four times as large as _Tower Hill_; there they performed their
Exercises, in the sight of innumerable Spectators, and fired at least
twenty rounds with their small Arms, in less than two hours time:
Then, by the General’s Order, the Soldiers retired to the part of the
Camp they belonged to. This sight was well worth seeing even by us
_Europeans_.

I took notice, that abundance of Boys followed the Soldiers, and
carried their Shields; and asked the Linguist, “What was the occasion
of it?” He told me, “That the King allowed every common Soldier a Boy
at the publick charge, in order to be trained up in Hardships from
their Youth; and that the greatest part of the present Army consisted
of Soldiers, bred up in this manner, and under this Establishment.”
By which I judged, it was no wonder the King had made so large
Conquests, with such regular Troops, and his Policy together.

After this Sight was over, we went again to the great Captain’s,
whose eldest Son had been General in the Expedition against the
_Tuffoes_. The _Mulatto Portuguese_ Gentleman being then present,
advised us to go and pay our Compliments to this Commander.
Accordingly we went, and were received by him with great Civility;
and having presented him with some Trifles, wherewith he was highly
delighted, we returned to his Father’s Tent. After a short stay,
telling him we were afraid we should not set out for _Jaqueen_ the
next day, he assured us we should certainly go the next morning
early; and that he would accompany us part of the way: which Promise
was highly pleasing to us, for we were quite tired of the Camp:
Moreover my Business very much required my presence at _Jaqueen_,
in order to begin trading. I observed in the Great Captain’s Tent
two black Gentlemen, who had long Gowns on, with a Cloth wreathed
about their Heads, like a _Turkish_ Turbant, and Sandals on their
Feet. This being a Dress I had never seen before amongst the Negroes,
I inquired of the Linguist, who they were? He replied, “They were
_Malayes_, which is a Nation far inland, bordering on the _Moors_;
and that these People were equal to the white Men in one thing,
namely in writing: That at this time there was about forty of them in
the Camp, who had been taken at several times in war, as they traded
from one Country to another: and that the King treated them kindly,
for they had the Art of dying Goat and Sheep-skins with divers
Colours, which they made into Cartouch-boxes for the Soldiers; and
also into Bags to hold loose powder, and for many other uses.” I was
desirous of discoursing with these People, but the Linguist declined
it, saying, “It would give offence to the Great Captain:” So we went
from hence to take our leave of the _Mulatto Portuguese_ Gentleman,
and afterwards to our Tent to supper, and slept all night in our
Hammocks.

[Sidenote: The Author’s return to _Jaqueen_.]

Next Morning we rose early, and prepared for our Journey. As soon as
all our things were in order, we sent the Duke word, that we waited
for him. The Messenger returned forthwith, and desired us to go to
the great Captain’s Tent, where we should find the Duke and his
People all ready for going. Accordingly we went, but the Ceremony
of taking leave of several great Men, who came to wish us a good
Journey, detained us till nine a clock in the Morning: And then we
set out; the musical Instruments of the _Negroes_ making a great
noise at our Departure. The great Captain, according to his Promise,
accompanied us for an hour on the Road, and then took his leave
under a Salute of Fire-Arms from his Soldiers, and our Servants. Our
Hammock-men had no need of being press’d to make haste, and travel
fast: For the Impression made on their Minds by the sacrificing the
poor People of _Tuffoe_, still so much affected them, that they
ran full speed with us, even beyond their Strength; so that by
five a clock in the Evening, they brought us into _Jaqueen_ Town,
where the People received us with much Joy, having been under great
apprehensions for our Safety, because we stayed longer than was
expected.

The next day, being the 15th of _April_ 1727, I paid the King of
_Dahomè_’s Officers the Custom agreed on; and in two days after, a
great many Slaves came to Town, being sent by his Majesty for me to
chuse such as I liked of them: Which having done, I offered to pay
the Lord of _Jaqueen_ his usual Duties, but he insisted on a larger
Custom than my Surgeon had agreed for with him at our first coming:
So I refused to pay it, and put him in mind of the Injunction the
King of _Dahomè_ had sent him by his Brother. This put him in a
Passion, and he asked me sternly, Whether I designed to bring War
on him, by informing the Conqueror of what he demanded? This being
a tender Point, and hoping Time and Patience might bring him to do
me Justice, I took my leave of him: For I had been told, it was not
possible, no more than prudent, to engage any one to go with a
Complaint to the King of _Dahomè_; for the Messenger would certainly
be murdered on the Road by the _Jaqueens_. Moreover, I was informed,
they and their Lord had sent their beloved Wives and best Effects to
an Island, which is about thirty Miles to the Eastward of _Jaqueen_
on the Sea-Coast, and under the Protection of the King of _Appah_,
whose Country extends as far as the Bay of _Bennin_. And as they
durst not trust intirely to the Conqueror’s Faith and Promises, so
the Men were always ready to fly there themselves, on the least
appearance of Hostility: There they could be in safety, the _Dahomes_
not having Cannoes to follow them, or if they had, none amongst them
understanding the Management of them.

A few days after the Lord of _Jaqueen_ had refused to take his usual
Customs, another difficulty arose; for the Porters refused to bring
up my Goods from the Sea side, except I would pay them double the
price I did at my first coming. Thereupon I sent my Complaint to
their Lord, who acknowledged it was a great Imposition, but he sent
me word, “It was not in his Power to oblige those sort of People to
do me Justice; for by the stranding of the _Dutch_ Ship, they had
got so many Goods, that it had made them rich and proud; and should
he go about to force them to bring up my Goods at the usual rates,
they would forthwith quit the Country, and fly to _Appah_.” Being in
these melancholy Circumstances, imposed on by all hands, and without
hopes of redress, an accident relieved me very unexpectedly. For a
few days after this, the Lord of the place sent for me; and going to
him, he told me, “He had just then received Advice, that an _English_
Ship was arrived in the Road of _Whidaw_; and he desired I would
send my Boat there, to persuade the Captain to come to _Jaqueen_.” I
answered, “I did not doubt but that Ship was the _Italian_ Galley,
Captain _Dagge_, who was known to him; for I had expected him some
time, his Ship belonging to the same Gentleman as mine did: But
since I had received such bad usage from him and his People, he could
not expect I would be so imprudent as to advise the Captain, who was
in the same Interest with me, to come and receive the like Treatment:
Adding, If I sent my Boat, it should be to desire Captain _Dagge_ to
stay at _Whidaw_, and send a Messenger to the King of _Dahomè_, to
represent the usage I had met with from him; tho’, to let him see how
loth I was to give any Offence that way, I should intirely forget
what was past, if he would make me easy.” This immediately brought
him to do me Justice: He took his usual Custom that very day, and
the following went himself to the Sea side, to the Towns where the
Porters lived, and persuaded them to carry my Goods at the usual
rates.

Soon after this I received a Letter from Captain _Dagge_, desiring I
would let him know how Affairs flood at _Jaqueen_. Having informed
him of all matters, he concluded, it would be for our Owner’s
Interest if he stayed at _Whidaw_, where he had great Success; for
that People being in a starving Condition, and obliged to sell their
Servants and Children for Money and Goods, to buy Food from their
Neighbours of _Popoe_; his Ship was soon filled with _Negroes_, and
he had the good fortune to sail from the Coast three days before
me. Not long after the Arrival of Captain _Dagge_, I was taken ill
of a Fever; my Surgeon, a very eminent Man for Trade as well as his
Profession, died in a few days after my being taken ill; and the
rainy Season coming on, my white People both on board and on Shore
grew sickly; and to add to my Misfortunes, the King of _Dahomè_’s
Traders began to grow troublesome and imposing. Indeed I had one
Comfort in this Distress; namely, that tho’ I was two days together
without a white Man in the Factory with me, (occasioned by the
Sickness) yet I had nothing stole from me, which I believe was owing
to the severe Charge given by the King to the Lord of _Jaqueen_ and
his Brother, to take care of me and my Goods. But as to the King of
_Dahomè_’s Traders, when I objected to them my Agreement with their
Master, producing the Writing I had made in his Presence, and calling
the Linguist to witness, that I was not to take any Slaves but such
as I liked; yet it signified nothing: For tho’ the Interpreter
was so honest as to own it, yet he was as imposing as any other,
pretending the King’s Orders for what they did. Nay, I began at last
not to think my self safe, one of the Traders being so insolent as
to present his Fusil at me, for refusing to take his bad Slaves.
For tho’ they came to trade, yet they were always armed with Sword
and Dagger, and a Boy carried their Gun for them. These People were
far different from the Traders we used to deal with at _Whidaw_:
For these came always in a modest manner to deal with us, and tho’
sometimes I owed them Goods on my Notes for ten days together,
because the badness of the Sea prevented our landing them; yet they
shewed no Uneasiness about it: Whereas, on the contrary, these
_Dahomè_ Traders would come ten times a day with their Notes; tho’
they were sensible the Sea was so great on the Shore, that we could
land no Goods. And when I expostulated with them, about the needless
trouble they gave me and themselves, in coming so often to me to read
their Notes; it not being in my Power to pay them, ’till I could get
goods landed; they angrily replied, “They did not like a bit of Paper
for their Slaves, because the writing might vanish from it; or else
the Notes might be lost, and then they should lose their Payment.”
Upon that I used to shew them my Book, telling them their Notes were
entered therein, and should they lose them by any Accident, yet I
would pay them by my Book: And as to the writing it would never go
off the Paper; but this did no ways satisfy them.

About this time several _Portuguese_ Ships arrived in the Road of
_Whidaw_ and stay’d there, on a prospect of the Country’s being
settled again; for the King of _Dahomè_ had permitted a great number
of the common People to return, and they began to build them Houses
near the _English_ and _French_ Forts. But some time after it
appeared, that it was only done to deceive the _Europeans_. However
the King of _Dahomè_ being desirous of the _Portuguese_ Gold, which
they bring to purchase _Negroes_ with, his Majesty sent a great many
Slaves down to _Whidaw_, which made Trade dull with us at _Jaqueen_.
For tho’ formerly great Numbers came to this place, from other
Nations now destroyed by the _Dahomes_, there remains at present
only one Country called _Lucamee_, lying towards the North-East, for
_Jaqueens_ to trade to. Which Nation, by means of a wide River, has
escaped being made a Conquest to the barbarous and cruel _Dahomes_.
As I was in this melancholy state, one day, my old Acquaintance the
Captain (who had been so civil to me at the Camp) came to visit me;
and the Linguist not being in the way, I made use of a little black
Boy, who spoke pretty good _English_, and was entertained by me in
the Factory as a Servant, to be my Interpreter; ordering him to tell
the Captain my Grievances, for which he seemed concerned. He told me
he was a warlike Person, and so had no Knowledge of the Affairs of
the Traders; but he was confident the _Jaqueens_ were not tolerated
in such things by the King. Then I bid the little Boy further inform
him, That the Traders very much imposed upon the military Gentlemen
of his Country, in selling them Muskets bought out of the _French_
Factory, for the sake of a small Present. These being made in
imitation of _English_ Arms, were sent to the King, as if bought from
me, by which means a bad repute was brought on our Arms; because the
_French_ Guns split in firing, and hurt the Soldiers; which is owing
to their not being proved as ours are, with a good load of Gunpowder,
before they are put into a Stock and finished. I observed, this
very much moved him, so I made him a Present of some things, with a
promise of a greater Reward, if he would go to the King, and let his
Majesty know my Complaints. So having considered the matter a little
while, he agreed to go, charging the little Boy to keep the thing
secret, on pain of being put to cruel Torments if he divulged it; and
I soon after experienced the good Effects of his Journey.

The People of _Jaqueen_, as I mentioned before, were in very uneasy
Circumstances. The King of _Dahomè_ being informed of it, resolved to
send the great Captain to their Lord, to settle all things to their
Satisfaction. The Captain my Friend being got to the Camp before the
Great Captain set out, and acquainting the King with my Complaints,
it much incensed him against the Traders, and he caused the great
Captain to go forthwith to _Jaqueen_, to settle all matters. He made
such haste, that he brought the first news of his coming himself; and
because he had a great Retinue, on the first report of his arrival,
the Inhabitants of _Jaqueen_ were going to fly to _Appah_; believing
he was come in a hostile manner: But he soon made them easy, ordering
the far greater part of his People to remain on the other side of
the River, which runs on the back part of the Town; and he came only
with one hundred Attendants into the place. Upon the first notice
of his coming, the Duke, Brother to the Lord of _Jaqueen_, went to
receive him; and all the white Gentlemen in the Town, both Merchants
and Commanders of Ships, assembled at the Door of the _Dutch_
Factory, to salute him as he pass’d by that House. He was conducted
to the Duke’s Court, with all the Honours the place could possibly
afford. His Retinue was lodged near my Factory, which proved a great
disturbance to me; for they made a dismal noise with their musical
Instruments, both night and day; but on my complaining of it, they
were afterwards removed.

It seems the Great Captain, at his first coming into the Town, had
given orders to some of his Officers, to seize all the _Dahomè_
Traders. But by means of some Friend they had in their Retinue,
notice was given them; whereupon several of them fled. However, about
ten were seized, and immediately sent in Irons to the King: And the
Duke, brother to the Lord of _Jaqueen_, told me afterwards, “That
when the Great Captain began to talk of Business with him, the first
Question he asked, was, Whether the Traders had used me ill? To which
he replied in the affirmative; Adding, He was in my Factory, when
one of them presented his Piece at me, because I refused to buy the
bad Slaves brought by him.” The great Captain upon that asked him,
“Why he suffered me to be so used?” To which the Duke answered, “That
not only he himself, but his Brother, had been treated by them with
great Insolence; and that they were afraid to resent it, for fear
they should represent their Actions in a bad Light to the King.” On
this account the Great Captain said, they had talked enough upon that
Point.

We understood afterwards, that this great Man, at his return to the
King, acquainting him with the Misbehaviour of the Traders, his
Majesty ordered the Person who presented his Piece at me, to be
beheaded, with another, who had highly insulted me at the same time:
And the others were kept in bonds, fed only with Bread and Water;
and whenever it rained, they were put out into the Prison Court, and
exposed till it had done raining. By this I found, that the Traders
and the Linguist had shamefully belied the King; however, in Prudence
I did not think fit to complain of the Interpreter, but only chid him
in private; at which he was so frighted, that he left me, when the
great Captain returned to their King.

The next day after this Great Man’s arrival, all the white Gentlemen
in the place went to wait on him at the Duke’s House, carrying
him Presents; and I went amongst the rest. Upon my taking leave,
I invited him to dine with me at my Factory the next day. He came
accordingly with many Attendants, one of whom he admitted with the
Duke, to sit at Table with us. He seemed to be much pleased with
the Victuals, especially with a Ham; and was much surprized when I
told him, it was part of a Hog that had been killed six Months ago.
I was so much diverted to see him handle a Fork, which it seems he
had never used before, that I could hardly keep my Countenance, so
aukwardly did he manage it. Amongst other dishes there was brought
to the Table a Pye of minced meat. Of this he eat greedily, asking
me, “How it was prepared?” I told him the manner; adding it was done
by my Wife, and being put up in earthen Pans, it would keep in so
hot a Country as this was, for six Months at least. He then asked
me, “How many Wives I had?” I told him we were allowed by our Laws
but one; on which he fell a laughing, saying, “He had five hundred,
and wished fifty of them could prepare such meat for him as mine had
done.” After this the Servants brought _Bananas_, with other Fruit of
the Country, on _Delft_ Plates. These Plates he was much taken with,
and desired I would give him that he eat on, with the Knife, Fork,
and Napkin he used. I told him he was welcome to all on the Table:
Of which the Linguist had no sooner informed him, but he spoke to his
Servants, and they immediately swept all away, so suddenly, that they
had like to have broke all the Plates, but they luckily escaped. I
put on a good Face on the matter, tho’ I was something surprized to
be so soon taken at my word, with the manner of it; so I said to him,
“I would present him further with some Mugs and Cups, which I called
for.”

I had almost forgot to relate another Circumstance, full as odd
as this. When we first sat down to dinner, some of his principal
Servants who stood behind his Chair, would every now and then snatch
off his Plate, a Slice of Ham or Fowl; and observing he did not
rebuke them for it, I bid the Linguist tell him, “His Servants should
not want for Victuals after we had dined; for it was not the white
Peoples custom, to let their Guests Attendants go home hungry;” so he
ordered them to be quiet for the future.

After dinner we drank both our Kings healths, and he grew very merry,
preferring Punch to other Liquors. When he took his leave of me in
the Evening, he express’d great Satisfaction at his Entertainment:
Moreover he told me, “He design’d to go and see the Sea the next
day, (which was about three Miles off) and as he had never yet seen
it, nor a Ship, he should be glad of my Company.” But I was obliged
to excuse my self, on account of my late Illness, from which I was
not perfectly recovered. So I told him, “I would order my Officer in
the Tent, to entertain him in the best manner he could; and if he
would be pleased to go on board my Ship to see her, all possible Care
should be taken of him.”

I must now leave this great Man for a while, and give an Account of
a remarkable thing that happened whilst he was at the Sea side. For
the right understanding of it, the Reader is to know, That a few days
before the great Captain came to _Jaqueen_, the Linguist brought me
two Female _Negroes_, saying, “The King desired, I would buy them,
and promise I would not let them be redeemed by any one that should
offer to do it:” After I had viewed these Women, one of which was
turned of fifty, and the other about twenty Years old, I told the
Linguist, “The first was past her Labour, and not for my purpose; but
I would buy the other.” He replied, “He could not part them; adding,
It would highly oblige the King if I took them both:” But suspecting
he made use of the King’s Name, to get rid of an old Woman, I refused
it, and he carried them away. I little suspected then what would
happen to this poor Creature, which I shall presently relate.

The great Captain, as he had told me, went the next day to the Sea
side, accompanied by abundance of People who came from the inland
Country, which indeed they daily did in great Numbers, to see so
rare a sight, now the ways were open to them. There lay then at
Anchor, in the Road of _Jaqueen_, the _Katherine_ Galley which I
commanded, being a fine Ship of near three hundred Tuns burthen; and
two _Portuguese_ Vessels. This sight exceedingly surprized him, as
well as did the Sea, which came rolling and roaring with its Billows
on the Shore; so that he stood for some time fixed as if he had
been a Statue, till he heard the Guns fired from the _Katherine_,
wherewith I had ordered him to be saluted, on a signal made from our
Tent. Being by the Noise of the Guns roused out of his Astonishment,
my Officer then invited him to go to the Tent to dinner, which he
readily accepted. Whilst he was at dinner, he could not sit still
three minutes together, his Curiosity still prompting him to go and
look on the Sea and Ships.

As the Water near the Shore is very shallow, our Boats cannot
approach nearer than within two Cables length, so that we are obliged
to make use of _Cannoes_, which draw much less Water than our Boats,
to land our Goods: And also the fresh Water for the Ship’s use,
is rafted in Casks by Ropes from the Boats. The great Man was so
pleased with the sight, that he went too near the Sea to see it; in
which instant a Wave coming with great force, reached him so, that
with the surprize he fell on his back; by which Accident some salt
Water got into his Stomach. His Servants seeing him fall, immediately
run to his Assistance; and taking him up, carried him to our Tent,
where he drank half a pint of Brandy, to qualify the salt Water he
had swallowed down. Tho’ he had met with this mischance, he stay’d at
the Tent till the Evening, and then left the place with reluctance,
to come to Town; so much delighted was he with this sight. It was
about nine a clock at night when he returned to _Jaqueen_, being
usher’d in with the hideous noise of their musical Instruments, and
the Acclamations of the People.

Soon after, one of his principal Servants, together with the
Linguist, came to me, saying, “The Great Man had sent them to return
me thanks for the kind Entertainment he had received at my Tent;
that he designed to set out next day for the King’s Camp, and should
be glad to see me before he went.”

The Servant being gone, the Linguist told me in private, “That the
oldest Woman whom I had refused to buy, had that day been sacrificed
to the Sea, by order of the great Captain. For she had highly
offended the King, and as I would not take her, his Majesty had
ordered her to be destroyed this way, in the room of another Victim
that was designed for the same Purpose.” I asked him, What Crimes
she had committed? He replied hastily, “Did I think he knew the
King’s Secrets? adding, She had lived a long time in the Court, with
good Repute till now.” I then wish’d in my mind I had bought her;
but only said to the Linguist, “I wondered he should have a hand in
such Cruelty, having been bred up amongst white People.” To which he
answered, “Great Mens Commands were not to be disputed, especially
there being no one but himself of the _Dahomes_, that durst go off
in a Cannoe with her.” Whereupon he told me the following Story; “The
Woman’s Hands being tied behind her, and her Feet across, she was put
into the _Cannoe_, and carried off about half a Mile from the Shore:
And then he ordered the Rowers to throw her over board; which they
had no sooner done, but he saw some Sharks (voracious Fishes very
common in those Seas) tear her to pieces in an instant.” On hearing
this Account I pitied the Fate of this poor Creature, for I intirely
credited the Story, knowing full well the Barbarity of those People.
But the next day I was greatly surprized, with a Letter from my chief
Mate, informing me, that the Woman was on board our Ship: Which
happened in this manner. It seems, neither my People at the Tent,
nor those in our Boats, which lay at the Moorings near the Shore,
knew any thing of the real occasion of the Cannoe’s going off. For
the Woman was put very privately into the Cannoe. They only thought
the Linguist was gone, with a design to see some of the Ships. When
he came on shore again, one of our Boats went just then from the
Moorings, in order to go on board our Ship. Being got about half way,
the Officer in the Boat spied something floating on the Sea, which
at his coming nearer, he perceived to be a human Body lying on its
back; and now and then spurting Water out at the Mouth. This showing
it was still living, he ordered it to be taken into the Boat, being
bound in the same manner as the Linguist had told me. Immediately
they untied this poor Woman, chafed her Limbs, and rolled her Body
about, whereupon she discharged a good quantity of salt Water out
of her Mouth. Then they carried her on board the Ship, not knowing
in the least the occasion of her being in the Sea, and extremely
wondering she had escaped the Sharks, who are usually so voracious,
that when a dead Person is thrown overboard, or a living one falls
into the Sea by Accident, they are in an instant torn to pieces by
those voracious Animals. So that this poor Creature seemed to have
a miraculous Escape; and the knowledge of the greediness of these
Sharks, I suppose, induced the Linguist to tell me, that he actually
saw her torn to pieces; verily believing it would so happen, which
his Fears would not let him stay to see, on account of the great
swell the Billows of the Sea had at that time.

Upon my receiving the above-mentioned account from the Mate, tho’
pleas’d with the safety of the poor Woman, yet it filled me with
Apprehensions, if the King of _Dahomè_ should come to know it: For
he might pretend, his _Fetiche_, or God, being disappointed of this
Sacrifice by us, would revenge it on me, or at least oblige me to
make up the Affair with large Presents. So having considered of the
matter, I writ to the chief Mate, to charge our People to keep the
thing secret; it being of the utmost Consequence to us all to do it:
Which they accordingly did. Some time after, going on board the Ship,
I examined this Woman by the Linguist, but she would never confess
the reason of the King’s displeasure against her; alledging she knew
not that she had in any respect offended him. However, I found by the
Linguist, that he suspected, it was on account of her assisting some
of the King’s Women in their Amours.

This Woman being a sensible Person, did us good service in the
Voyage. For she was known to several of the Negroes on board, and by
her talking to and advising them, made them easy in their Minds: She
observed to them, amongst other things, “That as we had shown such
Kindness to her, first in saving her Life, and since in taking care
of her, who might be reckoned an useless Person to us, on account of
her Age; so they had all the reason in the World to believe we were
much better people than their own Countrymen; and that the strange
Stories they had been formerly told of white People, must be false.”
The female _Negroes_, who used always to be the most troublesome to
us, on account of the noise and clamour they made, were kept in such
Order and Decorum by this Woman, that I had never the like in any
Voyage before: And when I came to _Antegoa_, _Charles Dunbar_ Esq;
Surveyor General of _Barbadoes_, and the _Leeward Islands_, on my
Recommendation, bought her, and I was not a little pleased she had
got so generous and good a Master.

But to return again to the great Captain: When he was ready to depart
from _Jaqueen_, all the _Europeans_ in the Place waited on him to
the side of the River, that runs on the back part of the Town. Upon
taking leave I told him, “I wanted but eighty _Negroes_ to compleat
my Cargo,” and he promised he would acquaint the King with it; and
I might be sure his Majesty would send them down to me forthwith.
However, this did not happen according to my Expectation; for I
understood afterwards the King had no Slaves by him for sale, tho’ he
had great numbers of captive _Negroes_, which tilled his Grounds, and
did other Work. For, it seems, after they are once inrolled for that
Service, his Majesty never sells them, unless they are guilty of very
great Crimes.

After the great Captain’s departure, I was obliged to wait a long
while for a dispatch; at last the desired Time came, and the King’s
Factors that brought the _Negroes_ behaved themselves so well towards
me, that I had no reason to complain of them. The principal amongst
them told me, “The King was much surprized, that I had not been
dispatch’d before; and that his Majesty had punished those severely,
who had been the occasion of my long stay at _Jaqueen_: That if my
Affairs would admit of my going to the Camp, the King was desirous
to see me again there, to discourse, and settle Matters, for the
mutual Interest of himself, and the _Europeans_ trading to his
Country; for when I was with him before, the great Hurry of Affairs
his Majesty had then on his Hands, did not allow him sufficient time
to talk of Business.” I desired the Gentleman to return the King
my due Acknowledgments for all his Favours; “and that I should have
been very glad and ready to have waited again on his Majesty at the
Camp: But the bad state of health I was then in, did not allow it;
of which himself being an Eye-Witness, I desired he would be pleased
to inform the King of it: Adding, I should not fail, on my arrival
into _England_, to tell my Countrymen who trade to this place, how
great and generous a Prince I had been entertained by; hoping (if
God bless’d me) to return again in a twelvemonth at farthest.” So
having made the Traders some small Presents, they took their Leaves,
returning many thanks for what I had given them.

As soon as I had finished my Affairs with these People, I waited
on the Lord of _Jaqueen_, and told him, “That having compleated my
Ship’s Cargoe of _Negroes_, I design’d to go on board in two days
time, desiring he would be pleased to pay me the ballance of an
account that was between us.” This he readily promised, but never
performed it. Moreover, the next day, having paid his Brother the
rest of the Customs, and my Servants their Wages, my Store-house was
soon after plundered in a violent manner: But, by good fortune, there
were in it, only things of small value. I complained of this Usage,
but had no Redress. However, I did not think proper to threaten, as I
had formerly done, “That I would inform the King of _Dahomè_ of it;”
but quietly putting up the Affront, I went to the Sea side the next
day, where I was obliged to lie all night in our Tent, because the
Sea ran high on the Shore; but the next morning it being calmer, I
got on board to my great Satisfaction, having, through the goodness
of Providence, compleated my Affairs, much beyond my Expedition,
considering I had so melancholy a Prospect, when I first came to this
Country.

The first of _July 1727_, we sailed from the Road of _Jaqueen_,
having on board above 600 _Negroes_. I had a tedious Passage to
the _West-Indies_ of seventeen Weeks, which obliged us to stop at
several places for Water and Provision. But at length we arrived at
_Antegoa_, where the Cargo of _Negroes_ (who had stood very well)
came to a good Market: And having lain there for a Cargo of Sugars,
we sailed from thence the latter end of _February_, and got safe into
the River of _Thames_, the 25th of _April_ 1728, having been sixteen
Months on this remarkable VOYAGE.

                                  A

                             SUPPLEMENT,

  _Containing an Account of what happened to the King and People
  of_ Whidaw, _and the_ Dahomes, _since I came away from thence, to
  the Time of my return thither in the Month of_ February 1729-30.
  _All which I was informed of, by some white Gentlemen of good
  Credit, who resided at_ Jaqueen _all the Time I was absent_.


Upon my coming to _England_, being in a bad State of Health, I
desired leave of my Owner to stay at home a Season, which he was
pleased to grant me; and appointed Captain _John Dagge_ to command
the Ship I had been in. He made a successful Voyage, and returned
with her in the Month of _August_ 1729: As I was by that time very
well recovered, my Owner was pleased to send me again to the Coast
of _Guinea_ in the _Katherine Galley_. Having therefore spent some
time on the _Windward_ and _Gold Coast_, I proceeded for _Whidaw_.
In my way to that place I stop’d at _Great Popoe_, which lies a few
Leagues to the Windward of _Whidaw_. Being informed there, that the
late King of _Whidaw_ was near that place, with _Captain Ossue_, one
of his principal Cabociers or Lords, on two barren sandy Islands,
with many other People, I sent my first Mate on Shore with a Present
to each of them. He returned at night, with some of the King’s
People, who brought me a Goat from him: Saying, “Their Master being
in a poor Condition, had nothing better to send me.” And they having
bought some few things, I sent them on Shore again. After they were
gone, my Mate gave me the following account, “That the King and
Captain _Ossue_, had with them many Thousands of People who lived in
a miserable manner, the Islands they were on being so barren, that
they produced nothing: But by means of the River which separated them
from the Continent, they were very well secured from the _Dahomes_
Power; who not understanding the Management of _Cannoes_, could not
invade them. Moreover, they had planted several great Guns, which
secured the Passes, so that they were in no fear of the Enemies. But
then, on the other hand, they could not sow Corn, or other Pulse in
that barren place, but were supplied with what they wanted by their
Neighbours of _Great_ and _Little Popoe_. However, this constantly
decreased their Numbers, they being obliged to sell their Wives,
Children, and Servants for Provisions and other necessaries, because
they had no Money left.”

From _Great Popoe_ I went to the Road of _Whidaw_, where being
informed there was little Trade, I proceeded for _Jaqueen_, which is
seven Leagues to the Eastward of it; and anchored in that road the
20th of _February_ 1729-30: At my going on Shore there, the King of
_Dahomè_’s Agent came to see me; and upon my enquiring after his
Master’s welfare, he told me, “He would send a Messenger to inform
his Majesty of my Arrival: But as the King was then in his own
Country, far inland, it would be at least twenty days before he could
have an Answer.” At his taking leave, he promised to let me know
his Master’s Pleasure on the return of the Messenger. Accordingly
he came to see me again, about three weeks after his former visit,
and told me, “The King was very glad to hear of my being once more
arrived at _Jaqueen_; but as he was then far within Land, tho’ he was
desirous of seeing me again, yet he could not in reason require it:
His Master being sensible, such a long Journey would be neither safe
for my Health, nor suitable to my Business; but in case the King came
to _Ardra_, whilst I was at _Jaqueen_, which is but two days journey
off, and where I had formerly been with his Majesty, he should be
very glad to see me there once more.” However, this not happening, I
had not the Fortune to see the King a second time.

I now come to relate what I heard from several white Gentlemen
residing at _Jaqueen_, ever since my former Voyage, concerning the
_Whidaws_ and the _Dahomes_. The King of _Whidaw_, with abundance
of his People, having fled to the Islands formerly mentioned, the
King of _Dahomè_ was disappointed in his design of destroying
him, as he had always intended. So that he contented himself with
keeping Possession of the Country of _Whidaw_, by an Army encamp’d
at _Sabee_, which had been the principal place of the Kingdom, till
destroyed by him. But in time this Army being much diminished, it
incouraged Captain _Ossue_ to leave the Islands, and settle himself,
with many of his People, near the _French_ Fort, which is about four
Miles from _Sabee_; believing the great Guns therein would be a
sufficient Protection from the _Dahomes_, in case they should offer
to disturb him. This Fort had a dry Ditch, with mud Walls made of the
Earth that was dug out of it; and was a square place with Towers
at each Corner, on which were mounted several Cannons; and their
Lodgings, Storehouses, and even their Magazine of Gunpowder, were
covered with Rushes, according to the Custom of that Country; which
occasioned a terrible Misfortune, as shall be immediately related.

The King of _Dahomè_ being informed of Captain _Ossue_’s return
into his Country, resolved to send an Army to drive him out; which
the other having notice of, retired with many of his People into
the _French_ Fort: _Ossue_ little thinking at that time, that the
Governor was the occasion of his Enemies coming in order to betray
them.

The next day after he and his People were received into the Fort,
the _Dahomè_ Army came down, and being informed the _French_ had
given them Protection, contrary to a secret Promise their King had
received from the Governor, they assaulted the Fort. But having
nothing but small Arms to make their Attack, it would have availed
little, had not the Thatch of the Houses within the Fort taken
Fire. This Accident alarmed the white Men, who knowing there was a
great quantity of Gunpowder in their Magazine, and no possibility
of stopping the Fire, fled to the _English_ Fort, which was within
Musquet-Shot of their own, and so saved themselves: But the black
People not being so sensible of their Danger, suffered very much
by the blowing up of the Magazine, there being above one thousand
of them killed, besides many wounded by this Accident. However,
in the Confusion, and under cover of the Smoke, Captain _Ossue_,
and several of his People, escaped to the _English_ Fort: Where
Governor _Wilson_, who then resided there for the _African_ Company,
generously gave them Protection; and to prevent Accidents, ordered
immediately all the Houses in the Fort to be unthatch’d, and by
firing on the _Dahomes_ with his Cannon, killed several, and kept the
rest at a distance.

The _Dahomes_ having taken the _French_ Fort, sheltered themselves
therein; and the next morning sent a principal Man amongst them
to Governor _Wilson_, to know the reason why he had fired on their
Army. To which he answered, “That they having come down out of the
Country in a hostile manner, without giving him the least notice, and
attacked his Neighbours the _French_, he looked on it as the common
Cause of all the _Europeans_ settled there, who were bound to assist
one another.” To this the _Dahomes_ replied, “That when they came
down, they had no design to attack the _French_ Fort, for the King
had no quarrel with the white Men: But the Governor having taken
Captain _Ossue_ and his People into the _French_ Fort, contrary to
his Promise, it obliged them to act as they had done.” At the same
time they told the Governor to his Face, “That he had first sent to
their King by a _French_ Surgeon, then residing with their Master,
to persuade his Majesty to send an Army down, to destroy Captain
_Ossue_ and his People; promising at the same time he would give
them no Protection.” This the _French_ Governor denied, but all that
were present believed it to be too true; and by this means he let the
_Dahomes_ see, that white Men (whom they had before a high opinion
of) could be the basest of Villains, when their Interest tempted them
thereto. For it was much suspected, that the Governour had contrived
the whole Affair, in order to squeeze a large Sum of Money from
Captain _Ossue_ to protect him, and for some other infamous Views.
However, he met afterwards with a suitable Reward, being killed by
the _Whidaws_, whom he had so much injured.

As soon as the King of _Dahomè_ was informed of the taking of the
_French_ Fort, he sent this Message to the _French_ Governor; “that
he had brought this Misfortune on himself by his Perfidy, for he had
no quarrel to his Nation; therefore he would order his Soldiers to
repair the Fort, which had been greatly damaged by the Powder: Or if
he did not desire this, he might depart with all the _Frenchmen_ to
his own Country.” After this, the Ships that lay then in the Road of
_Whidaw_ had good Trade for Women and Children, which the _Dahomes_
had taken of Captain _Ossue_’s People, but there were few Men taken;
many of them being lost when the Magazine blew up: and the rest
having fled to the Island which their King was in.

I come now to relate a great Misfortune which befel the _Dahomes_,
some Months after they had taken the _French_ Fort. For the better
understanding of it, the Reader is to know, that the King of
_Dahomè_ having conquered several Countries within a few Years, and
depopulated them; the King of _Weemey_’s Sons, with other Princes,
(whose Fathers this Conqueror had taken in War, and beheaded) fled to
a far Inland Potent Nation called the _J-oes_. The King of _Whidaw_
having, after _Ossue_’s Defeat, found means to send Messengers to
the King of this Country, they, and the others that had fled to him
for Protection, did at last, through their earnest Sollicitations,
obtain an Army to march against the King of _Dahomè_, whom they all
look’d upon as a most cruel Destroyer of Mankind. This Nation of
_J-oe_ fight all on Horseback, and living a great way on the North
towards _Nubia_, they can at no other time march to the Southward,
but when the Season for Forage, and the dry Weather sets in. The
King of _Dahomè_ had notice of their coming, a few days before they
reached his Country; and he having formerly experienced how terrible
such Numbers of Horse had been to his Army, which consists of none
but foot Soldiers; he resolved to bury his Riches, burn his Towns,
and then fly into the Woods and Thickets with his People; which is a
common thing amongst the _Negroes_, for the weaker side to do, when
at War; for they have no fortified Towns as in _Europe_: So they that
are Masters of the Field command the Country far and near.

The King of _Dahomè_ having thus in time provided for his Safety by
Flight, the _J-oes_ were disappointed: But one _Appragah_ and his
People, formerly subject to the King of _Whidaw_, but now under the
Dominion of the _Dahomes_, did not escape so well. For not moving so
soon by two days as they did, the _J-oes_ came up with him and his
People, and took abundance of them, with all _Appragah_’s Riches; and
he himself was hardly put to it to escape, with a few of his Servants.

After this the _J-oes_ marched on in quest of the _Dahomes_, but
finding they were got into the thick Woods and Bushes, they incamped
near them; making frequent Assaults, and often taking some of the
_Dahomes_ Prisoners. At last, they so distressed them, that for
want of other Provision, they were obliged to eat many of their own
Slaves. Yet the _Dahomes_ patiently endured these Calamities, knowing
the _J-oes_ would be obliged to retire in a little time, on account
of the rainy Season that was approaching, and for want of Forage:
Accordingly they were obliged to retire soon after; and the _Dahomes_
then returned to their own Country, and rebuilt their Towns again.

During these Misfortunes of the _Dahomes_, which lasted several
Months, various Reports came to _Whidaw_. Sometimes it was said,
“That the King of _Dahomè_ was killed:” But that was again
contradicted: And it was reported, “he had lost so many of his
People, that he never could be again in a Condition to disturb his
Neighbours;” and this was so currently believed that no one doubted
of it.

About this time, which was in the beginning of _July_ 1729, Governor
_Wilson_ departed from _Whidaw_, in order to return to _England_.
He left in his room one Mr. _Testefole_, who had resided there many
Years, but was no ways equal to him in Prudence and Conduct, as his
unhappy Fate will afterwards show. For tho’ this Person had been
often at the King of _Dahomè_’s Camp, where he was always used with
great Civility, yet now believing that King was so far reduced, that
the People of _Whidaw_ had nothing more to fear from him; he too
hastily advised their King, to leave the barren Islands wherein he
had fled with his People, and come and take again Possession of his
Country.

Hereupon the King of _Whidaw_ resolved to return; and, to provide
against the worst, he desired his Neighbours of _Popoe_ to lend him
some of their Forces; which they readily did. For these People, with
all the _Coast-Negroes_, mortally hate the _Dahomes_, on account
of their Cruelty, and their Barbarity in eating human Flesh. And,
besides that the _Popoes_ are little afraid of the _Dahomes_ Power,
because they live in Islands, they now assisted the _Whidaws_ out of
Policy; thinking, if they were reinstated in their Country, Trade
would soon revive, which had been so long interrupted on account of
the War. So they sent them some thousands of their People; and at
their Arrival the King of _Whidaw_ joined them with his Forces. Tho’
he was a very fat unwieldy Man, yet he marched at the head of his
Army, which consisted of about fifteen thousand Men, including the
_Popoes_, and incamped in his own Country for some time, near the
_English_ and _French_ Forts. This the _Dahomes_ knew nothing of;
for they had so mean an opinion of the _Whidaws_, that they never
thought they would attempt to settle again in their own Country:
Neither had they, since the departure of the _J-oes_, sent any of
their People to the Sea side, having been employed in repairing
their Towns, and about other Affairs. These being near finished, the
King of _Dahomè_ sent some of his Traders down with Slaves, to the
_English_ and _French_ Forts: But his People were much surprised to
see such an Army of _Whidaws_ incamped near them. So they returned in
great haste to inform their King, who upon the receipt of this News,
was greatly embarassed; for he had lost many of his best Soldiers
whilst the _J-oes_ remained in his Country, and kept him so long in
the Bushes. Moreover, his Majesty had lately sent an Army into the
inland Country, to take Slaves: For as I have formerly observed, he
drives no regular Trade in Slaves, but only sells such as he takes in
his Wars.

Being in this State of Perplexity (when he had not a sufficient
Number of Soldiers to encounter the _Whidaws_ and _Popoes_ together,
and, on the other hand, could not bear to see himself braved by such
a cowardly Race as the _Whidaws_,) his Policy extricated him out of
this Difficulty. He ordered a great number of Women to be armed like
Soldiers, and appointed Officers to each Company, with Colours, Drums
and Umbrellas, according to the _Negroe_ Fashion. Then ordering the
Army to march, the Women Soldiers were placed in the Rear, to prevent
Discovery. When they came in sight of the _Whidaw_ Army, the latter
were much surprized to see such Numbers of _Dahomè_ Soldiers, as
they supposed them all to be, marching against them: For they had
much depended on the former Reports, that they were so far reduced,
as not to be able (at least so soon) to have made Head against them.
At this unexpected sight the _Whidaws_ were divided: Some were for
retiring back to the Islands; but others who were commanded by
Captain _Ossue_, with the _Popoes_, were for fighting. During this
Dispute, the _Dahomè_ Army marched on boldly, and Captain _Ossue_,
with the _Popoe_ General, as bravely advanced to meet them; and
attacked their right Wing so briskly, that they drove them for some
time before them. But the _Whidaws_ who were with the King, at that
instant cowardly fled; tho’ his Majesty used his utmost endeavours
and Intreaties to stop them, and at last wounded several with his
Lance, to oblige them to second Captain _Ossue_’s People: But all
in vain. This being observed by the left Wing of the _Dahomes_,
they fell on the Rear of _Ossue_’s Soldiers, and soon obliged them
and the _Popoes_, to fly in their turn; which the King of _Whidaw_
perceiving, and being so very unwieldy and fat, he had no other way
to save his Life, but to fly into the dry Ditch of the _English_
Fort; where, by the help of two of his Sons, his Majesty got over the
Wall, and so escaped the fury of his Enemies: But many of his People
were killed, and others taken.

Mr. _Testefole_, the Governor, was at a great loss how to act on
this occasion. For he foresaw the _Dahomes_ would demand the King,
and insist on his being delivered to them, as soon as they should
know he was in the Fort. Which if he refused to do, he was sensible,
they could oblige him in time to do it, by starving him. Moreover,
he could not but sustain a great loss by the Interruption of Trade.
So the Governor persuaded the King to leave the Fort that Night, and
he happily escaped to his barren Islands again. However, the King
of _Dahomè_ was afterwards fully informed of all this, and likewise
that the Governor had been the principal occasion of the _Whidaws_
endeavouring to regain their Country: Which he highly resented.

The _Dahomes_, after this, retired from about the Forts, and, leaving
a small Army at _Sabee_, returned to their own Country; where many
Banditti of other Nations resorting to them, their King, in a few
Months, found his Strength and Power as much increased, as when he
fled from the _J-oes_. But the Countries being laid waste far and
near by his former Wars, tho’ he has large Territories of many
hundred Miles, and as fine a Country under his Dominion, as any in
the Southern Parts of _Africa_; yet he is only a great King in name
for want of Subjects, by reason of his having destroyed in so cruel a
manner the Inhabitants of all the Places he has conquered. This has
obliged many hundred thousands to fly from his Arms, into foreign
Countries; that are by Situation secured from his rambling Bands,
either by great Rivers, Mountains or Lakes.

He has acted since as impolitick a part in another matter. For he
gave his word to a great number of the former Inhabitants, If they
would return again into their own Country, they should quietly enjoy
it, upon paying a certain Tribute. On this many thousands returned
into the Kingdom of _Ardra_, where they built Houses, sowed Corn,
and planted Potatoes; but no sooner were these poor People settled,
than the _Dahomes_ surprized them, and killed or took captive all
that could not escape from them. The King having thus broken his
promise, I believe no others will ever venture to trust him: And the
Country, in all Probability, will remain uninhabited, during his
Life: Moreover, by this means the Trade at _Whidaw_ is almost ruined;
for the far inland People having now no Markets to carry their Slaves
to, as formerly, and the _Dahomes_ using no Trade but that of War,
few _Negroes_ are now brought down to be sold to the _Europeans_.

Whether it was the badness of Trade, occasioned by the _Dahomes_
acting in this manner, or any thing else, that enraged Mr.
_Testefole_ against them; he was so imprudent, that on all
Opportunities he used their People ill, when they came to the
_English_ Fort: And at last whipped one of their principal Men at
the Flag-Staff; and upon his complaining of this great Indignity,
_Testefole_ rashly replied, _He would serve his King in the same
manner if he was in his Power_. All this being afterwards reported
to his Majesty, it highly offended him: And he said, “Surely this
Man must be full of Malice against us, else he could never have so
suddenly forgot our former Kindnesses to him.”

The King upon this ordered his People to watch for an Opportunity
to surprize the Governor, and make him Prisoner; and his Imprudence
soon made him fall into their Hands in the following manner. There
was a _French_ Captain who had a Factory, at some distance from the
_English_ Fort: This Gentleman had been drinking with the Governor
all night, and when the day came, he persuaded Mr. _Testefole_ to go
and drink Coffee with him at his Factory. The _Dahomes_, who were
on the Watch, seeing him go to the _Frenchman_’s House, went and
surrounded it, demanding to have the Governor delivered to them.
This the Captain at first refused, but they threatning to burn his
Factory; he told them, He would forthwith bring him out. So he went
into the House, and advised Mr. _Testefole_ to make his Escape; which
he refusing to do, the Captain put him by force into a large Chest,
and lock’d him in: Then he went out, and told the _Dahomes_, “He
could not find the Governor, and that he believed he had escaped.”
This so enraged them, that they fired a Pistol at the Captain, which
shot him in the Arm, and thereupon broke into his House, where they
at last found the unfortunate Man in the Chest; whom they took
out, tied his Hands and Legs, and putting him into a Hammock, sent
him away to their King, who was at that time encamp’d up into the
Country, four days journey off.

This unhappy Gentleman flattered himself, that the former Kindness
the King had shown for him, would now save him; but his Majesty was
so highly offended, that he would not vouchsafe to see him; so that
he gave himself up for lost. However, a few days after this he was
sent down to _Sabee_, about four Miles from the Fort, where he was
given to understand, “If he would write to the Person that commanded
in his Abscence for several things, which they named for his Ransom,
that on their being sent he should have his Liberty.”

This he readily complied with, and they instantly allowed him more
Freedom, permitting two of his own Negroe Servants to wait on him; so
that he began to be easy in his Mind: But the Scene soon changed; for
on their receiving the Things he had writ for, and which were of a
considerable Value, these cruel base Villains seized his Person, and
made his Body fast to Stakes drove in the Ground: Where, spreading
him on his Belly, they with sharp Knives cut open his Arms, Back,
Thighs and Legs in several places, and filled the Wounds with a
mixture of Limejuice, Salt and Pepper mixed together; which put him
to inexpressible Torment. However, they soon after put him out of
his pain, by cutting off his Head. Then they cut his Body in pieces,
broiled them on the Coals, and eat them.

Thus this poor Gentleman lost his Life in a terrible manner. And tho’
the King of _Dahomè_ has since denied to some white People, “That he
gave Orders to have him put to death;” His Majesty saying, by way of
Excuse, “He only told some of his principal People to carry him to
_Sabee_, and there do with him what they thought fit, not suspecting
they would have used a white Gentleman in such a manner;” Yet it is
not to be doubted but they knew their Master’s Mind too well in this
Affair. For his Majesty punished none of those that were Actors in
this cruel Tragedy; tho’ it was earnestly insisted on. Nay some of
them that eat part of his Flesh, have been since so audacious, as to
tell several _Portuguese_ Gentlemen, that talked with them about it;
“That _English_ Beef was very good.”

After Mr. _Testefole_’s unhappy Fate, two white Men running away
from the _English_ Fort, one of them went to the King of _Dahomè_,
and informed him, “There were but four white People left in the
place, so that he might easily take it.” The King replied, “He had
no quarrel with the _English_ Nation; for what had been done to the
late Governor, he by his Imprudence had brought on himself: And he
hoped, the _African_ Company would send a fitter Person to command
the _Fort_ for the future.”

Sometime after this the King of _Dahomè_ considering he should
certainly be invaded again by the _J-oes_, as soon as the Season
permitted them to march, and dreading very much their power, he sent
Embassadors with large Presents to their King, together with one of
his handsomest Daughters. These were civilly received, and had the
good fortune to succeed in their Negotiations. For they so gained
some great Men about the King, by presenting them with large pieces
of _Coral_ (which the _J-oes_ esteem above all things) that by their
means an advantagious Peace was obtained for their Master, and they
were civilly dismissed with handsome Rewards. For a Confirmation of
the Peace, the King of _J-oe_ sent, a little while after, one of his
Daughters to the King of _Dahomè_ for a Wife; and she was received
with great Joy by the King and his People.

At my going on Shore at _Jaqueen_, the latter end of _February_
1729-30: I was informed of all that I have here related; and tho’ I
found Trade very dull, yet all the white Gentlemen residing at that
place, were full of Expectations, That, now a Peace was concluded
between the _J-oes_ and the _Dahomes_, we should soon have a great
many _Negroes_ brought down for Sale. But tho’ I was there above two
Months, Trade did not mend in the least: And I am afraid it will not
for many Years, because of the great Destruction of the Inhabitants
of the neighbouring Countries, who used to carry on a regular Trade
with the far inland People: Neither will those that had the good
fortune to escape the _Dahomes_ Cruelty, dare to return during the
Life of the present Conqueror, whose Perfidiousness and Treachery
they have often experienced.

I shall conclude this first Book with an account of a Misfortune
that befel me by Fire, whilst I was at _Jaqueen_. The relation,
if I mistake not, may be acceptable to the Reader, and give him a
true notion of the Buildings, and some other Matters amongst the
_Negroes_.

The Houses in that Country are built with mud-Walls, one Story high.
The Rafters that support the Roof are made of _Bamboes_, which is
a light spungy Wood. On these they lay a great quantity of Thatch,
which in the dry Season of the Year is like Tinder: Yet the Natives
are so careless, that many Fires happen in that Season; there having
been no less than five during the two Months I was there, in which
some thousands of their Houses were burnt down. This carelesness of
the _Negroes_, I judge, chiefly proceeds from the little regard they
have for their Furniture. For it is very mean, except amongst some
of the principal People, consisting of _Matts_ to sleep on, earthen
_Pots_ to boil their Victuals in; with a few other things of small
value. Moreover, the Walls of their Houses being made of Clay, the
Fire does them rather good than hurt, as it bakes them harder. And
to new cover them it costs but little. So that the _Europeans_ that
have Factories in the Town of _Jaqueen_, are often great Sufferers
by these frequent Fires, occasioned generally by the stupid
Carelessness of the Negroes, which proceeds from the Reasons just now
mentioned.

I thought our Factory pretty safe from it, for we lived in a large
Court belonging to the Duke, who was the only Brother of the Lord
of the Place by the same Mother, and his chief Minister. This House
joined to the Apartments of the Duke’s Women, which it being a
capital Crime for the Natives to go into, so it would have been very
imprudent for any white Man to have attempted it: Yet the Fire,
obliged us to save our selves that way, as I shall just now relate.
The other side of the Court we lived in, opened into the Fields; and
just by our Door a narrow Street began, where the Lord of _Jaqueen_’s
_Feticheer_ or Priest lived with his Family.

Two Fires having happened in the Town, within a few days one of the
other, in which some _Portuguese_ suffered a great Loss in their
Goods, I express’d my apprehensions of the like Danger. But the Duke
assured me, “It was never known, that either his Brother’s Houses,
or his own had been burn’d. For they having abundance of Servants, if
any Fire began near them, their People, by unthatching the Houses,
soon put a stop to it. Moreover, all the Inhabitants who lived near
the Court, were very careful of Fire; because it was death by their
Law to all the Family where it began.” These Reasons made me more
easy than I had been for some time. But on the fifteenth of _March_,
being _Sunday_, what I long feared came to pass.

My hired black Servants asked me leave after Dinner, to go to the
Burial of one of their acquaintance; and several of my white People
did the same, being desirous to see the Customs of the Blacks on this
occasion: In which indeed they are very ridiculous and expensive,
drinking as much Brandy and other Liquors, as the Circumstances of
the deceased Person will allow. I granted them all their request;
and by that means there remained only two white Men with me in the
Factory.

The Fire began about two a clock that afternoon, in the _Feticheer_’s
House, just opposite to our Door, which immediately taking Fire,
prevented our Escape that way. However in the first Surprize, I gave
my Box of Books and Accounts to one of my young Men, who ventured
through the Door-way with them, tho’ he was scorched by the Flames;
and so I luckily saved them. My next care was to save our _Gold_,
which I kept in a large _Dutch_ Chest, thinking it safer there than
in a Portmanteau, or a small Box, which our black Servants might have
been tempted to run away with. But, in the hurry, I could not find
the Key of the Chest, to take the Money out; and the Fire having
taken hold of the Thatch of the room wherein it stood, I and the
other white Man then remaining with me, took it up, and carried it
into the Apartments belonging to the Duke’s Women: Where we met him
and his Brother with many People, going to endeavour to stop the
Fire, by unthatching the adjoining Houses; but the Flames were got to
such a head, that they were soon forced to fly before them. My Man
and I having carried the Chest through several windings and turnings
in the Duke’s Houses, we began to be quite tired, (for it was very
heavy) when, just in the nick of time, five black People came running
towards us, and the way was so narrow they could not easily pass by
us. One of these Men I knew, who spoke good _English_, “so I desired
him and the others to save the Chest, for which I would well reward
them.” He answered, “They durst not assist me; being obliged, on
no less a Penalty than the loss of their Heads, to go and save the
Duke’s Goods.” By good fortune I had my Cane then hanging on my
Wrist, which I used to such purpose, that two of them immediately
took up the Chest; whereupon I let the other three pass by: So, with
the help of the two Men I had obliged to assist us, we got the Chest
at last over a Wall ten foot high, into the Street, and so to the
_Dutch_ Factory in safety. But we had the Misfortune to lose in our
Factory a large quantity of Goods, with all my Necessaries, except
what was in the Chest. All the Duke’s houses, and the greatest part
of his Furniture was destroyed; but his Brother’s were preserved, by
unthatching the Houses that stood next his Court. I think, for the
time this Fire lasted, which was but about an hour, nothing could
be fiercer or quicker; and had it happened in the night, we should
certainly have been burnt; for we could never have found our way
out, amongst so many Turnings and Windings, as were in the Dukes
Apartments.

When the hurry was pretty well over, the Lord of _Jaqueen_ inquired
after me, being under some concern about me; for he did not see me as
he passed along in his Brother’s Rooms: As soon as he was informed
of my Safety, he sent a Messenger to enquire, “How I did, after so
severe a Misfortune?”

It is remarkable, we could never learn how this Fire happened, for
tho’ I often press’d the Duke to make an inquiry after it, yet he
always declined it; which I believe was on account of his Brother’s
_Feticheer_, in whose Family the Fire began. However, they were so
wise as not to let them repair their Houses, but obliged them to
build further from the Court which belonged to the Duke.

Adjoining to the _Feticheer_’s House that was burnt, there was a
large square Court, adorned with many handsome Trees that grew
round it. In the middle of this place stood the Lord of _Jaqueen_’s
_Fetiche_. It was made in the fashion of a large Hay-cock, and
covered over with Thatch: On the top of this was placed a dead Man’s
Scull, before which Offerings were made for the Duke’s Health and
Preservation. This _Fetiche_ escaped being burn’d, tho’ all the
Houses adjoining to the Court wherein it stood were consum’d. This
was cryed up by the People as a great Miracle; saying, “Their Lord’s
God had taken care to preserve his own House:” Tho’ by what I could
judge it was impossible this _Fetiche_ should be burn’d, because
it was at a considerable distance from the Fire, and guarded by so
many Trees full of Branches and Leaves. But it was in vain to argue
against their superstitious Notion.

After this Misfortune, I sent my People on board to get them more
necessaries; during which time I remained in the _Dutch_ Factory.
On their return ashore, I was obliged, tho’ much against my will,
to take a new-built house belonging to the Duke, but finding no one
durst let me one (which it seems had been forbidden for the sake of
the Duke’s Advantage) I complied. But what I feared came to pass, for
we all got Fevers in a few days after we had been in this House.

About ten days after this, another terrible Fire happened, which
began in a _Portuguese_ Factory, and in this manner. A _Negroe_ Cook
frying some Fish in Palm-Oyl, the Oyl took fire; and he imprudently
throwing Water thereon, the Flame of the Oyl ran up the side of the
Wall, (for the _Negroe_ Houses have no Chimneys) and instantly fired
the Thatch. Whereupon the Wind then blowing very fresh, it spread in
a moment and consumed, in two hours time, one third of the Town, in
which stood several thousands of their little Houses: However, this
did not come near our Factory.

Soon after this, my People grew so bad, that I was obliged to send
them on board the Ship, and have others ashore in their room: In
a little while after, the House we had been burnt out of, being
repaired, we removed into it; and by this means had the Opportunity
of seeing daily thousands of People bring _Bamboes_ and Thatch, to
repair the Duke’s Houses with; it being the Custom of the Country so
to do, when either their Lord or his Brother wants it. But the noise
of the People’s Musick, and antick dancing, on this occasion, gave me
much Disturbance: Moreover, Trade continuing still very dull, it gave
me no little concern; and having got rid of my Fever for a few days,
it returned again. Being in these unhappy Circumstances, I received
advice, that two of my Owner’s Ships were arrived in the Road of
_Jaqueen_. Whereupon I left my Factory, and went on board my Ship;
and there, the Commanders of the other two and I agreed, “It would be
for our Owner’s Interest that I should go directly for _England_.”
So, delivering to one of them what _Negroes_ I had on Board, and
receiving what Elephants Teeth, and Gold they had, I left the Road of
_Jaqueen_ the first day of _May_: And having had a fine Passage, in
which I intirely lost my Fever, and recovered my Strength a little, I
arrived safe in the River of _Thames_ the 13th of _July_ 1730.




                              ADDITIONS

                     _To the foregoing Account_.


As the Publication of this Book has been deferred till the Winter
Season, it may not be unacceptable to the Reader, to have a farther
Account of the King of _Dahomè_, according to the latest Advices come
from those Parts.

I ended the first Book with an account of that King’s having
concluded a Peace with the most powerful of his Enemies, the King of
_J-oe_. This put the _Europeans_ then residing at _Jaqueen_ in great
hopes, that those Countries would be settled, and Trade flourish
again; tho’ at my departure from that Place, in _May_ 1730, I saw but
little prospect of it: And indeed it has been quite ruined since, by
the Destruction of the Country of _Jaqueen_, on the 22nd of _March_
1731-2.

For the King of _Dahomè_ being a restless ambitious Prince, instead
of endeavouring (after the concluding of the Peace with the _J-oes_)
to settle his conquered Countries, he marched far Inland against a
Nation called the _Yahoos_.

These People valiantly defended themselves for many Months, having
retired amongst their Mountains and Woods, where they were besieged
by the _Dahomes_. The rainy Season coming on, the _Dahomè_ Soldiers
were desirous of returning to their own Country, but the King was
highly incensed at it, and put several of the principal Officers to
death, only for mentioning it to him. This caused great Murmurings in
the Army, which were increased by their Sufferings from the Rains; so
that some of his Captains deserted him with many Soldiers, amongst
whom was one of his Sons, who fled with four thousand Men to the King
of _Weemey_.

Finding himself in these Circumstances, he resolved to make one grand
Effort on the _Yahoos_, in which he prevailed; but tho’ he beat them
out of their Fastnesses, he gain’d little by it, they making a brave
Retreat, in which his wearied Soldiers could not pursue them; and
soon after he returned to his own Country, with the loss of most of
his Forces and of his Reputation.

At this the People of _Jaqueen_ were not a little pleased; for they
always stood in fear of him, but now began to entertain Hopes, he
might at last be destroyed.

There resided at that Place, a _Dutch_ Gentleman named _Mynheer
Hertog_. This Person carried on a considerable Trade, with the help
of his black Servants, into several distant Countries, by means of
a River that runs from _Jaqueen_ into the Bay of _Bennin_. Having
gained a great influence over the King of _Jaqueen_, they often
consulted together, sending private Messages by the Traders to the
King of _Weemey_, and other neighbouring Princes, to stir them
up against the King of _Dahomè_, and withal supplied them with
Ammunition. Of this the King of Dahomè having received Intelligence,
and also that the People of _Jaqueen_ were going to build a
Fortification by the Directions of the _Europeans_ residing there; he
resolved to attack them, in order to be revenged.

The better to deceive them, he gave out, that he intended a second
Expedition far inland: And to blind the _Jaqueen_ Spies, he gave
Order to his General to march towards the inland Parts, but in the
Night the Army wheeled about, and with great Expedition (tho’ there
were above fifteen thousand men in this Army) they came by the way of
_Whidaw_ to _Jaqueen_, without being discovered, till they were just
entring the Town.

As the People of _Jaqueen_ stood always in dread of the King of
_Dahomè_, (as I have just now mention’d) they kept in readiness a
great many _Cannoes_ in the River that runs on the back part of
the Town, to save themselves, in case they should be attacked and
defeated. But being now surprized, they had little time to provide
for their own Safety: However, the King and many of his principal
People escaped in the Cannoes, to an Island he had fortified against
such an Accident, and which lies in the middle of the River towards
_Appah_. By that means he escaped the fury of the _Dahomes_; but he
lost all his Riches, and, to add to his Misfortune, his Mother, (that
was highly reverenced by him and his People) was taken Prisoner by
the Enemy, and carried to the King of _Dahomè_; and what became of
her afterwards is unknown.

_Mynheer Hertog_, the _Dutch Chief_, was at dinner, when the
_Dahomes_ entered the Town: And knowing how obnoxious he had made
himself to their King, he immediately fled, being defended by four
hundred of his People from the Enemy, till he got into a Cannoe;
and then they shifted for themselves. He lost every thing in the
Factory, which at that time was full of _European Goods_ to a very
great Value. This Gentleman escaped to _Appah_, which lies on the Sea
Coast, about ten Leagues to the eastward of _Jaqueen_. He was kindly
received by the King and People, who have a great aversion for the
_Dahomes_.

In the Town of _Jaqueen_ the Conquerors met with a great deal of
Plunder, the Inhabitants not having had time to carry any thing away.
But not satisfied with this, they made, according to their barbarous
Custom, a terrible Carnage of the People; and to compleat the
Destruction of the Country, set all the Towns and Villages on fire.

There were at this time in _Jaqueen_ several _Europeans_, who fared
little better than the Natives; their Factories being plundered
of every thing. Amongst the rest there was Captain _Robert More_
Commander of the _Squirrel Galley_, belonging to the late _Humphrey
Morrice_ Esq; This Gentleman being taken Prisoner with the white
Men in his Factory, (as the _French_ and _Portuguese_ also were in
theirs) was obliged to travel with them to the King of _Dahomè_, who
then resided at _Ardra_, about fifty Miles within Land. And they were
not so much as provided with Hammocks, or any other Carriages, but
forced to walk on foot in the scorching Sun, which had like to have
kill’d them.

Upon their appearing before the King, Captain _More_ complained
of his hard usage; telling his Majesty, “They had had no Victuals
nor any Refreshment since they had been taken Prisoners.” The King
thereupon rose up, and went into an inner room; whence coming out
again with a Hatchet in his Hand, the sight of it so frightned some
of the _Portuguese_, that they fell on their Knees to implore his
Mercy; imagining their Heads were going to be cut off. But Captain
_More_ severely upbraiding them for their cowardly Behaviour, so
disgraceful to white Men, they rose up: And had soon after the
pleasure of seeing a small Cask of Beef opened with it, and several
pieces ordered to be dress’d for them. This Cask of Beef, it seems,
was found by the Soldiers in the Captain’s Factory, and sent up with
other Plunder, to the King, the day before.

Then they were distributed according to their different Nations,
and put under the care of several great Men. Captain _More_ and his
People were delivered to _Allegee_ the _English_ Cabocier; (as he
was termed) that is, the Person appointed to Trade with them in
particular. This black Gentleman treated them with great Civility;
but they had the Mortification, a few days after, to hear, he was
seized and beheaded; tho’ they could never learn the Cause.

It seems the King of _Dahomè_ is grown exceedingly cruel towards his
People, being always suspicious, that Plots and Conspiracies are
carrying on against him: So that he frequently cuts off some of his
great Men on bare Surmises. This, added to the many Disappointments
he has met with from the _J-oes_, has so soured his Temper, that
he is likewise greatly altered towards the _Europeans_, as Captain
_More_ experienced. For this Gentleman had been at his Camp formerly,
and was known to him soon after the Conquest of _Whidaw_, as I have
related in the former part of this Book.

Besides, both King and People continue as savage as ever, tho’ they
have conversed for several Years past with white Men. For one day
the Council having begged a Captive, his Majesty readily gave them
one, whom they killed and feasted on.

But to return to Captain _More_. He and the other _Europeans_ having
continued a good while Prisoners, Mr. _Dean_, the _African_ Company’s
Governor of the Fort at _Whidaw_, came to _Ardra_, and interceded
with the King for them: Representing, “As they had been at _Jaqueen_
only on account of Trade, it was very unjust to detain them.” With
these and many other Arguments, he at last obtained their Freedom:
And a Guard was ordered to see Captain _More_ safe down to _Jaqueen_.
But he reflecting on the hard usage he had received at that place
from the Soldiers, when at first taken Prisoner; and that they still
were encamped there, he chose to go by the way of _Whidaw_: From
whence he got on board a _French_ Ship, and borrowed their Boat,
which carried him to his own Ship, that lay in the Road of _Jaqueen_.

From this and the foregoing Account the Reader may observe, that
now all the Countries near the Sea side, which the King of _Dahomè_
could possibly get at, are not only conquered, but also turned into
Desolation, with the Inland Parts, in so terrible a manner, that
there is no Prospect of Trade’s reviving there again for many Years,
or at least so long as the Conqueror lives. What little there is, is
carried on chiefly at _Appah_, a place secured from him by a Morass
and a River.


                        _The End of_ BOOK I.




                              BOOK II.

  _The manner how the Negroes become Slaves. The Numbers of them
  yearly exported from_ Guinea _to_ America. _The Lawfulness of
  that Trade. Mutinies among them on board the Ships where the
  Author has been_, &c.


Before I give a particular Relation of the several _Mutinies_ among
the Negroe Slaves, whereof I have been a Witness, and which is to
be the chief Subject of this present Book, it will be very proper
to prefix a short account of the _Manner_ how the _Negroes_ become
Slaves; what _Numbers_ of them are yearly exported from _Guinea_;
and then offer a few words in Justification of that Trade.

[Sidenote: The manner how the Negroes become Slaves.]

As for the _Manner_ how those People become Slaves; it may be reduced
under these several Heads.

1. It has been the Custom among the _Negroes_, time out of Mind, and
is so to this day, for them to make Slaves of all the Captives they
take in War. Now, before they had an Opportunity of selling them to
the white People, they were often obliged to kill great Multitudes,
when they had taken more than they could well employ in their own
Plantations, for fear they should rebel, and endanger their Masters
Safety.

_2dly._ Most Crimes amongst them are punished by Mulcts and Fines;
and if the Offender has not wherewithal to pay his Fine, he is sold
for a Slave: This is the Practice of the inland People, as well as of
those on the Sea side.

_3dly._ Debtors who refuse to pay their Debts, or are insolvent,
are likewise liable to be made Slaves; but their Friends may redeem
them; And if they are not able or willing to do it, then they
are generally sold for the Benefit of their Creditors. But few of
these come into the hands of the _Europeans_, being kept by their
Countrymen for their own use.

_4thly._ I have been told, That it is common for some inland People,
to sell their Children for Slaves, tho’ they are under no Necessity
for so doing; which I am inclined to believe. But I never observed,
that the People near the Sea Coast practise this, unless compelled
thereto by extreme Want and Famine, as the People of _Whidaw_ have
lately been.

[Sidenote: Number of Negroes exported.]

Now, by these means it is that so many of the Negroes become
Slaves, and more especially by being taken Captives in War. Of
these the Number is so great, that I may safely affirm, without any
Exaggeration, that the _Europeans_ of all Nations, that trade to the
Coast of _Guinea_, have, in some Years, exported at least seventy
thousand. And tho’ this may no doubt be thought at first hearing a
prodigious Number; yet when ’tis considered how great the Extent
of this Coast is, namely from _Cape Verd_ to _Angola_, which is
about four thousand Miles in length; and that _Polygamy_ is allowed
in general amongst them, by which means the Countries are full of
People, I hope it will not be thought improbable that so many are
yearly exported from thence.

[Sidenote: Lawfulness of that Trade.]

Several Objections have often been raised against the Lawfulness
of this Trade, which I shall not here undertake to refute. I shall
only observe in general That tho’ to traffick in human Creatures,
may at first sight appear barbarous, inhuman, and unnatural; yet the
Traders herein have as much to plead in their own Excuse, as can be
said for some other Branches of Trade, namely, the _Advantage_ of it:
And that not only in regard of the Merchants, but also of the Slaves
themselves, as will plainly appear from these following Reasons.

First, It is evident, that abundance of Captives, taken in War, would
be inhumanly destroyed, was there not an Opportunity of disposing of
them to the _Europeans_. So that at least many Lives are saved, and
great Numbers of useful Persons kept in being.

Secondly, When they are carried to the Plantations, they generally
live much better there, than they ever did in their own Country; for
as the Planters pay a great price for them, ’tis their interest to
take care of them.

Thirdly, By this means the _English_ Plantations have been so much
improved, that ’tis almost incredible, what great Advantages have
accrued to the Nation thereby; especially to the _Sugar Islands_,
which lying in a Climate near as hot as the Coast of _Guinea_, the
_Negroes_ are fitter to cultivate the Lands there, than white People.

Then as to the Criminals amongst the _Negroes_, they are by this
means effectually transported, never to return again; a Benefit which
we very much want here.

In a word, from this Trade proceed Benefits, far outweighing all,
either real or pretended Mischiefs and Inconveniencies. And, let
the worst that can, be said of it, it will be found, like all other
earthly Advantages, tempered with a mixture of Good and Evil.

[Sidenote: Mutinies among the Negroes, in the Ships where the Author
has been.]

I come now to give an Account of the Mutinies that have happened on
board the Ships where I have been.

These Mutinies are generally occasioned by the Sailors ill usage
of these poor People, when on board the Ships wherein they are
transported to our Plantations. Wherever therefore I have commanded,
it has been my principal Care, to have the _Negroes_ on board my
Ship kindly used; and I have always finally charged my white People
to treat them with Humanity and Tenderness; In which I have usually
found my Account, both in keeping them from mutinying, and preserving
them in health.

And whereas it may seem strange to those that are unacquainted with
the method of managing them, how we can carry so many hundreds
together in a small Ship, and keep them in order; I shall just
mention what is generally practised. When we purchase grown People,
I acquaint them by the Interpreter, “That, now they are become my
Property, I think fit to let them know what they are bought for,
that they may be easy in their Minds:” (For these poor People are
generally under terrible Apprehensions upon their being bought by
white Men, many being afraid that we design to eat them; which, I
have been told, is a story much credited by the inland _Negroes_;)
“So after informing them, That they are bought to till the Ground in
our Country, with several other Matters; I then acquaint them, how
they are to behave themselves on board, towards the white Men; that
if any one abuses them, they are to complain to the Linguist, who is
to inform me of it, and I will do them Justice: But if they make a
Disturbance, or offer to strike a white Man, they must expect to be
severely punished.”

When we purchase the _Negroes_, we couple the sturdy Men together
with Irons; but we suffer the Women and Children to go freely about:
And soon after we have sail’d from the Coast, we undo all the Mens
Irons.

They are fed twice a day, and are allowed in fair Weather to come
on Deck at seven a clock in the Morning, and to remain there, if
they think proper, till Sun setting. Every _Monday_ Morning they
are served with Pipes and Tobacco, which they are very fond of. The
Men _Negroes_ lodge separate from the Women and Children; and the
places where they all lye are cleaned every day, some white Men being
appointed to see them do it.

It would be tedious to the Reader as well as to my self, should I
relate all the Particulars of our Management of them, and the Care
we take to keep them in health and order; wherefore I shall conclude
with this remark, That if a Commander is himself well inclined, and
has good Officers to execute his Orders, the Negroes on board may
be easily governed; and many Difficulties (which unavoidably arise
amongst such Numbers) got over with a little trouble.

The first Mutiny I saw among the _Negroes_, happened during my first
Voyage, in the Year 1704. It was on board the _Eagle Galley_ of
_London_, commanded by my Father, with whom I was as Purser. We
had bought our Negroes in the River of _Old Callabar_ in the Bay
of _Guinea_. At the time of their mutinying we were in that River,
having four hundred of them on board, and not above ten white Men
who were able to do Service: For several of our Ship’s Company were
dead, and many more sick; besides, two of our Boats were just then
gone with twelve People on Shore to fetch Wood, which lay in sight
of the Ship. All these Circumstances put the _Negroes_ on consulting
how to mutiny, which they did at four a clock in the Afternoon, just
as they went to Supper. But as we had always carefully examined the
Mens Irons, both Morning and Evening, none had got them off, which
in a great measure contributed to our Preservation. Three white Men
stood on the Watch with Cutlaces in their Hands. One of them who was
on the Forecastle, a stout fellow, seeing some of the Men Negroes
take hold of the chief Mate, in order to throw him over board, he
laid on them so heartily with the flat side of his Cutlace, that
they soon quitted the Mate, who escaped from them, and run on the
Quarter-Deck to get Arms. I was then sick with an Ague, and lying on
a Couch in the great Cabbin, the Fit being just come on. However, I
no sooner heard the Outcry, _That the Slaves were mutinying_, but I
took two Pistols, and run on the Deck with them; where meeting with
my Father and the chief Mate, I delivered a Pistol to each of them.
Whereupon they went forward on the Booms, calling to the Negroe Men
that were on the Forecastle; but they did not regard their Threats,
being busy with the Centry, (who had disengaged the chief Mate,) and
they would have certainly killed him with his own Cutlace, could they
have got it from him; but they could not break the Line wherewith the
Handle was fastened to his Wrist. And so, tho’ they had seized him,
yet they could not make use of his Cutlace. Being thus disappointed,
they endeavoured to throw him overboard, but he held so fast by one
of them that they could not do it. My Father seeing this stout Man
in so much Danger, ventured amongst the _Negroes_, to save him; and
fired his Pistol over their Heads, thinking to frighten them. But
a lusty Slave struck him with a Billet so hard, that he was almost
stunned. The Slave was going to repeat the Blow, when a young Lad
about seventeen years old, whom we had been kind to, interposed his
Arm, and received the Blow, by which his Arm-bone was fractured. At
the same instant the Mate fired his Pistol, and shot the _Negroe_
that had struck my Father. At the sight of this the Mutiny ceased,
and all the Men-negroes on the Forecastle threw themselves flat on
their Faces, crying out for Mercy.

Upon examining into the matter, we found, there were not above twenty
Men Slaves concerned in this Mutiny; and the two Ringleaders were
missing, having, it seems, jumped overboard as soon as they found
their Project defeated, and were drowned. This was all the Loss we
suffered on this occasion: For the _Negroe_ that was shot by the
Mate, the Surgeon, beyond all Expectation, cured. And I had the good
Fortune to lose my Ague, by the fright and hurry I was put into.
Moreover, the young Man, who had received the Blow on his Arm to save
my Father, was cured by the Surgeon in our Passage to _Virginia_.
At our Arrival in that place we gave him his Freedom; and a worthy
Gentleman, one Colonel _Carter_, took him into his Service, till he
became well enough acquainted in the Country to provide for himself.

I have been several Voyages, when there has been no Attempt made
by our Negroes to mutiny; which, I believe, was owing chiefly, to
their being kindly used, and to my Officers Care in keeping a good
Watch. But sometimes we meet with stout stubborn People amongst them,
who are never to be made easy; and these are generally some of the
_Cormantines_, a Nation of the _Gold Coast_. I went in the year 1721,
in the _Henry_ of _London_, a Voyage to that part of the _Coast_, and
bought a good many of these People. We were obliged to secure them
very well in irons, and watch them narrowly: Yet they nevertheless
mutinied, tho’ they had little prospect of succeeding. I lay at that
time near a place called _Mumfort_ on the _Gold-Coast_, having near
five hundred Negroes on board, three hundred of which were Men. Our
Ship’s Company consisted of fifty white People, all in health: And I
had very good Officers; so that I was very easy in all respects.

This Mutiny began at Midnight (the Moon then shining very bright) in
this manner. Two Men that stood Centry at the Fore-hatch way, where
the Men Slaves came up to go to the house of Office, permitted four
to go to that place; but neglected to lay the Gratings again, as they
should have done: Whereupon four more Negroes came on Deck, who had
got their Irons off, and the four in the house of Office having done
the same, all the eight fell on the two Centries, who immediately
called out for help. The Negroes endeavoured to get their Cutlaces
from them, but the Lineyards (that is the Lines by which the handles
of the Cutlaces were fastned to the Mens Wrists) were so twisted in
the Scuffle, that they could not get them off before we came to their
Assistance. The Negroes perceiving several white Men coming towards
them, with Arms in their hands, quitted the Centries, and jumped over
the Ship’s side into the Sea.

I being by this time come forward on the Deck, my first care was to
secure the Gratings, to prevent any more Negroes from coming up; and
then I ordered People to get into the Boat, and save those that had
jumped over-board, which they luckily did: For they found them all
clinging to the Cables the Ship was moored by.

After we had secured these People, I called the Linguists, and
ordered them to bid the Men-Negroes between Decks be quiet; (for
there was a great noise amongst them.) On their being silent, I
asked, “What had induced them to mutiny?” They answered, “I was a
great Rogue to buy them, in order to carry them away from their own
Country; and that they were resolved to regain their Liberty if
possible.” I replied, “That they had forfeited their Freedom before
I bought them, either by Crimes, or by being taken in War, according
to the Custom of their Country; and they being now my Property, I was
resolved to let them feel my Resentment, if they abused my Kindness:
Asking at the same time, Whether they had been ill used by the
white Men, or had wanted for any thing the Ship afforded?” To this
they replied, “They had nothing to complain of.” Then I observed to
them, “That if they should gain their Point and escape to the Shore,
it would be no Advantage to them, because their Countrymen would
catch them, and sell them to other Ships.” This served my purpose,
and they seemed to be convinced of their Fault, begging, “I would
forgive them, and promising for the future to be obedient, and never
mutiny again, if I would not punish them this time.” This I readily
granted, and so they went to sleep. When Daylight came we called the
Men Negroes up on Deck, and examining their Irons, found them all
secure. So this Affair happily ended, which I was very glad of; for
these People are the stoutest and most sensible _Negroes_ on the
Coast: Neither are they so weak as to imagine as others do, that we
buy them to eat them; being satisfied we carry them to work in our
Plantations, as they do in their own Country.

However, a few days after this, we discovered they were plotting
again, and preparing to mutiny. For some of the Ringleaders proposed
to one of our Linguists, If he could procure them an Ax, they would
cut the Cables the Ship rid by in the night; and so on her driving
(as they imagined) ashore, they should get out of our hands, and then
would become his Servants as long as they lived.

For the better understanding of this I must observe here, that these
Linguists are Natives and Freemen of the Country, whom we hire on
account of their speaking good _English_, during the time we remain
trading on the Coast; and they are likewise Brokers between us and
the black Merchants.

This Linguist was so honest as to acquaint me with what had been
proposed to him; and advised me to keep a strict Watch over the
Slaves: For tho’ he had represented to them the same as I had done
on their mutinying before, That they would be all catch’d again, and
sold to other Ships, in case they could carry their Point, and get on
Shore; yet it had no effect upon them.

This gave me a good deal of Uneasiness. For I knew several Voyages
had proved unsuccessful by Mutinies; as they occasioned either the
total loss of the Ship and the white Mens Lives; or at least by
rendring it absolutely necessary to kill or wound a great number
of the Slaves, in order to prevent a total Destruction. Moreover,
I knew many of these _Cormantine_ Negroes despised Punishment, and
even Death it self: It having often happened at _Barbadoes_ and other
Islands, that on their being any ways hardly dealt with, to break
them of their Stubbornness in refusing to work, twenty or more have
hang’d themselves at a time in a Plantation. However, about a Month
after this, a sad Accident happened, that brought our Slaves to be
more orderly, and put them in a better Temper: And it was this. On
our going from _Mumfort_ to _Annamaboe_, which is the principal part
on the _Gold Coast_, I met there with another of my Owner’s Ships,
called the _Elizabeth_. One Captain _Thompson_ that commanded her
was dead; as also his chief Mate: Moreover the Ship had afterwards
been taken at Cape _Lahoe_ on the windward Coast, by _Roberts_
the Pirate, with whom several of the Sailors belonging to her had
entered. However, some of the Pirates had hindered the Cargoe’s being
plundered, and obtained that the Ship should be restored to the
second Mate: Telling him, “They did it out of respect to the generous
Character his Owner bore, in doing good to poor Sailors.”

When I met with this Vessel I had almost disposed of my Ship’s
Cargoe; and the _Elizabeth_ being under my Direction, I acquainted
the second Mate, who then commanded her, That I thought it for
our Owner’s Interest, to take the Slaves from on board him, being
about 120, into my Ship; and then go off the Coast; and that I would
deliver him at the same time the Remains of my Cargoe, for him to
dispose of with his own after I was sailed. This he readily complied
with, but told me, “He feared his Ship’s Company would mutiny, and
oppose my taking the Slaves from him:” And indeed, they came at that
instant in a Body on the Quarter-deck; where one spoke for the rest,
telling me plainly, “they would not allow the Slaves to be taken out
by me.” I found by this they had lost all respect for their present
Commander, who indeed was a weak Man. However, I calmly asked the
reason, “Why they offered to oppose my taking the Slaves?” To which
they answered, “I had no business with them.” On this I desired
the Captain to send to his Scrutore, for the Book of Instructions
Captain _Thompson_ had received from our Owner; and he read to them,
at my request, that Part, in which their former Captain, or his
Successor (in case of Death) was to follow my Orders. Hereupon they
all cried out, “they should remain a great while longer on the Coast
to purchase more Slaves, if I took these from them, which they were
resolved to oppose.” I answered, “That such of the Ship’s Company as
desired it, I would receive on board my own; where they should have
the same Wages they had at present on board the _Elizabeth_, and I
would send some of my own People to supply their Places.” This so
reasonable an Offer was refused, one of the Men who was the Ship’s
Cooper telling me, that the Slaves had been on board a long time,
and they had great Friendship with them: therefore they would keep
them. I asked him, “Whether he had ever been on the Coast of _Guinea_
before?” He replied no. Then I told him. “I supposed he had not by
his way of talking, and advised him not to rely on the Friendship of
the Slaves, which he might have reason to repent of when too late.”
And ’tis remarkable this very person was killed by them the next
Night, as shall be presently related.

So finding that reasoning with these Men was to no Purpose, I told
them, “When I came with my Boats to fetch the Slaves, they should
find me as resolute to chastise such of them as should dare to oppose
me, as I had been condescending to convince them by arguing calmly.”
So I took my leave of their Captain, telling him, “I would come next
Morning to finish the Affair.”

But that very Night, which was near a month after the Mutiny on
board of us at _Mumfort_, the Moon shining now very bright, as it
did then, we heard, about ten a Clock, two or three Musquets fired
on board the _Elizabeth_. Upon that I ordered all our Boats to be
manned, and having secured every thing in our Ship, to prevent our
Slaves from mutinying, I went my self in our Pinnace, (the other
Boats following me) on board the _Elizabeth_. In our way we saw two
Negroes swimming from her, but before we could reach them with our
Boats, some _Sharks_ rose from the bottom, and tore them in Pieces.
We came presently along the side of the Ship, where we found two
Men-Negroes holding by a Rope, with their Heads just above water;
they were afraid, it seems, to swim from the Ship’s side, having
seen their Companions devoured just before by the Sharks. These two
Slaves we took into our Boat, and then went into the Ship, where we
found the Negroes very quiet, and all under Deck; but the Ship’s
Company was on the Quarter-deck, in a great Confusion, saying, “The
Cooper, who had been placed centry at the Fore-hatch way, over the
Men-Negroes, was, they believed, kill’d by them.” I was surprized
to hear this, wondring that these cowardly fellows, who had so
vigorously opposed my taking the Slaves out, a few hours before, had
not Courage enough to venture forward, to save their Ship-mate; but
had secured themselves by shutting the Quarter-deck-door, where they
all stood with Arms in their Hands. So I went to the fore-part of
the Ship with some of my People, and there we found the Cooper lying
on his back quite dead, his Scull being cleft asunder with a Hatchet
that lay by him. At the sight of this I called for the Linguist, and
bid him ask the _Negroes_ between Decks, “Who had killed the white
Man?” They answered, “They knew nothing of the matter; for there had
been no design of mutinying amongst them:” Which upon Examination we
found true; for above one hundred of the Negroes then on board, being
bought to Windward, did not understand a word of the _Gold-Coast_
Language, and so had not been in the Plot. But this Mutiny was
contrived by a few _Cormantee-Negroes_, who had been purchased about
two or three days before. At last, one of the two Men-Negroes we had
taken up along the Ship side, impeached his Companion, and he readily
confessed he had kill’d the Cooper, with no other View, but that he
and his Countrymen might escape undiscovered by swimming on Shore.
For on their coming upon Deck, they observed, that all the white
Men set to watch were asleep; and having found the Cook’s Hatchet by
the Fire-place, he took it up, not designing then to do any Mischief
with it; but passing by the Cooper, who was centry, and he beginning
to awake, the Negroe rashly struck him on the head with it, and then
jump’d overboard. Upon this frank Confession, the white Men would
have cut him to Pieces; but I prevented it, and carried him to my
own Ship. Early the next morning, I went on board the _Elizabeth_
with my Boats, and sent away all the Negroes then in her, into my
own Ship: not one of the other Ship’s Company offering to oppose it.
Two of them, the Carpenter and Steward, desired to go with me, which
I readily granted; and by way of Security for the future Success of
the Voyage, I put my chief Mate, and four of my under Officers (with
their own Consent,) on board the _Elizabeth_; and they arrived, about
five Months after this, at _Jamaica_, having disposed of most part of
the Cargoe.

After having sent the Slaves out of the _Elizabeth_, as I have
just now mentioned, I went on board my own Ship; and there being
then in the Road of _Anamaboe_, eight sail of Ships besides us, I
sent an Officer in my Boat to the Commanders of them, “To desire
their Company on board my Ship, because I had an Affair of great
Consequence to communicate to them.” Soon after, most of them
were pleased to come; and I having acquainted them with the whole
Matter, and they having also heard the Negroe’s Confession, “That
he had killed the white Man;” They unanimously advised me to put
him to death; arguing, “That Blood required Blood, by all Laws both
divine and human; especially as there was in this Case the clearest
Proof, namely the Murderer’s Confession: Moreover this would in all
probability prevent future Mischiefs; for by publickly executing this
Person at the Ship’s Fore-yard Arm, the Negroes on board their Ships
would see it; and as they were very much disposed to mutiny, it might
prevent them from attempting it.” These Reasons, with my being in
the same Circumstances, made me comply.

Accordingly we acquainted the Negroe, that he was to die in an hour’s
time for murdering the white Man. He answered, “He must confess it
was a rash Action in him to kill him; but he desired me to consider,
that if I put him to death, I should lose all the Money I had paid
for him.” To this I bid the Interpreter reply, “That tho’ I knew it
was customary in his Country to commute for Murder by a Sum of Money,
yet it was not so with us; and he should find that I had no regard to
my Profit in this respect: For as soon as an Hour-Glass, just then
turned, was run out, he should be put to death;” At which I observed
he shewed no Concern.

Hereupon the other Commanders went on board their respective
Ships, in order to have all their Negroes upon Deck at the time of
Execution, and to inform them of the occasion of it. The Hour-Glass
being run out, the Murderer was carried on the Ship’s Forecastle,
where he had a Rope fastened under his Arms, in order to be hoisted
up to the Fore-yard Arm, to be shot to death. This some of his
Countrymen observing, told him, (as the Linguist informed me
afterwards) “That they would not have him be frightened; for it was
plain I did not design to put him to death, otherwise the Rope would
have been put about his neck, to hang him.” For it seems they had
no thought of his being shot; judging he was only to be hoisted up
to the Yard-arm, in order to scare him: But they immediately saw
the contrary; for as soon as he was hoisted up, ten white Men who
were placed behind the Barricado on the Quarter-deck, fired their
Musquets, and instantly killed him. This struck a sudden Damp upon
our Negroe-Men, who thought, that, on account of my Profit, I would
not have executed him.

The Body being let down upon the Deck, the Head was cut off, and
thrown overboard. This last part was done, to let our Negroes see,
that all who offended thus, should be served in the same manner. For
many of the Blacks believe, that if they are put to death and not
dismembred, they shall return again to their own Country, after they
are thrown overboard. But neither the Person that was executed, nor
his Countrymen of _Cormantee_ (as I understood afterwards,) were so
weak as to believe any such thing; tho’ many I had on board from
other Countries had that Opinion.

When the Execution was over, I ordered the Linguist to acquaint the
Men-Negroes, “That now they might judge, no one that killed a white
Man should be spared:” And I thought proper now to acquaint them once
for all, “That if they attempted to mutiny again, I should be obliged
to punish the Ringleaders with death, in order to prevent further
Mischief.” Upon this they all promised to be obedient, and I assured
them they should be kindly used, if they kept their Promise: which
they faithfully did. For we sailed, two days after, from _Anamaboe_
for _Jamaica_; and tho’ they were on board near four Months, from our
going off the Coast, till they were sold at that Island, they never
gave us the least reason to be jealous of them; which doubtless was
owing to the Execution of the white Man’s Murderer.

These three Mutinies, I have here related, are all that ever happened
where I was present, tho’ I have gone many Voyages to the Coast of
_Guinea_. But I have heard of several, that have ended in a very
tragical manner. However to avoid being tedious, I shall relate only
one, which is very remarkable, and happen’d on board the _Ferrers
Galley_ of _London_ Capt. _Messervy_; who by his over-care, and too
great Kindness to the _Negroes_ on board his Ship, was destroyed by
them, and the Voyage at last came to nothing. I met this Gentleman
at _Anamaboe_ on the Coast of _Guinea_, in _January_ 1722. At his
coming on board my Ship, he informed me of his good fortune, in that
he had purchased near 300 Negroes in a few Days, at a place called
_Cetre-Crue_, on the windward part of the Coast of _Guinea_; which
happened in this manner.

It seems the Inhabitants of this place, which lies near the Sea-side,
had been often misused by some inland People, who for a long time
had treated them in a villainous manner, whenever they went to their
Towns with Salt, or any other Commodities to sell. For knowing the
People of _Cetre-Crue_, did in a great measure depend on them for
their Food, which is Rice, they took their Commodities, and gave
them just what quantity of Rice they pleased, in exchange. The
_Cetre-Crues_ having long complained of this Injury, without redress,
resolved to bear it no longer, but to revenge themselves by Arms.
And they were crowned with Success, destroying and taking all the
Inhabitants of the principal Town where they used to go and buy Rice.

Captain _Messervy_ happened to anchor near _Cetre-Crue_ just at
that time, and had the opportunity of purchasing a great many of
the Captives at an easy rate. For the Conquerors were glad to get
something for them at that instant, since if a Ship had not been in
the Road, they would have been obliged to have killed most of the
Men-Captives, for their own Security.

After the Captain had told me this story, he desired me to spare him
some Rice, having heard, I had purchased a great many Tuns to the
Windward; where he had bought little, not expecting to meet with so
many Slaves. This request I could not comply with, having provided no
more than was necessary for my self, and for another of my Owner’s
Ships, which I quickly expected. And understanding from him, that he
had never been on the Coast of _Guinea_ before, I took the liberty to
observe to him, “That as he had on board so many Negroes of one Town
and Language, it required the utmost Care and Management to keep them
from mutinying; and that I was sorry he had so little Rice for them:
For I had experienced that the Windward Slaves are always very fond
of it, it being their usual Food in their own Country and he might
certainly expect dissatisfactions and Uneasiness amongst them for
want of a sufficient quantity.”

This he took kindly, and having asked my Advice about other Matters,
took his leave, inviting me to come next day to see him. I went
accordingly on board his Ship, about three a clock in the afternoon.
At four a clock the Negroes went to Supper, and Captain _Messervy_
desired me to excuse him for a quarter of an hour, whilst he went
forward to see the Men-Negroes served with Victuals. I observed from
the Quarter-Deck, that he himself put Pepper and Palm Oyl amongst
the Rice they were going to eat. When he came back to me, I could
not forbear observing to him, “How imprudent it was in him to do
so: For tho’ it was proper for a Commander sometimes to go forward,
and observe how things were managed; yet he ought to take a proper
time, and have a good many of his white People in Arms when he went;
or else the having him so much in their Power, might incourage the
Slaves to mutiny: For he might depend upon it, they always aim at the
chief Person in the Ship, whom they soon distinguish by the respect
shown him by the rest of the People.”

He thanked me for this Advice, but did not seem to relish it;
saying, “He thought the old Proverb good, that _The Master’s Eye
makes the Horse fat_.” We then fell into other Discourse, and among
other things he told me, “He designed to go away in a few days:”
Accordingly he sailed three days after for _Jamaica_. Some Months
after I went for that place, where at my arrival I found his Ship,
and had the following melancholy account of his Death, which happened
about ten days after he left the coast of _Guinea_ in this manner.

Being on the Forecastle of the Ship, amongst the Men-Negroes, when
they were eating their Victuals, they laid hold on him, and beat out
his Brains with the little Tubs, out of which they eat their boiled
Rice. This Mutiny having been plotted amongst all the grown Negroes
on board, they run from the fore-part of the Ship in a body, and
endeavoured to force the Barricado on the Quarter-Deck, not regarding
the Musquets or Half Pikes, that were presented to their Breasts by
the white Men, through the Loop-holes. So that at last the chief
Mate was obliged to order one of the Quarter-deck Guns laden with
Partridge-Shot, to be fired amongst them; which occasioned a terrible
Destruction: For there were near eighty _Negroes_ kill’d and drowned,
many jumping overboard when the Gun was fired. This indeed put an
end to the Mutiny, but most of the Slaves that remained alive grew
so sullen, that several of them were starved to death, obstinately
refusing to take any Sustenance: And after the Ship was arrived at
_Jamaica_, they attempted twice to mutiny, before the Sale of them
began. This with their former Misbehaviour coming to be publickly
known, none of the Planters cared to buy them, tho’ offered at a low
Price. So that this proved a very unsuccessful Voyage, for the Ship
was detained many Months at _Jamaica_ on that account, and at last
was lost there in a Hurricane.


                        _The End of_ BOOK II.

                  [Illustration: (decorative icon)]




                              BOOK III.

  _Containing an Account of the Author’s being taken by Pirates, on
  the North part of the Coast of_ Guinea, _in the_ Bird Galley _of_
  London, _belonging to the late_ Humphrey Morrice _Esq; who was
  sole Owner of the said Ship. Interspersed with several Instances
  of the Author’s many Deliverances, and narrow Escapes from Death,
  during the time he was detain’d Prisoner by the Pirates._


In the beginning of _November_, in the Year 1718, the late _Humphrey
Morrice_ Esq; Merchant of _London_, appointed me Commander of the
_Bird Galley_, and gave me Orders to go to _Holland_, to take on
board a Cargoe for the Coast of _Africa_: Having so done, we were
unfortunately detained by contrary Winds, at _Helvoet-Sluys_, till
the 10th day of _December_, when a violent Storm arose, and in the
night following forc’d our Ship on Shore, with several others. The
Ship, by the Strength of the Wind, and height of the Tide, was
carried with a great force against the Dike, or Bank that secures
the Land from being overflowed on such high Tides, which frightened
the Inhabitants thereabouts not a little. Moreover, the Waves made
her work so much on the Ground where she was stranded, that when the
Tide had left her, we found she set seven foot deep abaft in the
Strand; but had the Satisfaction to find, on Examination, the Ship
had received no damage in her bottom. Having unloaded, and hired many
Boors or Peasants, to dig a Trench of near 300 Foot in length to the
low water mark, we waited some time for a high Tide; and then getting
the Ship off, carried her into _Helvoet-Sluys_ Peer.

Having refitted and loaded again, we proceeded on our Voyage the
latter end of _January_; but the Wind changing by the time we were
off the Isle of _Wight_, and rising to a great Storm westerly, we
were forced into _Spithead_; where having lain some time, we sailed
again with a fair Wind, which carried us above 70 Leagues to the
westward of the _Lizard_. Here a severe Storm of Wind coming up at
Southwest, obliged us to lye by, under a reef’d Mainsail; and it
increased to such a violent Degree, that we expected to be swallowed
up every Minute, by the great Sea which ran Mountains high; but
it pleased God, that after 24 Hours, it began to abate, and we
received no other damage, than the loss of the _Lyon_ from the Ship’s
Cut-water, which was washed away by the Sea.

The Wind (after this Storm) remaining contrary a long time, with
frequent hard Gales, obliged us at last to go for _Kingsale_ in
_Ireland_: Where having lain a few days, and repaired the Ship’s
Head, with other things that were out of Order, we sailed from that
place, with a northerly Wind, the 10th day of _March_ 1718-19, and
had a short and fine Passage to the River _Sieraleon_; on the North
Coast of _Guinea_, in the Latitude of 8 Deg. 30 Min. where we arrived
the first day of _April_ 1719: We met with nothing remarkable in our
Passage, except, that near the _Canary Islands_, we were chased by a
Ship whom we judged to be a _Sallec-Rover_; but our Ship outsailing
her, they soon gave over the Chase.

There were, at the time of our unfortunate Arrival in the above
mentioned River, three Pirate Ships, who had then taken ten _English_
Ships in that place. As it is necessary for illustrating this Story,
to give an Account how these three Ships came to meet there, I must
observe, That the first of them which arrived in the River, was
called the _Rising Sun_, one _Cocklyn_ Commander, who had not with
him above 25 Men. These having been with one Captain _Moody_, a
famous Pirate, some Months before, in a _Brigantine_, which sailed
very well, and took the _Rising Sun_, they were _morooned_ by him,
(as they call it) that is forced on board that Ship, and deprived
of their share of the Plunder, taken formerly by the _Brigantine_.
These People being obliged to go away in her, with little Provision
and Ammunition, chose _Cocklyn_ for their Commander, and made for
the River _Sieraleon_; where arriving, they surprized in his Sloop,
one _Segnor Joseph_, a black Gentleman, who had been formerly in
_England_, and was a Person of good account in this Country. This
Man’s Ransom procured the Pirates a sufficient supply of Provision
and Ammunition. Moreover, several _Bristol_ and other Ships arriving
soon after, were likewise taken; and many of their People entring
with the Pirates, they had, when I fell into their hands, near 80 Men
in all.

The Crue of the _Brigantine_, who, with their Captain _Moody_, had
thus forced their Companions away in the _Rising Sun_, soon after
repenting of that Action, it bred great Discontents among them;
so that they quarrelled with their Captain and some others, whom
they thought the chief Promoters of it; and at last forced him,
with twelve others, into an open Boat, which they had taken a few
days before, from the _Spaniards_ of the _Canary Islands_; and as
they never were heard of afterwards, doubtless they perished in the
Ocean. After this, they chose one _Le Bouse_ a _Frenchman_ for their
Commander, who carried them to the River _Sieraleon_, where they
arrived about a Month after their parting with the _Rising Sun_.

At the first Appearance, of this Brigantine, _Cocklyn_ and his Crew
were under a great Surprize; but when they understood how _Moody_ and
some others had been served by them, they cheerfully joined their
Brethren in Iniquity.

On the same day also arrived one Captain _Davis_, who had been
pirating in a Sloop, and had taken a large Ship at the _Cape de Verd_
Islands. He coming into _Sieraleon_ with her, it put the other two
Pirates into some fear, believing at first it was a Man of War: But
upon discovering her black Flag at the Main-top mast-head, which
Pirate Ships usually hoist to terrify Merchant-Men; they were easy in
their Minds, and a little time after, saluted one another with their
Cannon.

This _Davis_ was a generous Man, and kept his Crew, which consisted
of near 150 Men, in good order; neither had he consorted or agreed
to join with the others, when I was taken by _Cocklyn_; which proved
a great Misfortune to me, as will appear afterwards. For I found
_Cocklyn_ and his Crew, to be a set of the basest and most cruel
Villains that ever were. And indeed they told me, after I was taken,
“That they chose him for their Commander, on account of his Brutality
and Ignorance; having resolved never to have again a Gentleman-like
Commander, as, they said, _Moody_ was.”

Upon mentioning this, I think it necessary to observe in this place,
that the Captain of a Pirate Ship, is chiefly chosen to fight
the Vessels they may meet with. Besides him, they chuse another
principal Officer, whom they call _Quarter-master_, who has the
general Inspection of all Affairs, and often controuls the Captain’s
Orders: This Person is also to be the first Man in boarding any Ship
they shall attack; or go in the Boat on any desperate Enterprize.
Besides the _Captain_ and _Quarter-master_, the Pirates had all other
Officers as is usual on board Men of War.

I come now to give an account how I was taken by them. The day that
I made the Land, when I was within three Leagues of the River’s
Mouth, it became calm in the Afternoon. Seeing a Smoke on Shore, I
sent for my first Mate Mr. _Simon Jones_, who had been formerly at
_Sieraleon_, where I had not; “bidding him take the Pinnace, and go
where the Smoke was, to enquire of the Natives, how Affairs stood
up the River.” But he replied, “it would be to little purpose, for
no People lived there: As to the Smoke we saw, he believed it might
be made by some Travellers who were roasting of Oysters on the
Shore; and would be gone before he could get a Mile from the Ship.
Moreover, as Night drew on, it would be difficult for him to find the
Ship again.” Thinking this answer reasonable, I did not press him
further; tho’ I understood afterwards, there was a Town where the
Smoke appeared. But I did not then in the least suspect Mr. _Jones_
would have proved such a Villain as he did afterwards.

About five a Clock in the Afternoon, a small Breeze arising from the
Sea, and the Tide of Flood setting strong, we stood for the River’s
Mouth. At Sun-setting we perceived a Ship at Anchor, a great way up
the River; which was the Pirate that took us soon after. The other
two Pirate Ships, with their Prizes, were hid from our sight by a
Point of Land.

It becoming calm about seven a Clock, and growing dark, we anchor’d
in the River’s Mouth; soon after which I went to Supper, with the
Officers that usually eat with me. About eight a Clock the Officer of
the Watch upon Deck, sent me word, “He heard the rowing of a Boat.”
Whereupon we all immediately went upon Deck; and the night being very
dark, I ordered Lanthorns and Candles to be got ready, supposing the
Boat might come from the Shore with some white Gentlemen, that lived
there as free Merchants; or else from the Ship we had seen up the
River a little while before we came to an Anchor. I ordered also,
by way of Precaution, the first Mate to go into the Steerage, to
put all things in order, and to send me forthwith twenty Men on the
_Quarter-deck_ with fire Arms and Cutlaces, which I thought he went
about.

As it was dark, I could not yet see the Boat, but heard the noise
of the rowing very plain: Whereupon I ordered the second Mate to
hail the Boat, to which the People in it answered, “They belonged
to the _Two Friends_, Captain _Eliot_ of _Barbadoes_.” At this, one
of the Officers who stood by me, said, “He knew the Captain very
well, and that he commanded a Vessel of that name.” I replied, “It
might be so; but I would not trust any Boat in such a place;” and
ordered him to hasten the first Mate, with the People and Arms upon
Deck, as I had just before ordered. By this time our Lanthorns and
Candles were brought up, and I ordered the Boat to be hailed again:
To which the People in it answered, “They were from _America_:” And
at the same time fired a volly of small Shot at the Ship, tho’ they
were then above Pistol shot from us; which showed the Boldness of
these Villains: For there was in the Boat only twelve of them, as I
understood afterwards, who knew nothing of the Strength of our Ship;
which was indeed considerable, we having 16 Guns, and 45 Men on
board. But as they told me after we were taken, “They judged we were
a small Vessel of little force. Moreover, they depended on the same
good fortune as in the other Ships they had taken; having met with no
resistance: For the People were generally glad of an opportunity of
entring with them:” Which last was but too true.

When they first began to fire, I called aloud to the first Mate, to
fire at the Boat out of the Steerage Port-holes; which not being
done, and the people I had ordered upon Deck with small Arms not
appearing, I was extremely surprized; and the more, when an Officer
came and told me, “The People would not take Arms.” I went thereupon
down into the Steerage, where I saw a great many of them looking at
one another. Little thinking that my first Mate had prevented them
from taking Arms, I asked them with some Roughness, “Why they had not
obeyed my Orders?” Calling upon some brisk Fellows by name, that had
gone a former Voyage with me, to defend the Ship; saying, “It would
be the greatest Reproach in the World to us all, if we should be
taken by a Boat.” Some of them replied, “They would have taken Arms,
but the Chest they were kept in could not be found.” The reason of
which will be related hereafter.

By this time the Boat was along the Ship’s Side, and there being no
body to oppose them, the Pirates immediately boarded us; and coming
on the Quarter-deck, fired their Pieces several times down into the
Steerage, and shot a Sailor in the Reins, of which Wound he died
afterwards. They likewise threw several Granado-shells, which burst
amongst us, so that ’tis a great wonder several of us were not killed
by them, or by their Shot.

At last some of our People bethought themselves to call out for
_Quarter_; which the Pirates granting, the _Quarter-master_ came down
into the Steerage, enquiring, “Where the Captain was?” I told him,
“I had been so till now.” Upon that he asked me, “How I durst order
my People to fire at their Boat out of the Steerage? saying, that
they had heard me repeat it several times.” I answered, “I thought
it my Duty to defend the Ship, if my People would have fought.” Upon
that he presented a Pistol to my Breast, which I had but just time
to parry before it went off; so that the Bullet past between my Side
and Arm. The Rogue finding he had not shot me, he turned the But-end
of the Pistol, and gave me such a Blow on the Head as stunned me;
so that I fell upon my Knees; but immediately recovering my self, I
forthwith jumped out of the Steerage upon the Quarter-deck, where the
Pirate Boatswain was.

He was a bloody Villain, having a few days before killed a poor
Sailor, because he did not do something so soon as he had ordered
him. This cruel Monster was asking some of my People, “Where their
Captain was.” So at my coming upon Deck, one of them, pointing to me,
said, “There he is.” Tho’ the night was very dark, yet there being
four Lanthorns with Candles, he had a full sight of me: Whereupon
lifting up his broad Sword, he swore, “No Quarter should be given
to any Captain that offered to defend his Ship,” aiming at the same
time a full stroke at my Head. To avoid it I stooped so low, that the
Quarter-deck Rail received the Blows and was cut in at least an inch
deep: Which happily saved my Head from being cleft asunder: And the
Sword breaking at the same time, with the force of the Blow on the
Rail, it prevented his cutting me to pieces.

By good Fortune his Pistols, that hung at his Girdle, were all
discharged; otherwise he would doubtless have shot me. But he took
one of them, and with the But-end endeavoured to beat out my Brains,
which some of my People that were then on the Quarter-deck observing,
cried out aloud, “For God’s sake don’t kill our Captain, for we never
were with a better Man.” This turned the Rage of him and two other
Pirates on my People, and saved my Life: But they cruelly used my
poor Men, cutting and beating them unmercifully. One of them had his
Chin almost cut off; and another received such a Wound on his Head,
that he fell on the Deck as dead; but afterwards, by the care of our
Surgeon he recovered.

All this happened in a few Minutes and the Quarter-master then coming
up ordered the Pirates to tie our People’s Hands, and told me, “That
when they boarded us, they let their Boat go adrift, and that I
must send an Officer with some of my People in our Boat to look for
theirs.” Whereupon my first Mate, Mr. _Simon Jones_, who stood by
offered to go: And the Quarter-master telling him, “He must return
quickly otherwise he should judge that they were run away with the
Boat, in order to go on Shore; and if they did so he would cut me to
pieces:” Mr. _Jones_ replied, “He would not stay above a quarter of
an Hour, but return whether he found the Boat or not.” Happily for me
he soon found her, and returned (tho’ it was very dark) in less time
than he had promised.

Then the Quarter-master took me by the hand, and told me, “My Life
was safe provided none of my People complained against me.” I
replied, “I was sure none of them could.”

The Pirates next, loaded all their small Arms, and fired several
Vollies for Joy they had taken us: Which their Comrades on board
their Ship hearing, it being then very near us, tho’ we could not
see it for the darkness of the Night, they concluded we had made
Resistance, and destroyed their People.

It will be proper to observe here, that soon after we had anchored
in the Mouth of the River _Sieraleon_, it became calm; and the Tide
of Ebb beginning to come down, the Pirates cut their Cable, and
let their Ship drive down with the Tide towards us, from the place
where we had seen her at anchor; having sometime before sent their
Boat against the Tide of Flood, to discover us. The Ship being by
that means come near us, and seeing our Lights, without asking
any Questions, gave us a Broad-side with their great Guns; verily
believing we had destroyed their Boat and People. This put the
Pirates on board us into Confusion, which I observing, asked the
Quarter-master, “Why he did not call with the speaking Trumpet, and
tell their Ship they had taken us?” Upon that he asked me angrily,
“Whether I was afraid of going to the Devil by a great Shot? For,
as to his part, he hoped he should be sent to Hell one of these
days by a Cannon Ball.” I answered, “I hoped that would not be my
Road.” However, he followed my Advice, and informed their Ship, “They
had taken a brave Prize, with all manner of good Liquors and fresh
Provisions on board.”

Just after this, _Cocklyn_, the Pirate Captain, ordered them to dress
a quantity of these Victuals; so they took many Geese, Turkeys,
Fowls and Ducks, making our People cut their Heads off, and pull the
great Feathers out of their Wings: But they would not stay till the
other Feathers were pick’d off. All these they put into our great
Furnace, which would boil Victuals for 500 Negroes, together with
several _Westphalia_ Hams, and a large Sow with Pig, which they
only bowelled, leaving the Hair on. This strange medley filled the
Furnace, and the Cook was ordered to boil them out of Hand.

As soon as the Pirate-ship had done firing, I asked the
Quarter-master’s leave, for our Surgeon to dress my poor People that
had been wounded; and I likewise went into the Steerage, to have
my Arm dress’d, it being very much bruised by the Blow given me by
the Pirate-Boatswain. Just after that, a person came to me from
the Quarter-master, desiring to know, “What a Clock it was by my
Watch?” Which judging to be a civil way of demanding it, I sent it
him immediately: desiring the Messenger to tell him, it was a very
good going Gold Watch. When it was delivered to the Quarter-master,
he held it up by the Chain, and presently laid it down on the Deck,
giving it a kick with his Foot; saying, “It was a pretty Foot-ball:”
On which, one of the Pirates caught it up, saying, “He would put it
in the common Chest to be sold at the Mast.”

I would not mention such trifling Circumstances; but that I judge
they serve to shew the Humours and Temper of these sort of People.

By this time I was loudly called upon to go on board the Pirate-ship.
As soon as I came upon Deck, they hurried me over our Ship’s
side into the Boat; but when we arrived along the side of the
Pirate-Vessel, I told them, “I was disabled in my Arm, and so desired
their help to get me into their Ship:” Which was readily done. Then
I was ordered to go on the Quarter-deck to their Commander, who
saluted me in this manner. “I am sorry you have met with bad usage
after Quarter given, but ’tis the Fortune of War sometimes. I expect
you will answer truly to all such Questions as I shall ask you:
otherwise you shall be cut to pieces; but if you tell the Truth, and
your Men make no Complaints against you, you shall be kindly used;
and this shall be the best Voyage you ever made in your Life, as you
shall find by what shall be given you.” I thanked him for his good
Intentions, telling him, “I was content to stand on the footing he
had proposed to me:”

Having answered all his Questions, one of which was, “How our Ship
sailed both large, and on a wind?” I replying, “Very well:” He then
threw up his Hat, saying, “She would make a fine Pirate Man of War.”
When I heard that, I must own I could not but be concern’d for having
answered so truly in that particular: But then considering, that some
of my People would no doubt have told them the same; and moreover, my
Journal, when they look’d into it, would have made it plainly appear,
which might have proved my Destruction, I satisfied my Mind with
these Reflections.

As, in this whole Affair, I greatly experienced the Providence
of Almighty God, in his Goodness delivering me from the hands of
these Villains, and from many Dangers; so the same good Providence
gave me such a presence of Mind, that when I believed I was upon
the point of being killed, such Terrors did not arise, as I had
formerly experienced, when in danger of Shipwrack. And tho’ I fared
very hard, and endured great Fatigues during the time I was there
Prisoner; yet praised be God, I enjoyed my Health: Submitting with
that Resignation to the Will of the Almighty, as a Man ought to do in
such severe Misfortunes.

But to return to my Narrative, which the Remembrance of my past
Dangers hath interrupted.

As soon as I had done answering the Captain’s Questions, a tall Man,
with four Pistols in his Girdle, and a broad Sword in his Hand,
came to me on the Quarter-deck, telling me, “His name was _James
Griffin_, and that we had been School-fellows.” Tho’ I remembred
him very well; yet having formerly heard, it had proved fatal to
some who had been taken by Pirates, to own any Knowledge of them; I
replied, “I could not remember any such Person by name.” Upon that
he mentioned some boyish Pranks that had formerly pass’d between us,
But I still denying any Knowledge of him, he told me, “He supposed I
took him to be one of the Pirate’s Crew, because I saw him armed in
that manner; but that he was a forc’d Man, and had been lately chief
Mate to Captain _James Creichton_ of _Bristol_; who was then, with
his Ship, in the Possession of the Pirates in the River, and had not
been destroyed by them, at his earnest intreaty: That since his being
forced, they had obliged him to act as Master of the Pirate-ship; and
the reason of his being so armed, was to prevent their imposing on
him; for there was hardly any amongst the Crew of Pirates belonging
to Captain _Cocklyn_, but what were cruel Villains; misusing much
better Men than themselves, only for having the Misfortune to fall
into their Hands, as I had already experienced, and might find
hereafter; but he would himself take care of me that night, in which
would be my greatest Danger; because many of their People would soon
get drunk with the good Liquors found in my Ship.”

This generous Declaration was very acceptable to me, and I then
readily owned my former acquaintance with him. Then he turned to
Captain _Cocklyn_, and desired a Bowl of Punch might be made. Which
being done, the Captain desired Mr. _Griffin_ my Schoolfellow to show
me the way to the great Cabbin, and he followed himself.

There was not in the Cabbin either Chair, or any thing else to sit
upon; for they always kept a clear Ship ready for an Engagement: So a
Carpet was spread on the Deck, upon which we sat down cross-legg’d.
Captain _Cocklyn_ drank my Health, desiring, “I would not be cast
down at my Misfortune, for one of the Boat’s Crew who had taken us
had told him, My Ship’s Company in general spoke well of me; and they
had Goods enough left in the Ships they had taken to make a Man of
me.” Then he drank several other Healths, amongst which was that of
the _Pretender_, by the name of King _James the Third_, and thereby I
found they were doubly on the side of the Gallows, both as Traitors
and Pirates.

It being by this time Midnight, my Schoolfellow desired the Captain,
“To have a Hammock hung up for me to sleep in;” for it seems every
one lay rough, as they called it, that is, on the Deck; the Captain
himself not being allowed a Bed. This being granted, and soon after
done, I took leave of the Captain, and got into the Hammock, tho’
I could not sleep in my melancholy Circumstances. Moreover, the
execrable Oaths and Blasphemies I heard among the Ship’s Company,
shock’d me to such a degree, that in Hell it self I thought there
could not be worse; for tho’ many Seafaring Men are given to swearing
and taking God’s Name in vain, yet I could not have imagined, human
Nature could ever so far degenerate, as to talk in the manner those
abandoned Wretches did.

After I was got into the Hammock, Mr. _Griffin_, according to his
Promise, walked by me, with his broad Sword in his Hand, to protect
me from Insults. Some time after, it being about two a clock in
the morning, the Pirate _Boatswain_ (that attempted to kill me when
taken) came on board very drunk, and being told I was in a Hammock,
he came with his Cutlace near me. My generous Schoolfellow asked him
what he wanted? he answered, “To slice my Liver, for I was a vile
Dog, for ordering my People to fire on their Boat; neither would I
deliver my Watch when the _Quarter-master_ first demanded it.” Upon
hearing that, I told Mr. _Griffin_, “The last was false, for I had
immediately sent it by a Messenger, who only asked, what a clock
it was? supposing the Quarter-master expected it.” Then _Griffin_
bid the Boatswain keep his Distance, or else he would cleave his
head asunder with his Broad Sword. Nevertheless, that bloody-minded
Villain came on to kill me; but Mr. _Griffin_ struck at him with his
Sword, from which he had a narrow Escape, and then ran away: So I
lay unmolested till day light. By that time the Fumes of the Liquor
being gone off by Sleep amongst most of the Pirates, Mr. _Griffin_
complained to the Quarter-master and Company, of the cruel Intention
of the Boatswain towards me; representing, “They ought to observe
strictly that Maxim established amongst them, not to permit any ill
usage to their Prisoners after Quarter given.” At the hearing of
this, many of them voted for his being whipp’d, tho’ he was a great
Favourite of several others. But tho’ I wish’d him hang’d in my Mind
yet I thought it prudent to plead for him; saying, “I believed it
was his being in Liquor that was the cause of his using me in that
manner.” So he received a general Order, not to give me the least
Offence afterwards: Yet did that vile Wretch attempt once more to
kill me, as shall be related in its due place.

I come now to relate, How Mr. _Simon Jones_, my first Mate, and
ten of my Men entred with the Pirates. The Morning after we were
taken, he came to me, and said, “His Circumstances were bad at home:
Moreover, he had a Wife whom he could not love; and for these
Reasons he had entred with the Pirates, and signed their Articles.”
I was greatly surprized at this Declaration, and told him, “I was
very sorry to hear it, for I believ’d he would repent when too late;
and as he had taken this Resolution rashly, without communicating it
to me, all I could say now would be to no Purpose; neither would it
be proper for me, for the future, to have any Discourse with him in
private.” I saw this poor Man afterwards despised by his Brethren in
Iniquity; and have since been informed, he died a few Months after
they left the River _Sieraleon_. However, I must do him the Justice
to own, He never shewed any Disrespect to me; and the ten People he
persuaded to enter with him, remained very civil to me, and of their
own accord, always manned the side for me, whenever I went on board
the Ship they belonged to.

Several of these unhappy People soon after repented, and desired me
to intercede for them, that they might be cleared again; for they
durst not themselves mention it to the Quarter-master, it being death
by their Articles: But it was too nice a matter for me to deal in;
and therefore I refused them.

Some days after this, one of these poor Men, whose name was _Thomas
Wilder_, discovered things to me, of which I only had a suspicion
before. After cursing Mr. _Jones_ for persuading him to enter with
the Pirates, he said to me, “That several times in the Night-watch,
before we came to _Sieraleon_, he had heard him say, _That he hoped
we should meet with Pirates when we came to that River_; which he
then thought to be spoken only in jest; but now he found it too
true.” As I seemed not to believe this, he called another of our
People, who confirmed what he had told me. “Then I asked them the
Reason why the Chest of Arms was put out of the place where it
usually stood in the Steerage; and where it was hid at the time we
were taken?” They answered, “I might remember, that the Morning we
made Land, I ordered the Steerage to be clean’d; to do which all the
Chests there were carried between Decks; and after the Steerage was
clean’d, all the Chests were brought back again in their places,
except the Chest of Arms, which was left behind by the Mate’s Order:
That when I called to the People in the Steerage to fire on the
Pirate-boat, supposing Mr. _Jones_ had delivered them Arms according
to my Order, many of the Men would have broken the Chest open, but he
prevented them, by declaring, _This was an opportunity he had wished
for; and that if they fired a Musquet, they would be all cut to
pieces_.” And they further assured me, that to induce them to enter
with the Pirates, he had declared to them, _That I had promised him
to enter my self_. Putting all this together with what several of
the Pirates told me afterwards, namely, _That he had been the chief
occasion of their keeping my Ship_, it was a wonder that I escaped so
well, having such a base Wretch for my principal Officer.

But to resume the thread of my Story. As soon as the Fumes of the
Liquor were gone out of the Pirates Heads, they all went on board the
Prize, as they called my Ship, about eight a clock in the morning,
it being the second day of _April_. Mr. _Jones_, who had been my
first Mate, went with them; and he having confirmed them in their
intention of keeping the Ship for their own use, all hands went to
work to clear the Ship, by throwing over board Bales of Woollen
Goods; Cases of _India_ Goods; with many other things of great Value:
So that before night they had destroyed between three and four
thousand Pounds worth of the Cargoe. For they had little regard to
these things, Money and Necessaries being what they chiefly wanted.
The sight of this much grieved me, but I was obliged in prudence
to be silent. For my Schoolfellow told me, I was still under the
displeasure of many of them, on account of my ordering my People to
fire on their Boat when they took me.

There were then residing at _Sieraleon_, several _Englishmen_ who
traded on their own accounts; And among the rest, one Captain _Henry
Glynn_, who was since Governor for the Royal _African Company_ at
_Gambia_, and died there. This Gentleman was an honest generous
Person, and of so much Integrity, that tho’ he had suffered by the
Pirates when they first landed, yet he would never accept of any
Goods from them, which they had often press’d him to receive for his
own use. This Conduct, with an engaging deportment, so gained him
the Good-will of the Pirates, that they were ready to oblige him in
whatever he requested. Captain _Glynn_ and my self having formerly
been acquainted, as soon as he heard of my being taken, he engaged
Captain _Davis_ and _Le Boose_, the Commanders of the two other
Pirate Ships, who were then on Shore at his House, to come on board
with him to see me. I was very agreeably surprized with his coming
that Afternoon, and both the Pirate Captains that came with him
saluted me civilly. Captain _Davis_ told me, “He knew me,” tho’ I
never could recollect where I had seen him; and I found, he did not
care to tell, where he had seen me.

Soon after this, _Captain Cocklyn_ with his Quarter-master and
others, came from the Prize on board their old Ship, to compliment
Captain _Davis_ and the rest that came with him. After the
Compliments were over, Captain Davis generously said, “He was ashamed
to hear how I had been used by them. That they should remember,
their Reasons for going a pirating were to revenge themselves on
base Merchants, and cruel Commanders of Ships. That as for the Owner
of the Prize, he had not his Fellow in _London_ for Generosity and
Goodness to poor Sailors, as he had formerly heard from others,
and now from Captain _Glynn_: That as for my part, no one of my
People, even those that had entered with them, gave me the least ill
Character: But by their respect since shewn me, it was plain they
loved me. That he indeed had heard the occasion of my ill usage,
and of the ill-will some still bore me, was, because I had ordered
my People to defend the Ship: Which he blamed them exceedingly for;
saying, If he had had the good fortune to have taken me, and I had
defended my Ship against him, he should have doubly valued me for it:
That as he was not in Partnership with them, he would say no more at
present; but that he hoped they would now use me kindly, and give
me some Necessaries, with what remained undestroyed of my private
Adventure.” This was by no means relished by this pack of Miscreants;
for in their Hearts they hated Captain _Davis_, because he kept his
Ship’s Company in good order, tho’ they were almost double their
Number; and being a brave generous Man, they dreaded his Resentment.
However _Cocklyn_, and the chief of his People putting a good face on
the matter, invited him and Captain _Glynn_ on board the Prize; and
they two desiring I might accompany them, it was readily granted.

Soon after we were on board, we all went into the great Cabin, where
we found nothing but Destruction. Two _Scrutores_ I had there were
broke to Pieces, and all the fine Goods and Necessaries in them
were all gone. Moreover two large Chests that had Books in them
were empty; and I was afterwards informed, they had been all thrown
overboard; for one of the Pirates, upon opening them, swore, “There
was Jaw-work enough (as he called it) to serve a Nation, and proposed
they might be cast into the Sea; for he feared, there might be some
Books amongst them, that might breed Mischief enough; and prevent
some of their Comrades from going on in their Voyage to Hell, whither
they were all bound.” Upon which the Books were all flung out of the
Cabin-windows into the River.

After the Company were all sat down in the Cabin, they were treated
with all sorts of Liquors, and other things, that had once been
mine: By this means the chief Pirates being put into a good humour,
my Friend captain _Glynn_ took the opportunity of begging of the
Quarter-master several Necessaries for me: Which being readily
granted, they were tied up in Bundles, and Captain _Glynn_ designed
to take them on Shore with him to his House for me. But an unlucky
accident happened, which made me lose them all again.

For some of Captain _Davis_’s People coming on board at that time;
one of them, a pert young fellow of eighteen, broke a Chest open to
plunder it. The Quarter-master hearing of it, goes out of the Cabin,
and asks the reason of his so doing; the young Man replied, “As they
were all Pirates, he thought he did what was right.” On that the
Quarter-master strikes at him with his broad Sword, but the young
Man running away, escaped the Blow, and fled for protection into
the great Cabin to his Master Captain _Davis_. The Quarter-master
pursues him in a great Passion; and there not being room amongst
so many of us, to make a stroke at him, he made a thrust with his
Sword, and slit the Ball of one of the young Man’s Thumbs, and
slightly wounded at the same time Captain _Davis_ on the back of one
of his Hands. _Davis_ upon that was all on Fire, and vowed Revenge,
saying, “That tho’ his Man had offended, he ought to have been first
acquainted with it; for no other Person had a right to punish him
in his Presence;” and immediately goes on board his own Ship. Where
telling the Story to his Ship’s Company, they all resolved forthwith
to revenge this great injury done to one of their Comrades, and the
Indignity shown their Captain. Upon that they slip one of their
Cables, and begun to heave on the other, in order to come and board
_Cocklyn_’s Ship, and destroy such a set of vile Fellows, as they
called him and his Crew. When Captain _Davis_ went from the Prize,
_Cocklyn_ soon followed, and went on board his own Ship, to get
all things in a readiness to defend himself. Captain _Glynn_ and
my self only remained behind, and hoped quickly to have seen hot
work between them; but _Cocklyn_ having consulted his People, and
judging they should be no ways able to cope with Captain _Davis_,
hastily came on board the Prize again, and desired Captain _Glynn_
to go on board _Davis_ with him, in order to make up matters. My
Friend would have refused this unpleasant Office, if he durst; but
on his not readily complying, _Cocklyn_ grew enraged. I fearing the
consequences, persuaded, him to go: Which _Cocklyn_ was so well
pleased with, that he often spoke of it afterwards to my advantage.

By the time they came on board _Davis_, his Ship was just heaving up
their Anchor, and tho’ Captain _Glynn_ was a well-spoken ingenious
Man, he found it very difficult to compromise the Matter: Which at
last was done on these Terms; “That Captain _Davis_ and his Ship’s
Company, should have their share of Liquors and Necessaries on board
the Prize; and, That the Quarter-master, who had wounded the young
Man belonging to _Davis_, should before all his Crew acknowledge his
fault, and ask Pardon for the same.”

Night now approaching, Captain _Glynn_ was obliged to go on Shore,
without calling upon me for the Things he had begged, intending to
come next day for them. Being thus left on board the Prize, with
only three or four of the Pirates, amongst whom the bloody-minded
Boatswain (formerly mentioned) was one; and there being no Boat along
the side at that time, I resolved to stay where I was all night, and
not hail their Pirate-Ship to send their Boat for me.

The Pirate-Carpenter was then lying on my Bed in the State-room; so
I sat some time by my self in the Cabin, having a Candle by me on a
Table. When he awoke, he civilly desired me to go and take some rest;
saying, “He feared I had not had any since I was taken.” I returned
him thanks, saying, “I would sit up till eight a clock:” Whereupon he
came and fat down by me on the Lockers, abaft in the Cabin.

The Boatswain came down soon after this, and being a little in
Liquor, began to abuse me. On that the Carpenter told him, “He was a
base Villain,” and turned him out of the Cabin. Soon after, a puff of
Wind coming in at one of the Cabin Windows, put our Candle out; and
the Carpenter and I rising up together, to blow the Candle in again,
(but not being able to do it) we accidentally shifted places in the
dark, he seating himself just over against the Cabin Door, where I
sat before: And having no Tinder-box, we were at a great loss how to
light the Candle again.

While we were considering how to do it, the Boatswain came into
the Steerage, and finding the Candle out, began to swear and rant,
saying, “I had put it out purposely, with design to go into the
Powder-room undiscovered, and blow the Ship up.” But the Carpenter
called to him, and told him, “It was done by accident, and that I
still sat by him on the Locker.” So he came to the Cabin Door, and by
the Star-light that came in at the Windows, perceived us sitting; but
could not distinguish our Faces. Thinking I sat still in the Place
where he had seen me before, he presented a Pistol, and drew the
Trigger, swearing, “At that instant, he would blow my Brains out.” By
good fortune the Pistol did not go off, but only flash’d in the Pan:
By the Light of which the Carpenter observing that he should have
been shot instead of me, it so provoked him, that he run in the dark
to the Boatswain; and having wrenched the Pistol out of his hand, he
beat him, with that and his Fist, to such a Degree, that he almost
killed him.

The noise that was made in this Fray being heard on board the
Pirate-ship that lay close to us, a Boat was sent from her; and they
being informed of the Truth of the matter, the Officer that was in
her, thought fit to carry away this wicked Villain, who had three
times attempted to murder me.

After this I slept soundly, having been much fatigued; but I was
awaked early in the Morning by a great number of Captain _Davis_’s
Crew, who came on board to take part of the Liquors and Necessaries,
according to Agreement. It was very surprizing to see the Actions
of these People. They and _Cocklyn_’s Crew (for _Le Boose_’s were
not yet admitted) made such Waste and Destruction, that I am sure a
numerous set of such Villains would in a short time, have ruined a
great City. They hoisted upon Deck a great many half Hogsheads of
_Claret_, and _French Brandy_; knock’d their Heads out, and dipp’d
Canns and Bowls into them to drink out of: And in their Wantonness
threw full Buckets of each sort upon one another. As soon as they
had emptied what was on the Deck, they hoisted up more: And in the
evening washed the Decks with what remained in the Casks. As to
bottled Liquor of many sorts, they made such havock of it, that in
a few days they had not one Bottle left: For they would not give
themselves the trouble of drawing the Cork out, but nick’d the
Bottles, as they called it, that is, struck their necks off with a
Cutlace; by which means one in three was generally broke: Neither was
there any Cask-liquor left in a short time, but a little _French_
Brandy.

As to Eatables, such as Cheese, Butter, Sugar, and many other things,
they were as soon gone. For the Pirates being all in a drunken Fit,
which held as long as the Liquor lasted, no care was taken by any one
to prevent this Destruction: Which they repented of when too late.

As for my things, which the Quarter-master had given me at Captain
_Glynn_’s Request, and which were accordingly bundled up; a company
of drunken Pirates coming into the Cabin, and stumbling over some
Goods that lay on the Floor, they took them, with three of my
Bundles, and threw them overboard; swearing, “They had like to have
broken their Necks by those things lying in their way.”

I had then but one Bundle left, in which was a black Suit of Cloaths,
and other things which this Gang had spared. They being gone out of
the Cabin, a Pirate, who was tolerably sober, came in soon after,
and seeing my Bundle, said, “He would see what was in it;” which in
prudence I did not oppose. He then took out my black Cloth Cloaths,
a good Hat and Wig, and some other Things. Whereupon I told him,
“Captain _Cocklyn_’s Quarter-master had given them to me; and I hoped
he would not deprive me of them; for they were of no service to him
in so hot a Country, but would be of great use to me, as I should
soon return to _England_.” I had hardly done speaking, when he lifted
up his broad Sword, and gave me a Blow on the Shoulder with the flat
side of it; whispering at the same time these Words in my Ear, “I
give you this Caution, never to dispute the Will of a Pirate: For,
supposing I had cleft your Scull asunder for your Impudence, what
would you have got by it but Destruction? Indeed you may flatter your
self, I should have been put to death for killing a Prisoner in cold
Blood; but assure your self my Friends would have brought me off on
such an Occasion.” I gave him thanks for his Admonition, and soon
after he put on the Clothes, which in less than half an hour after,
I saw him take off and throw overboard. For some of the Pirates
seeing him dress’d in that manner, had thrown several Buckets of
Claret upon him. This Person’s true name was _Francis Kennedy_. He
was afterwards hang’d at _Execution-Dock_, but he told me at the time
he put my Cloaths on, that his name was _Sun_; asking me, “If I did
not know his Father, who was then Commander of a Ship that used the
_Barbadoes_ Trade; and that if ever the old Dog fell in his way, he
would kill him.” To which I answered, “I knew no such Person.”

When night came on, I had nothing left of what had been bundled up,
but a Hat and Wig. I must own, that whenever they plundered me, no
Affront was offered to my Person; but several brought me Liquor, and
Slices of Ham broiled, a Biscuit being my Plate; saying, “They pitied
my Condition.” The Hat and Wig I had left, being hung on Pins in the
Cabin, a person half drunk came in about eight a clock at night, and
put them on; telling me, “He was a great Merchant on Shore, and that
his name was _Hogbin_:” But supposing him to be a Pirate, I said
little to him. By this time there was a great Quietness in the Ship,
most of the Pirates being dead drunk. After a little Conversation,
as Mr. _Hogbin_ was going out of the Cabin with my Hat and Wig on,
he met _Cocklyn_’s Quarter-master; who knowing him not to be one of
the Crew, asked him, “How he came by the things he had on?” To which
the Fellow not returning a direct answer, the Quarter-master beat him
very severely for taking things he had no Right to. Then coming to
me, he asked in a kind manner, “How I had fared in the hurly burly of
that Day?” When I told him, “I had lost all the Necessaries he had
given me the Day before,” he express’d much concern, and said, “He
would take care the next day to recover what he could for me.” But he
did not prove so good as his word.

The next day, which was the third since my being taken, _Le Boose_’s
Crew were permitted to come on board the Prize, Where they finished
what was left of Liquors and Necessaries; acting in the same
destructive manner as their vile Brethren in Iniquity had done before.

Being quite weary of such Company, and understanding, the three
Pirate Captains were on Shore at my Friend Captain _Glynn_’s House,
I asked leave of the Quarter-master to go to them; which he readily
granted. On this I got into a Cannoe, and as we rowed towards the
Shore, we had like to have been overset, through the drunkenness of
one of the Pirates that was with us. If Providence had not prevented
this Accident, we should undoubtedly have all been lost; for the Tide
ran very strong, and several voracious Sharks were then near us.

When I came to Captain _Glynn_’s, he and the Pirate Captains received
me in a very civil manner; and upon my telling them, “How I had lost
all my Necessaries that had been given me;” the Captains promised,
That the next day they would do what they could, to recover some
of them again for me. Then I begged a Shirt of my Friend Captain
_Glynn_; for I had been three days without shifting, which is very
uneasy in so hot a Country, where people sweat so much.

Being greatly refresh’d with that clean Shirt, and having stayed all
night with him, where I had more rest than I before had for a good
while; next day I went on board, in company with the Pirate-Captains.
Captain _Davis_ desired _Cocklyn_ to order all his People on the
Quarter-deck, and made a Speech to them in my behalf; which they
relishing better than that he had formerly made, It was resolved to
give me the Ship they designed to leave, in order to go into the
Prize, with the Remains of my Cargoe that was undestroyed. And there
being a large quantity of Goods likewise remaining in several Prizes,
they concluded to give me them also: Which, with my own, were worth
several thousand Pounds. One of the leading Pirates proposed to the
rest, “That they should take me along with them down the Coast of
_Guinea_; where I might exchange the Goods for Gold: And if in order
to make a quick Sale, I sold them at prime cost, I should get Money
enough by them: That, no doubt, as they went down the Coast, they
should take some _French_ and _Portuguese_ Vessels, and then they
might give me as many of their best Slaves, as would fill the Ship:
That then he would advise me to go for the Island of St. _Thomas_ in
the _West Indies_, a Free port belonging to the _Danes_, and sell
them there, with the Vessel: And after rewarding my People in a
handsom manner, I might return with a large sum of Money to _London_,
and bid the Merchants defiance.”

This proposal was unanimously approved of by them: But it struck me
with a sudden damp, apprehending it would be fatal to me. So I began
to insinuate, “It would not be proper for me to accept of such a
quantity of other Peoples Goods, as they had so generously voted for
me:” And going on to give my reasons, I was immediately interrupted
by several of the Pirates, who began to be very angry, that I
did not readily accept of what had been proposed, so much for my
advantage, as they thought; for many of them were so ignorant, as to
think their Gift would have been legal.

On this, Captain _Davis_ said, “I know this Man, and can easily guess
his thoughts concerning this matter; for he thinks, if he should
act in the manner you have proposed, he shall ever after lose his
Reputation. Now I am for allowing every body to go to the Devil in
their own way; so desire you will give him the remains of his own
Cargoe, with what is left of his private Adventure, and let him do
with it what he thinks fitting.”

This was readily granted, and they advised me to take _Le Boose_’s
Brigantine, which he had then just quitted, (having fitted one of the
Prizes for a Pirate-ship for him and his Crew) and carry her along
the side of my Ship, in order to save the Goods then left undestroyed
in her; allowing me some of my own People to do it. By this means we
saved a considerable part of the Cargoe, but of my private Adventure
not above thirty Pounds Sterling: for that chiefly consisting in
Necessaries and Liquors, with fine Goods, was soon destroyed by them:
One instance of which out of many I shall give. The Pirates took
several Pieces of fine _Holland_, and opening them, spread them on
the Deck; and being almost drunk, lay down on them: Then others came
and threw Buckets of Claret upon them, which rousing them up, and the
_Hollands_ being thereby stained, they flung the Pieces overboard.

Captain _Davis_ likewise further obtained for me, that I might lye
on board the _Two Friends_ Captain _Elliot_ of _Barbadoes_; whom
they had taken and forced to be their Store Ship; and that I might
go on Shore when I pleased, to my Friend Captain _Glynn_’s house, on
condition I should return whenever they sent for me.

And now, the Tide being turned, they were as kind to me, as they had
been at first severe. So we got the Brigantine along the side of the
Prize, and as Bale-goods and Cases came to hand, we got them into
her; only now and then we lost some, by the ill-nature of two or
three leading Pirates: For if we could not receive the Goods so fast
as they expected, with the few People I had of my own then with me,
they would let them drop overboard.

The same they did by a quantity of _Irish_ Beef, the first day after
I was taken; for they despised it, having found so much _English_, in
the several Prizes they had met with in the River. This sight moved
me to intreat Captain _Cocklyn_ to give me the _Irish_ Beef they were
going to throw overboard; for the use of my poor People that had not
entered with them. But I being then under the high Displeasure of
him and his Crew, he brutishly replied, “There is Horse-beans enough
in the Prize to serve you and your People six Months.” To which I
answered, “It was coarse diet.” But finding this put him into a
passion, I held my Tongue, and the Beef was all cast into the Sea.

In this place I think it proper to acquaint the Reader, What danger
all the Prisoners were in by a false Report brought on board the
Prize Ships that afternoon. For it was confidently averred by some
Negroes, “That one of their Crew was murdered, by two Captains, whose
names were _Bennet_ and _Thompson_, who had been obliged to fly into
the Woods from the rage of the Pirates.” And they added, “That these
two Gentlemen coming to the House of one Mr. _Jones_, (who lived
a great way up the River) to seek for Provisions, they there met
with the person whom they had killed.” Upon this report the Pirates
resolved to revenge themselves on us who were their prisoners: “Which
obliged me to argue with them, and observe how great a cruelty it
would be, to punish us who were wholly innocent, for the faults of
others.” Moreover I said, “The report might be false, it coming
from the Shore-Negroes; and I hoped at least they would defer their
resentment against us, till they had a more certain account of the
matter.” This calmed their Rage a little, when, to our great Joy,
the Person that was reported to be killed, came on board soon after;
and told his Comrades, that he had met with Captain _Bennet_ and
_Thompson_ at Mr. _Jones_’s House, who threatned him; from which
the report arose that they had killed him; but that they had not
otherwise misused him: So on this their Passion was entirely calmed.

As I have mentioned these two Captains, _Bennet_ and _Thompson_, I
shall give an account of their Misfortunes, which I had afterwards
from their own Mouths. Captain _John Bennet_, being bound from
_Antegoa_ to the Coast of _Guinea_, was taken at _Cape de Verd_
Islands by _Davis_. Who, after plundering him, restored him his Ship;
and he went into the River _Sieraleon_, where Captain _Thompson_
was arrived before him. Upon _Cocklyn_ the Pirate’s coming into
the River, they carried their Ships a good way up, to a place
called _Brent’s-Island_, being the Settlement of the _Royal African
Company_; where one Mr. _Plunket_ was Governour. Having got their
Ships very near the Shore, they made a Battery thereon, and having
landed Ammunition, resolved with their People to defend themselves
to the utmost: thinking at that time they would remain faithful. _Le
Boose_ being arrived in his Brigantine, and hearing that several
Ships were up the River, he resolved to have one of them for his use;
so he went up to attack them, and they bravely defended themselves
against him: But, soon after, _Cocklyn_ coming with his Ship to the
assistance of _Le Boose_, their People begun to faulter; and these
gallant Captains were, for saving their Lives, obliged, with Mr.
_Plunket_, and several of their Officers, to fly into the Woods:
Where, for many Weeks, they remained, having nothing to subsist on
but Rice, with now and then some Oysters, which they got by night
from the River side: neither durst they appear near the place where
the Pirates were (as long as they remained there) for they had vowed
to cut them to pieces, if ever they fell into their hands. Moreover,
their Ships were burnt; and _Le Boose_ took for his own use, one
Captain _Lamb_’s Ship, which at that time lay farther up the River. I
thought proper to relate this, in order to set the story in a better
light, tho’ it happened some Weeks before I was taken.

But now, to return to my Subject. I was relating, how we were
employed in saving what Goods we could. This took us up four days;
and I slept every night on board their _Tender_ commanded by Captain
_Elliot_, who was very kind to me, and had a great ascendant over
the leading Pirates: so that he had seldom the Company of the
common sort, having orders to drive them away, whenever they came
on board him. And I have often been amazed, to hear and see what
he has done to some of them when they were impudent; beating them,
and saying, “He was sure he should see them hang’d in due time at
_Execution-dock_.” However, by this means we were generally very
easy on board him, which was no little satisfaction to me in my
Circumstances.

About this time the Quarter-master who took me, fell sick of a Fever;
which, increasing, he sent to speak with me: And having desired
all present, except my self to withdraw, he told me, “That at the
time I was taken, he designed to have killed me, when he presented
the Pistol to my breast; begging I would forgive him for his cruel
Intention:” Which I readily doing, he further said, “That he had been
a most wicked Wretch, having been guilty of all manner of abominable
Crimes; and that now believing he should die, his Conscience sadly
tormented him, fearing he should be punished, as he deserved, in
Hell-fire, which so often in their vile discourse he had made light
of.” Upon hearing that, “I exhorted him to sincere Repentance;
telling him, the Christian Religion assured us of God’s Mercies, if
we are truly penitent; and I instanced the goodness of God to my
self, in that he was graciously pleased to preserve me, the night
I was taken, from being murdered by him and others; which great
Mercies I believed were shown me, because I put my Hope and Trust
in Almighty God; and exhorted him to do the same.” But he replied,
with a sad countenance. “O, Sir, my heart is hardened; however, I
will endeavour to follow your good counsel.” As he was going on,
expressing his sorrow for his former course of Life, some of the
Pirates broke in upon us, to ask him, “How he did?” So he called
his Boy, and, as a mark of his Good-will towards me, ordered him
to take the Key of his Chest, and let me take out what Necessaries
I would. Accordingly I took that opportunity of providing my self
with Shirts, Stockings, and several other things. As I was taking
them out, a Pirate coming from the Deck, and knowing nothing of
the Quarter-master’s order, called out aloud; “see how that Dog is
thieving there: He does it as cleverly as any Rogue of us all.” But
being told, “It was with the Quarter-master’s leave,” he came and
helped me to bundle the things up, and I sent them on board the
_Tender_. These were the first Necessaries which I could call my own,
since my Misfortune.

The Quarter-master that evening falling into a Delirium, died before
morning in terrible Agonies; cursing his Maker in so shocking a
manner, that it made a great Impression on several new entered Men:
and they afterwards came privately to me, begging, “that I would
advise them how to get off from so vile a Course of Life, which led
them into Destruction both of Body and Soul. Some of them proposed
to fly into the Woods, and remain there till their Ships were gone,
if I would promise to protect them afterwards; but this being too
nice a matter for me to meddle with at that Juncture, I declined it;
Exhorting them in general, Not to be guilty of Murder, or any other
Cruelty to those they should take. For if ever they should, by a
general consent, resolve to embrace the King’s Pardon, it would be
a great Advantage to them, to have the unfortunate People they had
taken give them a good Character in that respect.”

Having mentioned the King’s Pardon, I shall here relate what I
before omitted, with relation to his late Majesty’s Proclamation,
for a _Pardon to Pirates, that should surrender themselves at any
of the_ British Plantations, _by the first of_ July 1719. This
Proclamation I had on board, with a Declaration of War against
_Spain_. The Quarter-master finding them amongst my Papers, and not
being able to read, he brought them to me, the next day after I was
taken, and “bid me read them aloud to all then present;” which I
did: But there being Rewards offered in the Proclamation, to those
that should take or destroy Pirates; so much for a Captain; and in
proportion for the other Officers and common Pirates; this put them
into such a Rage, that I began to apprehend my self in some Danger.
But Captain _Cocklyn_ ordering silence to be made, bid me read the
other Paper, which was _The Declaration of War against_ Spain. When
I had read it, some of them said, “They wished they had known it
before they left the _West Indies_” From thence I took occasion to
observe to them, “That if they thought fit to embrace his Majesty’s
most gracious Pardon, there was not only time enough for them to
return to the _West Indies_, (there being still three Months to
come of the time limited in the Proclamation) but now that War was
declared against _Spain_, they would have an opportunity of inriching
themselves in a legal way, by going a privateering, which many of
them had privately done.” This seemed to be relished by many: but
several old _Buccaneers_, who had been guilty of Murder and other
barbarous Crimes, being no ways inclined to it, they used the King’s
Proclamation with great contempt, and tore it in pieces. I thought my
self well off, that no Resentment or ill-usage was shown me on this
occasion.

Amongst the several Pirates, that came to consult me, “How they
should get off,” There was one _Ambrose Curtis_, who was in a bad
state of Health, and generally walked the Deck in a Silk Night-gown.
This person finding me shy in answering his Questions, he told me,
“Tho’ I had forgot him, yet he had not me; for he was eleven years
ago at Sea with my Father, who had used him severely for being an
unlucky Boy: That I might remember, my Father died in _Virginia_, and
I commanded the Ship afterwards, and brought her home to _England_;
having been very kind to him, except in one thing, which was, That
he having confessed to me, he was a Servant, and run away from his
Master, I refused to pay him his Wages, till he brought a person
who gave me Security that I should not pay them twice; and then he
had his Wages to a farthing:” Adding, “he had told this to several
leading Pirates, who had persuaded him to revenge himself on me; but
as I had been kind to him, and in his Conscience he believed I was in
the right, to demand Security when I paid him his Wages, so he bore
no ill-will to me on that account; and when my necessaries came to
be sold at the Mast, he would buy some of them for me;” in which he
proved as good as his word.

But as to his Questions about getting off, I replied as I had done
to others; “Assuring him, if ever it came to be in my power to serve
him, I would not spare for Money nor Pains to do it:” But this poor
fellow died, before the Pirates left _Sieraleon_.

I hope the Reader will pardon me for mentioning several things,
which are not so coherent as I could wish; as also several little
Incidents. The reason why I mention them is, because I think they
display the true humours and ways of these Miscreants.

Amongst my Adventure of Goods, I had in a Box three second-hand
embroidered Coats. One day the three Pirate Captains, coming on board
the Prize together, enquired for them, saying, “They understood by my
Book such Clothes were in my Ship.” I told them, “They were in a Box
under the bed place in the State-room. So they ordered them to be
taken out, and immediately put them on.” But the longest Coat falling
to _Cocklyn_’s share, who was a very short Man, it almost reached as
low as his Ancles. This very much displeased him, and he would fain
have changed with _Le Boose_, or _Davis_: But they refused, telling
him, “As they were going on Shore amongst the _Negroe-Ladies_, who
did not know the white Mens fashions, it was no matter. Moreover, as
his Coat was Scarlet embroidered with Silver, they believed he would
have the preference of them, (whose Coats were not so showy) in the
opinion of their Mistresses.” This making him easy, they all went on
Shore together.

It is a Rule amongst the Pirates, not to allow Women to be on board
their Ships, when in the Harbour. And if they should take a Prize at
Sea, that has any Women on board, no one dares, on pain of death, to
force them against their Inclinations. This being a good political
Rule to prevent disturbances amongst them, it is strictly observed.
So now being in a Harbour, they went on Shore to the Negroe-women,
who were very fond of their Company, for the sake of the great
Presents they gave them. Nay, some white Men that lived there, did
not scruple to lend their black Wives to the Pirates, purely on
account of the great Rewards they gave.

The Pirate Captains having taken these Cloaths without leave from the
Quarter-master, it gave great Offence to all the Crew; who alledg’d,
“If they suffered such things, the Captains would for the future
assume a Power, to take whatever they liked for themselves.” So, upon
their returning on board next Morning, the Coats were taken from
them, and put into the common Chest, to be sold at the Mast. And it
having been reported, “That I had a hand in advising the Captains to
put on these Coats,” it gained me the ill-will in particular of one
_Williams_, who was Quarter-master of _Le Boose_’s Ship. He seeing
me in the _Tender_’s Boat, going on board a _French_ Ship lately
taken, where he then was, he swore, “That if I came there, he would
cut me to pieces, for the advice I had given the Captains.” But
Captain _Elliot_, who was then in the Boat, whispered me, saying,
“Don’t be afraid of him, for it is his usual way of talking. But be
sure call him Captain, as soon as you get on board.” It seems this
Villain had been Commander of a Pirate Sloop; who, with a Brigantine,
two years before, took Captain _Laurence Prince_ in the _Whidaw
Galley_ near _Jamaica_; and being now Quarter-master, which he did
not like, he loved to have the Title of Captain given him. So when
I came into the _French_ Ship, I adressed my self to him, saying,
“Captain _Williams_, pray hear me upon the Point you are so offended
at.” Upon that he gave me a slight Blow on the Shoulder, with the
flat of his Cutlace, swearing at the same time, “he had not the heart
to hurt me;” When I had told him how the affair had really happen’d,
which he had been so angry about, he gave me a Keg of Wine, and was
my Friend ever after.

The _French_ Ship just now mentioned, fell into their hands about a
fortnight after I was taken by them, in this manner. It was not bound
to _Sieraleon_, but having not had an Observation for several days,
because the Sun was near their _Zenith_, they made land unexpectedly;
and not knowing certainly whereabouts they were, but seeing several
Ships in the River at an Anchor, they came boldly towards them.

I was then on board Captain _Cocklyn_’s old Ship; for they had not
quite fitted mine for their use, not having at that time any Guns
mounted; so I saw the great fear and confusion that was amongst them.
My Mate, who had entered with them, said, “He believed, by the Ship’s
coming in so boldly, it was the _Launceston_ Man of War of forty
Guns, whom we had left in _Holland_. For he had heard me say, she was
to follow us to the Coast of _Guinea_.”

Happy would it have been for us and many more, if it had been so. For
had that, or even a smaller Ship of twenty Guns, with the King’s
Commission, come in at that time, or any other, whilst I was in their
hands, I am persuaded they would have easily destroyed them. For the
new-entered-men had little Courage; and the far greater part both of
old and new Pirates, were so much in drink, that there could have
been no Order or Conduct amongst them in an Engagement. So that it
would have been very easy to have subdued them, and prevented that
terrible Destruction, which happened to above one hundred Sail of
Ships, that fell afterwards into their Hands, in their going down the
Coast of _Guinea_: Together with those Damages that happened a good
while after in the _East Indies_, by some of this Gang; and the great
Ravage made by _Roberts_ (who rose out of _Davis_’s Ashes) the second
time, on the Coast of _Guinea_, till he was happily destroyed by
Sir _Chaloner Ogle_ in the _Swallow_ Man of War. But the reason why
no timely care was taken to prevent so great a Destruction, is not
proper for me to mention in this place.

As I had no business to be on board the Pirate Ship in time of
Action, I asked Captain _Cocklyn_’s leave to go on board their
_Tender_, which he readily granted. Just as I was going, several of
my People who had entered with him, said, “They would go along with
me, for they had never seen a Gun fired in anger.” _Cocklyn_ hearing
that, told them, “That now they should learn to smell Gunpowder,” and
caned them heartily.

So I went on board Captain _Elliot_, where I soon saw the _French_
Ship taken. For coming so unexpectedly into the Pirates hands, they
made no Resistance: And because the Captain did not strike on their
first firing, they put a Rope about his Neck, and hoisted him up
and down several times to the Main-yard-arm, till he was almost
dead. Captain _Le Boose_ coming at that instant, luckily saved his
Life: And highly resenting this their cruel usage to his Countryman,
he protested, “he would remain no longer in Partnership with such
barbarous Villains.” So, to pacify him, they left the _Frenchmen_
with the Ship in his care; and after the Cargoe was destroyed, they
cut the Ship’s Masts by the board, and run her on Shore, for she was
very old, and not fit for their purpose.

After the affair of the _French_ Ship was over, I was employed for
several days, in landing out of the Brigantine the Goods that had
been given me, out of my own Ship’s Cargoe, and carrying them to my
Friend Captain _Glynn_’s House; in which both he and I worked very
hard. For my own People that did not enter with the Pirates, were
mostly obliged to work on board the Prize, in fitting her for them;
and the Natives who served Captain _Glynn_ at his House, were grown
so insolent by the large quantity of Goods given them by the Pirates,
that they would do nothing but what they pleased. However, at last,
with much trouble we got them housed.

By this time, which was about the 20th of _April_, the Ship they had
taken from me was compleatly fitted, and the next day was appointed
to name her, to which Ceremony I was invited. When I came on board,
the Pirate Captains told me, “It was not out of Disrespect they
had sent for me, but to partake of the good Cheer provided on this
occasion:” So they desired I would be chearful, and go with them into
the great Cabin. When I came there, Bumpers of Punch were put into
our Hands, and on Captain _Cocklyn_’s saying aloud, _God bless the_
Windham Galley, we drank our Liquor, broke the Glasses, and the Guns
fired.

The Ship being Galley-built, with only two flush Decks, the Cover of
the Scuttle of the Powder-room was in the great Cabin, and happened
at that time to be open. One of the aftermost Guns blowing at the
Touch-hole, set fire to some Cartouch-boxes, that had Cartridges in
them for small Arms, the Shot and Fire of which flew about us, and
made a great smother. When it was over, Captain _Davis_ observed,
there had been great Danger to us from the Scuttle’s being open;
there being under, in a Room, above _twenty thousand_ weight of
Gunpowder. _Cocklyn_ replied, “He wished it had taken fire, for it
would have been a noble blast, to have gone to Hell with.”

Then all going upon Deck, three Prizes that remained undestroyed,
were ordered to be burned; upon hearing that, I privately represented
to Captain _Davis_, “How hard it would be upon us who were Prisoners,
to remain in that Country, without Necessaries, and without Food to
subsist on: Besides, there was no manner of Prospect of our getting
away quickly: That to the many Obligations I owed him, I hoped he
would add one more, and, by his Interest, at least save one of the
Vessels, for us to return to _England_ in: That as he had several
times hinted to me, how much he disliked that course of Life, hoping
he should have an opportunity of leaving it in a short time; so I
wished he would put it in my power, to report to his Advantage, the
good deed I then requested of him; for, in my Opinion, next to
Murder and Cruelty, too often practised by Pirates, nothing could
make them more odious to the World, than their destroying, out of
mere Wantonness, so many Ships and Cargoes, as had been done by
_Cocklyn_ and _Le Boose_’s Crews; in which I knew he had no hand: And
if he would be pleased to procure my entire Liberty, at the same time
that he pleaded for one of the Vessels for us, it would be a double
Obligation on me to Gratitude, in case it ever fell in my power to
serve him.”

This he readily promised, and by his Management the Ships were saved
from being burned, and they made a Bonfire only of the old _Rising
Sun_, being the Ship they had quitted for mine: And now obtaining,
through Captain _Davis_’s means, my intire Liberty, I went on Shore
to my friend Captain _Glynn_’s House again.

Two days after this Captain _Elliot_ sent his Boat for me, desiring
I would forthwith come on board his Ship, because he wanted very
much to speak with me. I had too many obligations to this Gentleman
to refuse going, (tho’ I had a sort of an aversion.) Upon coming
on board, he privately represented to me, “That I knew he had been
obliged against his will by the Pirates, to receive into his Ship a
great quantity of other People’s Goods; for which he might hereafter
be called to an account; therefore he desired I would give him a
Certificate, testifying the Truth of it.” Knowing this to be true,
I readily complied; for he was a very honest Man, as appeared soon
after. For the Pirates compelling him to go out of the River with
them, as their _Tender_, he took the first opportunity of getting
from them, which he did in a Tornado, or sudden Gust of Wind, that
arose in the Night; and having the good fortune to succeed in his
attempt, he made a good Voyage for his Owners, with Slaves to
_Barbadoes_; where he fell sick and died.

While I was in his Ship, the three Pirate Captains called along the
side. Not expecting to see me there, they seemed very glad of it, and
invited me to go and sup with them on board Captain _Davis_. This I
declined, being desirous of going on Shore to Captain _Glynn_’s. But
Captain _Davis_ insisting on it, I thought it prudent to comply; that
I might not lose that Gentleman’s Good-will, who had been so kind to
me.

After we had been some time on board his Ship, Supper was brought up
about eight a clock in the Evening; and the Musick was ordered to
play, amongst which was a Trumpeter, that had been forced to enter
out of one of the Prizes. About the middle of Supper, we heard upon
Deck an outcry of Fire, and instantly a Person came to us, and said,
“The Main-hatch-way was all in a Flame;” so we all went upon Deck.

At that time, besides the Pirates Ship’s Crew, who were mostly drunk,
there was on board at least fifty Prisoners; and several Boats along
the side, into which many People jumped, and put off. I being then
on the Quarter-deck, with the Captains, observed this to them; but
they all in confusion said, “We know not what to do in the matter:”
Upon that I told them, “If the sober People were allowed to go away
with the Boats, no one would endeavour to save the Ship; and we that
were left should be lost, (for the other Ships were above a Mile from
us, and the Tide of Flood then run so strong, that their Boats could
not row against it to save us:)” So I proposed to them, “to fire the
Quarter-deck Guns at the Boats that had just put off, to oblige them
to come on board again;” which being instantly done, it so frightned
the People in them, that they forthwith came back; and all that were
able, and not drunk, lent their helping hand to put out the Fire;
which by this time was come to a great head in the Ship’s hold.

After this I went down into the Steerage, where I saw one _Goulding_,
who was Gunner’s Mate, and a brisk active Fellow, put his head up
the After-hatchway, calling for Blankets and Water; “which if not
brought immediately, (he said) the Bulk-head of the Powder-room
would be fired, and the Ship soon blown up.” Observing the Stupidity
of the People about me, who stood looking on one another, I caught
up several Blankets and Rugs which lay scattered about, and flung
them to him, and so did others by my example. Then I run out of the
Steerage upon Deck, where meeting with some People that were sober,
I got them to go over the side, and draw up Buckets of Water; And
others handing them to _Goulding_, who had by this time placed the
Blankets and Rugs against the Bulk-head of the Powder-Room, he flung
this Water on them, and thereby prevented the Flames from catching
the Powder, and consequently from blowing up the Ship, which must
otherwise have happened: For there was then on board at least _thirty
thousand_ pounds of Gunpowder, which had been taken out of several
Prizes, it being a Commodity much in request amongst the _Negroes_.

There was still great Confusion amongst us, occasioned by the
darkness of the Night, and the many drunken People, who were not
sensible of the great Danger we were in: Moreover, the People in
the Hold gave us as yet no Hopes of their getting the Mastery of
the Fire. So I went again on the Quarter-deck, and considered with
my self, if the fire could not be conquered, as I could not swim,
I should have no chance of being saved: and even those that could,
would, I knew, be exposed to be torn to pieces by voracious Sharks,
which abound in that River: So I took one of the Quarter-deck
Gratings, and lowered it by a Rope over the Ship’s-side, designing
to get on that, if I should be forced to quit the Ship. For tho’ the
Boats had been once obliged to come back, yet it being a dark Night,
some People, unperceived, had slipped again away with them, and were
quite gone away.

Whilst I stood musing with my self on the Quarter-deck, I heard a
loud shout upon the Main-deck, with a Huzza, “_For a brave blast to
go to Hell with_,” which was repeated several times. This not only
much surprized me, but also many of the new entered Pirates; who were
struck with a Pannick Fright, believing the Ship was just blowing
up; so that several of them came running on the Quarter-deck, and
accidentally threw me down, it being very dark. As soon as I got
upon my Legs again, I heard these poor wretches say, in a lamentable
Voice, one to another; “Oh! that we could be so foolish as to enter
into this vile course of Life! The Ship will be immediately blown up,
and we shall suffer for our Villanies in Hell Fire.” So that when the
old hardened Rogues on the Main-deck, wish’d for a blast to go to
Hell with, the other poor wretches were at the same time under the
greatest Consternation at the thoughts of it.

The Apprehension of the Ship’s being just ready to blow up, was
so universal, that above fifty People got on the Bolt-sprit, and
Sprit-sail-yard, thinking they should have there a better chance for
their Lives: But they much deceived themselves, for had so great a
quantity of Powder as was at that time on board, been fired, it
would have blown them up to Atoms.

There was one _Taylor_, Master of this Pirate Ship, as brisk and
couragious a Man as ever I saw; (who afterwards commanded the
_Cassandra_, an _English East India_ Ship, and carried her to _New
Spain_, where he and his Crew separated.) This Person, with fifteen
more, spared no pains to extinguish the Fire in the Hold; and tho’
they were scalded in a sad manner by the Flames, yet they never
shrunk till it was conquered; which was not till near ten a clock at
night, when they came upon Deck, declaring the Danger was over: So
the Surgeons were called to dress their burns. This was joyful News
to us all on Deck, for we little expected to escape.

I shall now relate how this Fire happened, from which our Deliverance
was almost miraculous. About half an hour after eight a clock in the
evening, a Negroe Man went into the Hold, to pump some Rum out of a
Cask; and imprudently holding his Candle too near the Bung-hole,
a Spark fell into the Hogs-head, and set the Rum on fire. This
immediately fired another Cask of the same Liquor, whose Bung had
been, through carelessness, left open: And both the Heads of the
Hogsheads immediately flying out, with a report equal to that of a
small Cannon, the fire run about the Hold. There were twenty Casks of
Rum, with as many Barrels of Pitch and Tar, very near the place where
the Rum lay that was fired; yet it pleased God none of these took
fire, otherwise it would have been impossible for us to escape.

After this was over, I was obliged to stay on board till Morning, all
the Boats being run away with. In that time _Golding_, the Gunner’s
Mate, told the Pirate’s Crew several things to my Advantage: “How I
had handed the Blankets to him, and ordered Water to be thrown on
them; which saved the Bulk-head, where the Powder lay, from being
fired, and consequently the Ship from being blown up.” So now I was
more than ever in their favour: For several of them desired me to
come on board the _Windham_ Galley, the day Things were sold there at
the Mart, and then they would be kind to me. Likewise Captain _Davis_
press’d me to come, asking me, “Whether the Gold Watch that was taken
from me was a good one?” To which I answering, “It was very good, at
that time.” He then said, “He would buy it for his own use at any
rate.”

While he and I were talking thus, one of the Mates came half drunk,
on the Quarter-deck, saying to him; “I propose in behalf of the
Ship’s Company, that this Man shall be obliged to go down the Coast
of _Guinea_ with us; for I am told we cannot have a better Pilot.”
This was a great surprize to me; but my generous Friend _Davis_ soon
put me out of pain. For he told him, “They wanted no Pilot:” and the
fellow still insisting on my going, Captain _Davis_ caned him off the
Quarter-deck, and I heard no more of it: For soon after I went on
Shore to my Friend Captain _Glynn_’s House.

Two days after this, a small Vessel came into the River, and was
taken by them: It was called the _Dispatch_ Captain _Wilson_,
belonging to the Royal _African Company_. Mr. _Simon Jones_, formerly
my first Mate, who had entered with the Pirates, (as I have before
related) told them, on this occasion, “That he had once commanded
a Ship, which was hired and freighted by the _African_ Company;
and that he had been very unjustly used by them; so he desired the
_Dispatch_ might be burned, that he might be revenged of them.” This
being immediately consented to, and forthwith ordered to be executed,
one _John Stubbs_, a witty brisk fellow, stood up, and desired to
be heard first; saying, “Pray, Gentlemen, hold a little, and I will
prove to you, if this Ship is burnt, you will thereby greatly serve
the _Company_’s Interest.” This drawing every one’s attention, they
bid him go on: Then he said, “The Vessel has been out these two years
on her Voyage, being old and crazy, and almost eaten to pieces
by the Worms; besides, her Stores are worth little, and as to her
Cargoe, it consists only of a little Redwood and _Melegette-pepper_;
so if she should be burned, the Company will lose little; but the
poor People that now belong to her, and have been so long a Voyage,
will lose all their Wages, which, I am sure, is three times the
Value of the Vessel, and of her trifling Cargoe; so that the Company
will be highly obliged to you for destroying her.” The rest of the
Crew being convinced by these Reasons, the Vessel was spared, and
delivered again to Captain _Wilson_ and his People, who afterwards
came safe to _England_ in it.

The 29th of _April_, such of the Pirates as were my Friends, sent me
word on Shore, “That the Sale of Necessaries was to begin that day in
the afternoon, in the _Windham-Galley_, Captain _Cocklyn_.” So I went
on board in a large _Cannoe_, belonging to two Men that lived ashore,
who went at the same time with me. At the Sale, several of the
Pirates bought many Necessaries that had been mine, and gave them to
me. Likewise, Mr. _James Griffin_, my Schoolfellow, was so civil as
to beg from those that were not so kind to me, as he hoped they would
have been. The two white Men that went with me in the Cannoe, minded
their own business so well, that they got several great Bundles of
Clothes and Goods, which they put into the Cannoe with mine.

By this time several Pirates being half drunk with Brandy, looked
over the side, and seeing so many Bundles in the Cannoe, which they
supposed to be all mine, they swore, “I was insatiable, and that
it would be a good deed to throw them overboard.” This my kind
Schoolfellow hearing, he came and told me of it; advising me, to go
immediately on Shore; which I accordingly did; and it proved very
happy for me. For soon after my Watch was put up to sale, and many
bidding for it, some of them out of Spite to Captain _Davis_, it was
run up to one hundred Pounds, which he paid down. One of the Pirates
being greatly vexed at it, said, “He believed the Cases of the Watch
were not good Gold;” and calling for a Touch-stone, he tried them
on it. The Touch looking of a _copperish_ Colour, (as indeed all
Gold-cases of Watches do on the touch, by reason of the quantity of
Alloy put in to harden them) this pretence served the turn of this
Villain; who thereupon exclaimed against me, saying, “I was a greater
Rogue than any of them, who openly professed Piracy; since I was so
sly, as to bring a base Metal Watch, and endeavour to put it off for
a gold one.”

This Speech procured me the Anger of many, who knew no better; they
believing every word of what he said to be true. And tho’ Captain
_Davis_ laugh’d at it, yet several swore, “If I had not been gone
on Shore, they would have whipped me:” And as their Drunkenness
increased, they talked of sending for me to be punished for so great
a Villany, as they called it. But my Schoolfellow, apprehending they
would really offer me some Violence, was so kind as to send me word
of what had pass’d, by a white Man living on Shore, who was then on
board; advising me to go into the Woods, for they should sail quickly
out of the River.

The next morning early, which was the last day of _April_, as I was
just going to follow his advice, I was agreeably surprized with the
arrival of one Mr. _James Bleau_, my Surgeon, whom they designed to
take by force with them. This honest Man had been very much cast
down at it, and had often desired me to intercede for his liberty.
Accordingly I had done it, representing, “That he grieved himself so
much, that if he did not die quickly, yet he would be of no use to
them:” But this had no effect. However, at last, a fortunate accident
cleared him, when he least expected it; for that very evening, after
I was come on Shore, the Surgeon of the _French_ Ship entered with
them; whereupon they gave Mr. _Bleau_ his Liberty the next morning.

Mr. _Bleau_ brought us the agreeable News, that the three Pirate
Ships, with their _Tender_, were under sail, going out of the
River. This gave us all on Shore the highest Satisfaction; for I had
been then in their hands a Month, and many others much longer. Mr.
_Bleau_, whom I have here mentioned, lives now at _Woodford-Row_ on
_Epping-Forest_, where he follows his Business.

I shall now inform the Reader, what became of my kind Schoolfellow
_Griffin_, and my generous Friend _Davis_. The first took an
opportunity of getting out of the hands of the Pirates, by taking
away a Boat from the Stern of the Ship he was in, when off the Road
of _Annamaboe_, on the Coast of _Guinea_. He was driven on Shore
there, unperceived in the night time; and from thence went to _Cape
Coast Castle_, belonging to the Royal _African Company_; from which
place he went Passenger to _Barbadoes_, in an _English_ Ship, where
he was taken with a violent Fever and died.

As to _Davis_, having discovered, a few days after they left the
River _Sierraleon_, a Conspiracy, to deprive him of his Command,
which was carried on by one _Taylor_, that was Master of the Ship
under him, he timely prevented it: But he and some others left their
Ship, and went on board the _Windam_ Galley, Captain _Cocklyn_, by
whom he found _Taylor_ had been set on to displace him. This causing
him to leave their Partnership, he took a few days after one Captain
_Plumb_ in the _Princess_ of _London_, whose second Mate _Roberts_,
so famous afterwards for his Villanies, entered with him; and
_Davis_’s Crew, after plundering the Ship, restored her to Captain
_Plumb_ again. After this, Captain _Davis_ went for the Island
_Princess_, belonging to the _Portuguese_, which lies in the Bay of
_Guinea_. Here the Pirates gave out, “They were a King’s Ship;” but
the People soon discovered what they were by their lavishness, in
purchasing fresh Provisions with Goods; but the Governour winked at
it, on account of the great Gains he, and others of the chief of his
People made by them. But at last some putting him in mind, “That if
this Affair should come to the King of _Portugal_’s ear, it might
prove his ruin;” he plotted how to destroy _Davis_ and his Crew, in
order to colour over what he had so basely permitted, in allowing
them a free trade, after discovering they were Pirates.

Captain _Davis_ being one day on Shore with the Governor, he told
him, “They designed to sail from the Island in three days, and that
he would come, and take his leave of him the day before.” Accordingly
he went on a Sunday morning, taking with him his first Surgeon, the
Trumpeter, and some others, besides the Boat’s Crew. At their coming
into the Governor’s House, they saw no body to receive them; so they
went on, till they came into a long Gallery fronting the Street. Here
the Governor’s _Major Domo_ presently came to them, saying, “His
Master was at his Country-House, but he had sent a Messenger to him,
when they saw Captain _Davis_ coming on Shore; and no doubt he would
soon be in Town.” But the Surgeon observing, that many People had got
together in the Street, with Arms in their hands, he said to his
Captain, “I am sure we shall see no Governor to day,” and advised him
immediately to go away. So _Davis_ and the Surgeon went out of the
House; whereupon the _Major-Domo_ called to the People in the Street,
to fire at them. The Surgeon and two more were kill’d on the Spot,
and the Trumpeter was wounded in the Arm, who seeing two _Capuchin_
Friers (from whom I had this Account at the Island _Princess_)
fled to them. One of them took him in his Arms to save him, but
a _Portuguese_ came, and shot him dead without any regard to the
Frier’s Protection. Captain _Davis_, tho’ he had four Shots in divers
parts of his Body, yet continued running towards the Boat: But being
closely pursued, a fifth Shot made him fall, and the _Portuguese_
being amazed at his great Strength and Courage, cut his Throat, that
they might be sure of him.

The Boat’s Crew hearing the firing, put off in good time at some
distance from the Shore; and seeing the _Portuguese_ advancing to
fire at them, they rowed on board their Ship; where relating what
had happened, as they supposed, to their Captain, and to the rest
left on Shore, it set the Pirates all in a flame; and they directly
chose _Roberts_ for their Commander, vowing a severe revenge on the
_Portuguese_.

The Water was so shallow, that they could not get their Ship near the
Town; so they prepared a Raft, on which they mounted several pieces
of Cannon, with which they fired at the place: But the Inhabitants
having quitted it, and all the Houses being of Timber, they did
little damage to the Town. Neither durst they land to burn the Place,
for fear of the great Number of People, whom they perceived in the
Bushes with small Arms: So, they returned to their Ship, and the next
day sailed out of the Harbour.

Thus fell Captain _Davis_, who (allowing for the Course of Life he
had been unhappily engaged in) was a most generous humane Person.
And thus _Roberts_ arose, who proved the reverse of him, and did
afterwards a great deal of mischief in the _West Indies_, and on
the Coast of _Guinea_; till he and his Crew were happily suppress’d
by Sir _Chaloner Ogle_, in the _Swallow_ Man of War, and in the
Engagement, _Roberts_, and several of his People were killed. But
as there is _An Account of the Pirates_ published, in which the
principal Actions of _Roberts_ are related, I shall say nothing
more of him here; but go on to relate what is not mentioned in the
aforesaid Book.

As soon as it was commonly known, that the Pirates were sailed from
_Sierraleon_, Captain _Bennet_ and _Thompson_, with several others
that had been obliged to keep in the Woods, as I have formerly
related, came to Captain _Glynn_’s House. There we all consulted
about preparing the _Bristol Snow_, which the Pirates had spared at
my Intreaty, so as to make it fit for us to return to _England_ in.
There was with us one Captain _David Creichton_, in the _Elizabeth_
of _London_, laden with dying Wood; whom the Pirates had taken not
long before me. Him they plundered, and would have destroyed, but by
the Interest of Mr. _James Griffin_, who had been chief Mate with
the Captain’s Brother, the Ship was spared. In this Ship Captain
_Creichton_ took as many People as he possibly could, in order to
spare our Provisions, and sailed a few days after the Pirates left
the River _Sierraleon_, for _London_: We that were left behind,
sent notice by him to our Owners of the great Misfortunes that had
befallen us.

Then applying our selves to fit the _Bristol-Snow_, whom a worthy
Person, one Captain _John Morris_, commanded, we found we should
be in very great want of Provisions, considering how many poor
People desired to go home with us. Upon that Captain _Glynn_ sent
a small Sloop belonging to him, to fetch Provisions from the River
_Sherberow_, where the destroying Pirates had not been. From thence
she returned in a few days, with a good quantity; and one Captain
_Nisbet_ having found under his Ship’s Ballast in the Hold, several
Casks of Beef; which had not come to the knowledge of the Pirates
(otherwise it would no doubt have been destroyed, as most part of his
Cargoe was) he was so kind as to spare me as much of this Beef as he
possibly could; and I drew a Bill on my Owner for the value of it.

Moreover, we found in the _French_ Ship that had been taken, and
afterwards run on Shore by the Pirates, a large quantity of good
Biscuit, so that now we were sufficiently provided in all respects.

Lastly, knowing that large quantities of Goods had been given by
the Pirates, to all the white Men residing on Shore upon their own
accounts, we all went in a Body to demand them. Messieurs _Mead_
and _Pearce_, who were in Partnership, very readily and honourably
delivered up all they were possessed of: But others did not follow
their Example; for they only shewed us what Goods they thought
proper, of which I allowed them one third part for salvage.

So I shipp’d what I had recovered from them, with the other Goods the
Pirates had given me formerly out of Captain _Morris_’s Vessel; and
then we embarked in her, being above sixty Passengers, besides six
Masters of Ships, whose Vessels had been destroyed, or fitted for
the use of the Pirates. We left the River _Sierraleon_ the 10th day
of _May_, and, after a tedious Passage, occasioned by the Ship’s bad
sailing, we came safe to _Bristol_, the first of _August_ 1719.

On my landing at the Key, Mr. _Casamajor_, Merchant of that
City, came to me, and delivered me a Letter from my Owner, the
late _Humphrey Morrice_ Esq; who had received mine by Captain
_Creichton_, with the account of my Misfortune, a few days before
we arrived at _Bristol_. Mr. _Morrice_, in his Letter, was pleased
to comfort me under so severe a Trial, as I had undergone, assuring
me, “He would immediately give me the Command of another Ship;
(which accordingly he most generously did soon after) and that he
had ordered Mr. _Casamajor_, his Correspondent, to supply me with
Money, to distribute amongst my poor Sailors, who had returned with
me to _Bristol_; in order to enable them to go to their several
Habitations,” which was in several Parts of _England_.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the

of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
