INTRODUCTION.


[Transcriber’s Note: This e-book is Number 4 of Volume X of a series,
which had a single page numbering system throughout the Volume. Thus,
although this e-book is pages 233 through 351, it contains references to
pages outside of this range in the same Volume.]

With the publication of the texts included in this the last part of volume
X, _Sumerian Liturgical and Epical Texts_, the writer arrives at a
definite stage in the interpretation of the religious material in the
Nippur collection. Having been privileged to examine the collection in
Philadelphia as well as that in Constantinople, I write with a sense of
responsibility in giving to the public a brief statement concerning what
the temple library of ancient Nippur really contained. Omitting the
branches pertaining to history, law, grammar and mathematics, the
following _résumé_ is limited to those tablets which, because of their
bearing upon the history of religion, especially upon the origins of
Hebrew religion, have attracted the attention of the public on two
continents to the collections of the University Museum.

Undoubtedly the group of texts which have the most human interest and
greatest literary value is the epical group, designated in Sumerian by the
rubric _zag-sal_.(1) This literary term was employed by the Sumerian
scribes to designate a composition as didactic and theological. Religious
texts of such kind are generally composed in an easy and graceful style
and, although somewhat influenced by liturgical mannerisms, may be readily
distinguished from the hymns and psalms sung in the temples to musical
accompaniment. The _zagsal_ compositions(2) are mythological and
theological treatises concerning the deeds and characters of the great
gods. The most important didactic hymns of the Nippur collection and in
fact the most important religious texts in early Sumerian literature are
two six column tablets, one (very incomplete) on the Creation and the
Flood published by DR. POEBEL, and one (all but complete) on Paradise and
the Fall of Man. Next in importance is a large six column tablet
containing a mythological and didactic hymn on the characteristics of the
virgin mother goddess.(3) A long mythological hymn in four columns(4) on
the cohabitation of the earth god Enlil and the mother goddess Ninlil and
an equally long but more literary hymn to the virgin goddess Innini(5) are
good examples of this group of tablets in the Nippur collection.(6) One of
the most interesting examples of didactic composition is a hymn to the
deified king Dungi of Ur. By accident both the Philadelphia and the
Constantinople collections possess copies of this remarkable poem and the
entire text has been reconstructed by the writer in a previous
publication.(7) 1 have already signaled the unique importance of this
extraordinary hymn to the god-man Dungi in which he is described as the
divinely born king who was sent by the gods to restore the lost
paradise.(8) The poem mentions the flood which, according to the Epic of
Paradise, terminated by divine punishment the Utopian age. The same
mythological belief underlies the hymn to Dungi. Paradise had been lost
and this god-man was sent to restore the golden age. There is a direct
connection between this messianic hymn to Dungi and the remarkable Epic of
Paradise. All other known hymns to deified kings are liturgical
compositions and have the rubrics which characterize them as songs sung in
public services. But the didactic hymn to Dungi has the rubric
[_d__Dungi_] _zag-sal_, “O praise Dungi.” It would be difficult to claim
more conclusive evidence than this for the correctness of our
interpretation of the group of _zagsal_ literature and of the entire
mythological and theological exegesis propounded in the edition of the
Epic of Paradise, edited in part one of this volume.(9)

When our studies shall have reached the stage which renders appropriate
the collection of these texts into a special corpus they will receive
their due valuation in the history of religion. That they are of prime
importance is universally accepted.

From the point of view of the history of religion I would assign the
liturgical texts to the second group in order of importance. Surprisingly
few fragments from the long canonical daily prayer services have been
found. In fact, about all of the perfected liturgies such as we know the
Sumerian temples to have possessed belong to the cults of deified kings.
In the entire religious literature of Nippur, not one approximately
complete canonical prayer service has survived. Only fragments bear
witness to their existence in the public song services of the great
temples in Nippur. A small tablet(10) published in part two of this volume
carries a few lines of the titular or theological litany of a canonical or
musically completed prayer book as they finally emerged from the
liturgical schools throughout Sumer. Long liturgical services were evolved
in the temples at Nippur as we know from a few fragments of large five
column tablets.(11) The completed composite liturgies or canonical
breviaries as they finally received form throughout Sumer in the Isin
period were made by selecting old songs of lament and praise and
re-editing them so as to develop theological ideas. Characteristic of
these final song services is the titular litany as the penultimate song
and a final song as an intercession. A considerable number of such
perfected services exist in the Berlin collection. These were obtained
apparently from Sippar.(12) The writer has made special efforts to
reconstruct the Sumerian canonical series as they existed in the age of
Isin and the first Babylonian dynasty. On the basis of tablets not
excavated at Nippur but belonging partly to the University Museum and
partly to the Berlin collection the writer restored the greater part of an
Enlil liturgy in part 2, pp. 155-167.(13) In the present and final part of
this volume another Enlil liturgy has been largely reconstructed on pages
290-306.(14) From these two partially reconstructed song services the
reader will obtain an approximate idea of the elaborate liturgical worship
of the late Sumerian period. These were adopted by the Babylonians and
Assyrians as canonical and were employed in interlinear editions by these
Semitic peoples. Naturally the liturgical remains of the Babylonian and
Assyrian breviaries are much more numerous and on the basis of these the
writer was able in previous volumes to identify and reconstruct a large
number of the Sumerian canonical musical services. But a large measure of
success has not yet attended his efforts to reconstruct the original
unilingual liturgies commonly written on one huge tablet of ten columns.
Obviously the priestly schools of the great religious center at Nippur
possessed these perfected prayer books but their great size was fatal to
their preservation. It must be admitted that the Nippur collection has
contributed almost nothing from the great canonical Sumerian liturgies
which surely existed there.

Much better is the state of preservation of the precanonical liturgies, or
long song services constructed by simply joining a series of _kišubs_ or
songs of prostration. These _kišub_ liturgies are the basis of the more
intricate canonical liturgies and in this aspect the Nippur collection
surpasses in value all others. Canonical and perfected breviaries may be
termed liturgical compositions and the precanonical breviaries may be
described as liturgical compilations, if we employ “composition” and
“compilation” in their exact Latin sense. Since Sumerian song services of
the earlier type, that is liturgical compilations, are more extensively
represented in the Nippur temple library than in any other, this is an
appropriate place to give an exact description of this form of prayer
service which preceded and prepared the way to the greatest system of
musical ritual in any ancient religion. If we may judge from the literary
remains of Nippur now in the University Museum, the priestly schools of
temple music in that famous city were extremely conservative about
abandoning the ancient liturgical compilations. These daily song services,
all of sorrowful sentiment and invariably emphasizing humility and human
suffering, are constructed by simply compiling into one breviary a number
of ancient songs, selected in such manner that all are addressed to one
deity. In this manner arose intricate choral compilations of length
suitable to a daily prayer, each addressed to a great god. Hence we have
in the temple libraries throughout Sumer and Babylonia liturgies to each
of the great gods. Even in the less elaborate _kišub_ compilations there
is in many cases revealed a tendency to recast and arrange the collection
of songs upon deeper principles. A tendency to include in all services a
song to the wrathful word of the gods and a song to the sorrowful earth
mother is seen even in the Nippurian breviaries of the precanonical type.
I need not dilate here upon the great influence which these principles
exercised upon the beliefs and formal worship of Assyria and Babylonia,
upon the late Jewish Church and upon Christianity. The personified word of
god and the worship of the great _mater dolorosa_, or the virgin goddess,
are ancient Sumerian creations whose influence has been effective in all
lands.

As examples of the liturgical compilation texts the reader is referred
especially to the following tablets. On pages 290-292 the writer has
described the important compiled liturgy found by CHARLES VIROLLEAUD.(15)
It is an excellent example of a Nippurian musical prayer service. It
contained eleven _kišubs_, or prayers, and they are recast in such manner
that the whole set forth one idea which progresses to the end. The liturgy
has in fact almost reached the stage of a composition. And in these same
pages the reader will see how this service finally resulted in a canonical
liturgy, for the completed product has been recovered. On pages 309-310
will be found a fragment, part of an ancient liturgy to Enlil of the
compiled type. Here again we are able to produce at least half of the
great liturgy into which the old service issued. In the preceding part of
this volume, pages 184-187, is given the first song of a similar liturgy
addressed to the mother goddess.

Undoubtedly the most important liturgical tablet which pertains to the
ordinary cults in the Nippur collection is discussed on pages 279-285. The
breviary, which probably belongs to the cult of the moon-god, derives
importance from its great length, its theological ideas, especially the
mention of the messengers which attend the Logos or Word of Enlil, and its
musical principles. Here each song has an antiphon which is unusual in
precanonical prayer books of the ordinary cults.(16) Students of the
history of liturgies will be also particularly interested in the unique
breviary compiled from eight songs of prostration, a lamentation for the
ancient city of Keš with theological references. This song service was
popular at Nippur, for remains of at least two copies have been found in
the collection. A translation is given on pages 311-323.

The oldest public prayer services consisted of only one psalm or song. A
good number of these ancient psalms are known from other collections,
especially from those of the British Museum. In view of the conservative
attitude of the liturgists at Nippur it is indeed surprising that so few
of the old temple songs have survived as they were originally employed;
ancient single song liturgies in this collection are rare. The following
list contains all the notable psalms of this kind. RADAU, _Miscellaneous
Sumerian Texts_ No. 3(17) is a lamentation of the mother goddess and her
appeal to Enlil on behalf of various cities which had been visited by wars
and other afflictions. RADAU, _ibid._, No. 16 has the rubric
_ki-šu_(_18_)_ sìr-gal __d__Enlil_, “A prayer of prostration, a great song
unto Enlil.” A psalm of the weeping mother goddess similar in construction
to RADAU No. 3 is edited on pages 260-264 of this volume.(19) No. 7 of
this part, edited on pages 276-279, is an excellent illustration of the
methods employed in developing the old single song psalms into compiled
liturgies. Here we have a short song service to the moon god constructed
by putting together two ancient psalms. The rubrics designate them as
_sagar_ melodies,(20) or choral songs, and adds that it is sung to the
lyre.(21) An especially fine psalm of a liturgical character was
translated on pages 115-117. It is likewise a lament to the sorrowful
mother goddess.

The student of Sumero-Babylonian religion will not fail to comment upon
one remarkable lacuna in the religious literature of every Sumerian city
which has been excavated. Prayers of the private cults are almost entirely
nonexistent. Later Babylonian religion is rich in penitential psalms
written in Sumerian for use in private devotions. These are known by the
rubric _eršagģunga_, or prayers to appease the heart. Only one has been
found in the Nippur collection,(22) and none at all have been recovered
elsewhere. Seals of Sumerians showing them in the act of saying their
private prayers abound from the earliest period. Most of these seals
represent the worshipper saluting a deity with a kiss thrown with the
hand. The attitude was described as _šu-illa_, or “Lifting of the Hand.”
Semitic prayers of the lifting of the hand abound in the religion of
Babylonia and Assyria. Here they are prayers employed in the incantation
ritual. We know from the great catalogue of Sumerian liturgical literature
compiled by the Assyrians that the Sumerians had a large number of prayers
of the lifting of the hand.(23) In Sumerian religion these were apparently
purely private prayers unconnected with the rituals of atonement. At any
rate the Nippur collections in Constantinople and Philadelphia contain a
large number of incantation services for the atonement of sinners and the
afflicted. These resemble and are the originals of the Assyrian
incantation texts of the type _utukku limnuti_, and contain no prayers
either by priest (_kišub_ in later terminology is the rubric of priest’s
prayers in incantations) or by penitent (_šu-il-la’s_). The absence of
prayers of private devotion in the temple library of Nippur is absolutely
inexplicable. Does it mean that the Sumerians were so deficient in
providing for the religious cure of the individual? Their emphasis of the
social solidarity of religion is truly in remarkable contrast to the
religious individualism of the Semite. But the Sumerian historical
inscriptions often contain remarkable prayers of individuals. The seals
emphasize the act of private devotion. The catalogue of their prayers
states that they possessed a good literature for private devotions. When
one considers the evidence which induces to assume that they possessed
such a literature, its total absence in every Sumerian collection is an
enigma which the writer fails to explain.

In the introduction to part two of this volume(24) the writer has
emphasized the peculiarly rich collection of tablets in this collection
pertaining to the cults of deified kings. In the present part is published
a most important tablet of that class. This liturgy of the compiled type
in six _kišubs_ sung in the cult of the god-man Ishme-Dagan, fourth king
of the Isin dynasty, is unique in the published literature of Sumer. Its
musical intricacy and theological importance have been duly defined on
pages 245-247. With the publication of these texts the important song
services of the cults of deified kings are exhausted. In addition to the
texts of this class translated or noted in part two, I call attention to
the very long text concerning Dungi, king of Ur, published by BARTON,
_Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions_ No. 3. In that extremely long poem
in six columns of about 360 lines(25) there are no rubrics, which shows at
once that it is not a cult song service. Moreover, Dungi had not been
deified when the poem was written. It is really an historical poem to this
king whose deification had at any rate not yet been recognized at Nippur.
It belongs in reality to the same class of literature as the historical
poem on his father Ur-Engur, translated on pages 126-136.

The only Sumerian cult songs to deified kings not in the Nippur collection
have now been translated by the writer and made accessible for wider
study. One hymn to Ur-Engur which proves that he had been canonized at his
capitol in Ur will be found in the _Proceedings of the Society of Biblical
Literature_, 1918, 45-50. The twelfth song of a liturgy to Ishme-Dagan
published by ZIMMERN from the Berlin collection is translated on pages
52-56 of the same article. Finally a long liturgy to Libit-Ishtar, son of
Ishme-Dagan, likewise in Berlin, has been translated there on pages
69-79.(26) Since the Berlin texts probably came from Sippar their
existence in that cult is important. For they prove not only the practice
of cult worship of deified kings in that city, but the domination of Isin
over this north Semitic city is thus documented for a period as late as
Libit-Ishtar.

Nearly all the existing prayer services in the cults of the deified kings
of Ur and Isin are now published and translated. The student will observe
that they are all of the compiled type but that there is in most cases
much musical arrangement and striving for combined effect. A few, and
especially the Ishme-Dagan liturgy published as No. 1 of this part, reveal
theological speculation and an effort to give the institution of god-man
worship its proper place in their religion. The hymns of these cults
comparatively so richly represented in this volume will be among the most
interesting groups of religious texts supplied by the excavations at
Nippur.(27)

OXFORD, July 9, 1919.





LAMENTATION OF ISHME-DAGAN OVER NIPPUR. 13856 (NO. 1)


The liturgical character of this tablet is unique among all the numerous
choral compositions of the Isin period. It is a large two column tablet
containing six long _kišub_ melodies. Liturgies of such kind, compiled by
joining a series of _kišubs_, or melodies, attended by prostrations,
represent an advanced stage in the evolution of these compositions in that
the sections are not mechanically joined together by selecting older
melodies without much regard for their connection, but as a whole they are
apparently original compositions so arranged that they develop a motif
from the beginning to the end of the liturgy. Choral services composed of
_kišubs_ in the cults of deified kings have been found(28) wherein the
deeds and personality of the king are sung, his divine claims are
emphasized and his Messianic promises rehearsed. But the liturgy here
published resembles in literary style the classical lamentations which
always formed the chief temple services of Sumer and Babylonia. It more
especially resembles the weeping mother liturgies, but here Ishme-Dagan
appears in the lines of the service in a rôle similar to that of the
sorrowful mother goddess of the ordinary liturgies, as he weeps for
Nippur.

“Her population like cattle of the fields within her have perished. Helas
my land I sigh.”

So reads a line from the second melody.

Lines of similar character occur repeatedly in the laments of the mother
goddess as she weeps for her people in the standard liturgies. In other
words, the cult of the deified kings issues here into its logical result.
The god man created to live and die for his people usurps the sphere of
the earth mother herself. And like her he is intimately associated with
the fortunes of mankind, of nature and all living creatures. The great
gods and the hosts of their attendants rule over man and the various
phases of the universe from afar. But the mother goddess is the
incarnation of fruitful nature, the mother of man whose joys and sorrows
she feels. So also in this remarkable liturgy the deified son of the great
gods lives among men, becomes their patron and divine companion.

The tablet contained originally about fifty lines in each column, or 200
in all. About one-third of the first column is gone. The first melody
contained at least fifty lines and ended somewhere shortly after the first
line of Col. II of the obverse. It began by relating how Enlil had ordered
the glory of Nippur, and then had become angered against his city, sending
upon it desolation at the hands of an invader. When we take up the first
lines of Obv. II we are well into the second melody which represents
Ishme-Dagan mourning for fathers and mothers who had been separated from
their children; for brothers who had been scattered afar; for the cruel
reign of the savage conqueror who now rules where the dark-headed people
had formerly dwelled in peace.

At about the middle of Obv. II begins the third melody which consists of
38 lines extending to Rev. I 19. In this section the psalmist ponders upon
the injustice of his city’s fate, and looks for the time when her woes
will cease, and Enlil will be reconciled.

The fourth section begins at line 24 of Rev. I and ended near the bottom
of this column which is now broken away. Here Ishme-Dagan joins with the
psalmists weeping for Nippur.

Section 5 began near the end of Rev. I, and ends at line 16 of Rev. II.
Here begins the phase of intercession to Enlil to repent and revenge
Nippur upon the foe. Section 6, beginning at Rev. II 17, probably
continued to the end of the column and the tablet. Here the liturgy
promises the end of Nippur’s sorrow. Enlil has ordered the restoration of
his city and has sent Ishme-Dagan, his beloved shepherd, to bring joy unto
the people.

After sections 2 and 3 follows the antiphon of one or two lines. The ends
of sections 1 and 4 are lost but we may suppose that antiphons stood here
also. Section 5 does not have an antiphon. Since section 6 ended the
liturgy it is not likely that an antiphon stood there.

[Transcriber’s Note: In the original book, throughout the book, all of the
transcriptions and translations were done in two columns. The left column
showed the transcription, and the right the English translation; each line
had the line number. In this e-book, the transcription and translation of
each line will be shown in succeeding lines.]

PSALM TO ENLIL CONTAINING A LONG INTERCESSION BY THE MOTHER GODDESS. 15204
(NO. 5)


This liturgical psalm in one melody adds one more document of this kind to
the classical Sumerian corpus of old short musical services on which the
later complex liturgies were based.(162) The title, _árabu-(ģu) árabu-(ģu)
múzu kúrra munmállašu záe alménna_, arranged in seven dactyls, does not
appear in the catalogue of old songs given in the Assyrian list, IV Raw.
53 Col. III. Since the greater part of the psalm consists in an address of
the mother goddess to Enlil on behalf of Nippur, the composition is
defined as an adoration of “my mother,”(163) an epithet applied to Innini
by the singers in most liturgies. The psalm begins with twelve lines sung
by the choir and addressed to Enlil. They then in lines 13-15 introduce
Innini whom they represent in discourse before Enlil in lines 16-47. This
part of the song service contains refrains characteristic of public
worship. Theologically the text illustrates one of the most profound
principles of Sumerian religion, the sympathy and concern of the virgin
mother for mankind.(164) The great daily services of the standard prayer
books represent her as a _mater dolorosa_ and she with Tammuz shares the
vicissitudes of mortal life. Our text is unique and noteworthy for one
salient fact. It illustrates the scenes so common on Babylonian seals,
where the mother goddess stands in intercession before the god, with one
or both hands raised in supplication and the left foot advanced as though
about to set it on the paved approach to the throne of the deity.

1. _arâ-bu-(ģu) arâ-bu-(ģu) mu-zu kur-ra mu-un-ma-al-la-šú_
1. Oh bird _arabu, arabu_,(165) thou art he whose name is proclaimed in

LAMENTATION ON THE PILLAGE OF LAGASH BY THE ELAMITES. 2154 (NO. 6)


This neatly written but seriously damaged single column tablet carried
when complete about fifty-five lines. In style the liturgical lamentation
has a striking resemblance to the lamentation on the invasion of Sumer by
the people of Gutium, published in the author’s _Sumerian Liturgical
Texts_, 120-124. The same refrain, “How long? oh my destroyed city and my
destroyed temple, sadly I wail,” distinguishes both compositions.(183)
Other lines are common to both threnodies. The contents are similar to the
lamentation on Lagash published in _Cuneiform Texts_ of the British
Museum, Vol. XV 22, of which ZIMMERN has published a variant VAT. 617 Rev.
II 10-42, in his _Sumerische Kultleider_. A translation of the British
Museum text will be found in the author’s _Sumerian and Babylonian
Psalms_, p. 284, an edition which can now be improved.

LAMENTATION TO INNINI ON THE SORROWS OF ERECH. 13859 (POEBEL NO. 26)


This well preserved single column tablet is published by POEBEL in PBS. V
26. The composition reflects the standard theological ideas found in the
canonical psalms and liturgies. The mother goddess Innini is represented
as a divine mother wailing for the misery of her city and her people. The
calamity consists in the pillage of the city and its holy places by a
foreign invader, who is repeatedly compared to an ox. Like the ordinary
psalms of public service the singers abruptly introduce the goddess
speaking in the first person as in lines 16; 18-20; 33-4. But the
lamentation does not have refrains and at the end the style approaches
nearly that of a prayer. The tablet also bears no liturgical note at the
end. For these reasons and because of the general impression which the
lines leave with the present interpreter, he classifies this text as the
product of a scholastic liturgist of the Ur or Isin period whose work was
not incorporated into the corpus of the official breviary.

LITURGICAL HYMN TO SIN. 8097 (NO. 7)


This liturgical composition consists of two melodies each designated by
the rubric _sagarram_, “It is a _sagar_.” The entire service is sung to
the _tigû_, a kind of flute. In the first melody of fifteen lines the
choir chant the glory of the moon god and his city Ur. The second melody
of twenty-four lines is apparently an address of the earth god Enlil to
his son the moon god. This melody must remain obscure as long as the
recurring liturgical phrase _áb-mu-ba-ši-in-dib_ is unexplained.

LAMENTATION ON THE DESTRUCTION OF UR. 7080 (NO. 11)


The fragment Ni. 7080 carries the right half of one of the largest
literary tablets in the Museum. Broken evenly at the center from top to
bottom the right half of this tablet preserves part of Col. III and all of
Cols. IV, V of the obverse. The reverse correspondingly contains Cols. I,
II and half of Col. III. Like so many similar liturgical compositions of
the period of Ur this lamentation is divided into a series of _kišubs_ or
songs, here of unusually great length. The third song ends at Obv. III 38;
its first line stood in Obv. II, which has been lost. The fourth song
began at Obv. III 42 and ends at Obv. IV 23, containing thirty-four lines.
The fifth song begins at Obv. IV 27 and ends at Obv. V 7, containing
forty-seven lines. In the following pages will be found a translation of
twenty-three lines of the end of the fourth song which describes the
wrathful word of the gods Anu and Enlil. The fifth song, a remarkable ode
to the wrathful word of Enlil, has been translated so far as the text
permits.

The sixth song begins at Obv. V 11, and probably terminated in the broken
passage at the top of Rev. I. Its length was also unusual, having at least
forty-five lines. This song was edited on a small tablet Ni. 4584 on which
the beginning and the end of the section are preserved. It has been
published as No. 10 in _Sumerian Liturgical Texts_, Vol. X of the
Publications of the Babylonian Section. Only a few lines at the
commencement of this song have been translated here. From this point
onward the language of the liturgy presents such difficulty that the
writer has been unable to offer a translation.

Section seven probably ended at the top of Rev. II and refers throughout
to the mother goddess who weeps over the ruins of Ur. The eighth song
probably began at the top of Rev. II and ended perhaps at the top of Rev.
III. It is another doleful ode to the weeping mother and many of its lines
are clear and translatable. The entire song is marked by sorrowful
refrains: _me-li-e-a uru-mu nu-me-a_, Oh woe is me, my city is no
more.(242) _a-uru-mu im-me_, How long? oh my city I cry.(243) _me-li-e-a
uru-ta è-a-mèn_, Oh woe is me, from the city I depart.(244) _dingir
ga-ša-an-gal-mèn é-ta è-a-mèn_, Great divine queen am I, from the temple I
depart.(245) _er-gig ni-šéš-šéš_, She weeps bitterly.(246)

Only the ends of lines of a large part of the ninth song are preserved in
Rev. III. The tenth song probably occupied most of the space in Rev. IV.
Speculation concerning the number of songs in the entire liturgy is
limited to the number of about 11-13. The liturgy was, therefore,
extremely long, attaining to a content of about 500 lines. We know from
the single tablet variant of the sixth song that another edition of this
series existed in which small tablets carried each a single _kišub_. A
similar condition of editorial redaction is revealed by ZIMMERN, KL. 200,
a small tablet which contains the twelfth song of a liturgy to the deified
king of Isin, Išme-Dagan.

The historical event referred to in this liturgy is undoubtedly the
destruction of Ur in the time of Ibi-Sin, last of the kings of the Ur
dynasty. This calamity left many traces in the temple songs of Sumer, and
the Sumerian prayer books of Nippur contain other lamentations on the fall
of Ur, written perhaps during the Isin period. The writer has already
published a single column tablet which rehearses the same catastrophe,
mentioning Ibi-Sin himself and naming the Elamites as his captors.(247)

LITURGICAL HYMNS OF THE TAMMUZ CULT. 3656 (MYHRMAN NO. 5)


The obverse of this fine single column tablet contained a hymn in
thirty-eight lines to the departed Tammuz. It represents the people
wailing for the lord of life who now sleeps in the lower world. Thirteen
lines have been completely broken away from the top. The reverse carried a
long liturgical song of the cult of this god in which the mother goddess
is represented wailing for her ravished lover. Songs of the weeping mother
are common enough in these wailings for Tammuz, but all other known
examples of this _motif_ represent the major unmarried type of mother
goddess Innini-Ishtar wandering on earth, crying for her departed son. The
hymn on our tablet reveals in a wholly unexpected manner the close
relation between the mother goddess Gula of Isin and Innini. It was known
that both sprang from a common source, a prehistoric unmarried goddess,
but one had hardly supposed that the liturgists went so far as to
introduce the married goddess of Isin in the rôle of the virgin mother
Innini. The great mother divinity of Isin, although attached in a loose
way to a male consort Ninurta, in that city retained, nevertheless, much
of her ancient unattached character. In the standard liturgies she is
almost invariably the type of Weeping mother, whereas Innini is this type
in the Tammuz liturgies. Since Gula of Isin was the ordinary liturgical
type we find the influence of the ordinary liturgies effective in the
composition of the Tammuz hymn. It explains the extraordinary phenomenon
of the introduction of a long passage (Rev. 3-10) from one of the wailing
liturgies. And the short litany refrain lines 11-20 is obviously an
imitation of numberless similar passages of the ordinary liturgies in
which the goddess wails for various temples; here only for Nippur and
Isin, since the composition was written for the services at Nippur in the
period of the Isin dynasty. In a most gratifying manner our tablet shows
how the lamentations of the mother goddess in the canonical prayer books
express sorrows for certain concrete misfortunes and certain defined
temples and cities and find their general expression in the lamentations
for Tammuz, the representative of all human vicissitudes. This edition has
been made from my own copy. The tablet was first published by MYHRMAN,
PBS. Vol. I No. 5, and by RADAU, BE. 30 No. 2. To these copies I have been
able to make only slight additions.

A LITURGY TO ENLIL, SERIES _E-LUM GUD-SUN_ (ZIMMERN KL. NO. 11)


The history of the text of this long and intricate Enlil liturgy
elucidates in unusual manner the evolution of Sumerian prayer books until
they attained canonical and permanent form. The earliest text of this
liturgy is partially preserved on the _Tablet Virolleaud_ published in the
_Revue d’Assyriologie_, Vol. XVI. The fragment was brought to Europe in
1909 by the assyriologist CHARLES VIROLLEAUD, having been purchased by him
during his excavations in Persia. It is light brown and varies from the
center to the edge by two inches to one inch in thickness. The fragment is
from the upper left corner of a large three(?) column tablet. About half
of the first melody is preserved on the obverse. The reverse preserves the
last two melodies. From their rubrics we learn that the entire series
contained eleven sections. This tablet has the rubric _ki-šub-gú_ after
each strophe. The titular litany(281) occupies as usual the next to the
last place but only the opening lines giving the _motif_ and a few titles
are given. The redactor indicates the remaining titles by a rubric
“(Recite the title) of a god until they are finished.” The rubric is in
Semitic which shows that the redaction was done by Semitic scholars.

The series as it finally issued from the hands of the liturgists in the
Isin period was written upon a huge five(?) column tablet, the lower half
of which has been published by ZIMMERN, _Altsumerische Kultlieder_, No.
11. Each column contained about fifty lines. There are no _giš-gí-gal_ or
antiphons after the melodies, ten of which I have been able to restore. By
borrowing from old songs and other liturgies the redactors have greatly
increased the length of this service. At least ten songs have been lost on
Cols. III, IV of the obverse and I, II of the reverse.

The late Assyrian redaction is mentioned in the catalogue of prayer books
IV Raw. 53 I 13 and in BL. No. 103 Obv. 13. SBH. No. 21, edited in SBP.
112-119, is tablet one of the late Babylonian School(282) and contains the
first four songs, duplicates of the first four on K.L. 11. SBH. No. 25,
edited in SBP. 120-123,(283) carries on the obverse two songs (_e-lum
di-da-ra_ and _me-e ur-ri men_) found on Col. III of K.L. No. 11, Rev., or
the two last melodies before the titular litany. A fragment published by
MEEK in BA. X pt. 1, No. 11, contains the end of _e-lum di-da-ra_ and all
of _me-e ur-ri men_. SBH. 25 and MEEK No. 11 belong to the series _e-lum
di-da-ra_, entered in the Assyrian catalogue, IV Raw. 53_a_ 8, and form
tablet _one_ of that service.

The titular litany of the _e-lum gud-sun_ series is identical (except for
some variants) with the famous titular litany of the mother goddess series
_mu-ten NU-NUNUZ gim-ma_, tablet _five_, edited in SBP. 149-167. Portions
of the titular litany of the Enlil series have been edited in PBS. X
155-167, see pages 163-4. The titular litany of _ní-ma-al gù-de-de_ occurs
at the end of tablet two of that series, SBP. 24-9 = BL. 72-3. Not every
series has a theological litany of this kind, which ordinarily comes
before the _er-šem-ma_, or intercessional song at the end. The song to the
“word,” which occurs in all series, is partially preserved on Obv. III and
begins _a-ma-ru na-nam_. The indispensable song to the weeping mother
comes just before the titular litany. This little nine-line melody _me-e
ur-ri-mèn me-e kàs-mèn_ must have been a national religious song. It was
copied into another Enlil song service as we have seen. The same song
introduces tablet _four_ of an Innini series of which we have only the end
of tablet _three_, K. 2759, in BL. 93 f.

Finally the reader will note that the first song _e-lum gud-sun_ of this
series has been copied into one of the tablets of _ame baranara_, SBH. No.
22 = SBP. 126 f. A fragment of some unknown series, K. 8603 = BL. 14 also
employs this song in the body of its text.

of a large four column tablet. It contained a series of _ki-šub_ melodies
which formed the prototype of the later Enlil series of which three
tablets have been edited by the writer, see _Sumerian Liturgical Texts_
167. It stands to the completed series as the similar tablet of the _e-lum
gud-sun_ series, Tablet Virolleaud, is related to its completed canonical
form in ZIMMERN, KL. 11. Both Ni. 11359 and Tablet Virolleaud show the
evolution of two great Enlil liturgies arrested midway in their evolution.
They still consist of unmethodically joined melodies. Both have the same
rubric at the end. The first melody of _d.__Babbar-gim-è-ta_ after line
four agrees with the first melody of the Enlil series _zi-bu-ù sud-du-ám_
in ZIMMERN, KL. 8 and 9 after line five of that series. A duplicate will
be found in BL. pp. 37-39, which see for critical notes on the
reconstructed text.

LITURGY OF THE CULT OF KES (NIPPUR FRAGMENTS AND ASHMOLEAN PRISM.)


Keš and Opis, two closely associated but unlocated southern cities of
Sumer, lay apparently somewhere in the region between Erech and Šuruppak.
So closely were they united that the same cult of the great mother goddess
obtained in both.(413) According to II Raw. 60_a_ 26, Innini of Hallab was
the queen of Keš. The Sumerian liturgy, BL. p. 54, names Nintud as the
goddess of this city, but the list of mother goddesses in PSBA. 1911 Pl.
XII calls her by the name Ninharsag,(414) where she is associated with
Ninmenna, epithet of the earth mother in Adab a city near Šuruppak. A
fragment, No. 102 in BL., reads her title at Keš as Aruru. These various
epithets all refer to the earth mother whose principal married type is
Ninlil. In fact one liturgy actually names Ninlil as the goddess of Keš,
SBP. 24, 74. On the other hand, a cult document of the Neo-Babylonian
period names Kallat Ekur, the bride of Ekur, as the goddess of _U-pi-ia_
or Opis, VS. VI. 213, 21.(415) The bride of Ekur is Ninlil. Thus the twin
cities Keš and Opis of Sumer with their cult of the earth mother Ninharsag
or Nintud were imitated in later times in Akkad and located on the Tigris
where Opis survived into Greek times (ωπις) and Keš seems to have become
confused in writing with Kiš a famous city near Babylon. At Opis in Akkad
a male satellite _Igi-du_ was associated with the mother goddess and we
may be safe in assuming that he was borrowed from the original southern
cult.(416) Of the names Ninharsag, Aruru, Nintud, Ninmah, Innini of
Hallab, we are not certain which one applied especially to Keš and Opis.
In any case the liturgy which we are about to discuss had some special
name for the goddess here. In a refrain which recurs at the end of each
melody the psalmists say that the god of Keš, that is probably Igidu,(417)
was made like Ašširgi, or Ninurta, and that its goddess was made like
Nintud, hence the _special_ name of the mother goddess in this liturgy
cannot have been Nintud.

So far as the text of this important liturgy in eight melodies can be
established, it leads to the inference that, like all other Sumerian
choral compositions, the subject is the rehearsal of sorrows which befell
a city and its temple. Here the glories of Keš, its temple and its gods
are recorded in choral song, and the woes of this city are referred to as
symbolic of all human misfortunes. The name of the temple has not been
preserved in the text. But we know from other liturgies that the temple in
Keš bore the name Uršabba.(418) The queen of the temple Uršabba is called
the mother of Negun, also a title of Ninurta in Elam.(419) The close
connection between the goddess of Keš and Ninlil is again revealed, for
Negun is the son of Ninlil in the theological lists, CT. 24, 26, 112.
Therefore at Keš we have a reflection of the Innini-Tammuz cult or the
worship of mother and son, mother goddess Ninlil or Ninharsag, and Igidu
or Negun.(420)

Keš and Opis must have been closely associated with both Erech and
Šuruppak, and of traditional veneration in Sumer. Keš is mentioned in a
list with Ur, Kullab (part of Erech) and Šuruppak, SMITH, _Miscellaneous
Texts_ 26, 5. Gudea speaks of a part of the temple in Lagash which was
pure as Keš and Aratta (i. e. Šuruppak).(421) The various mother goddesses
of Eridu, Kullab, Kêši, Lagaš and Šuruppak are invoked in an incantation,
CT. 16, 36, 1-9. The first melody of the Ashmolean Prism contains a
reference to the horse of Šuruppak.

The textual history of this liturgy is interesting. The major text is
written upon a four-sided prism now in the Ashmolean Museum of Oxford. The
object is eight inches high, four inches wide on each surface and is
pierced from top to bottom at the center by a small hole, so that the
liturgy could be turned on a spindle. The writer published a copy of this
prism or prayer wheel in his _Babylonian Liturgies_. The elucidation of
this exceedingly difficult text was lightened somewhat by the discovery of
a four column tablet in Constantinople, which originally contained the
entire text. It was afterwards published as No. 23 of my _Historical and
Religious Texts_. Since the edition of these two sources, the Nippur
Collection in Philadelphia has been found to contain several fragments of
the same liturgy. A portion of the redaction on several single column
tablets had been already published by RADAU in his _Miscellaneous Sumerian
Texts_, No. 8 (=Ni. 11876), last tablet of the series containing melodies
six, seven, and eight. I failed to detect the connection of RADAU’s tablet
at the time of the first edition but referred to it with a rendering in my
_Epic of Paradise_, p. 19. Another tablet, also from a single column
tablet redaction at Nippur, has been recovered in Philadelphia, Ni.
8384.(422) This text utilized here in transcription contains a section
marked number 4 on that tablet but all the other sources omit it. Hence
this redaction probably contained nine melodies. The new melody has been
inserted between melodies three and four of the standard text. If evidence
did not point otherwise the editor would have supposed that Ni. 8384 and
11876 belonged to the same tablet. But Ni. 8384 has melodies four, five
and six of its redaction with the catch-line of the next or its seventh
melody which partly duplicates the Radau tablet. Moreover, these two
tablets have not the same handwriting and differ in color and texture of
the clay. Finally a small fragment, Ni. 14031, contains the end of the
second melody and the beginning of the third on its obverse. The reverse
contains the end of the sixth melody. This small tablet undoubtedly
belongs to the four column tablet in Constantinople. The two fragments
became separated by chance when the Nippur Collection was divided between
Philadelphia and the Musée Imperial of Turkey. Ni. 14031 will be found in
my _Sumerian Liturgical Texts_, No. 22.

Under ordinary circumstances a text for which so many duplicates exist
should have yielded better results than I have been able to produce. But
the contents are still obscure owing largely to the bad condition of the
prism. My first rendering of the interesting refrain in which I saw a
reference to the creation of man and woman was apparently erroneous. The
refrain refers rather to the creation of the mother goddess of Keš and to
her giving birth to her son Negun.(423)

THIRD TABLET OF THE SERIES “THE EXALTED ONE WHO WALKETH” (_E-LUM DIDARA_)
(NO. 13)


The series _elum didara_ is entered in the Assyrian liturgical catalogue,
IV Raw. 53_a_ 8, and the first tablet of this Enlil liturgy has been found
in the Berlin collection and published by REISNER, SBH. No. 25.(477) The
Berlin tablet belongs to a great Babylonian temple library of the Greek
period redacted by a family of liturgists descendants of Sin-ibni. A
fragment of the same first tablet of another Babylonian copy has been
found, BM. 81-7-27, 203.(478) The catch line of tablet two is lost on SBH.
25 and no part of tablet two has been identified. In 1914 I copied BM.
78239 (=88-5-12, 94) the upper half of a large tablet carrying according
to the colophon ninety-six Sumerian lines. The number of lines provided
with an interlinear translation on this fragment is only two, which
increases the actual number of lines to ninety-eight. Probably a few more
should be added for Semitic lines on the lost portion. This tablet, also
from a Babylonian redaction, belongs to an edition made by another school
of liturgists and contains tablet three of _elum didara_.

The third tablet of _elum didara_ began with a melody _nin-ri nin-ri
gû-am-me_ to the mother goddess Bau (I. 2), who in line 7 is identified
with Nanâ. Lines 3-6 introduce by interpolation other local forms of the
mother goddess, as a concession to cities whose liturgists succeeded in
inserting these lines before the canon of sacred songs were closed in the
Isin period. Hence Babylon is favored by a reference to Zarpanit in line
3; Barsippa by a reference to Tašmet in lines 4-6. Bau or Gula wails for
Nippur whose destruction is here attributed to the moon-god, Sin. The
introduction of a long passage to the moon-god in the weeping mother
melody of an Enlil liturgy is unusual. The entire passage reflects the
phraseology and ideas of the well-known Sumerian hymn to the moon-god
_magur azag anna_.(479) The composer desiring to utilize these fine lines
makes a setting for them by describing Sin as the god who visited Nippur
with wrath, regardless of the inconsistency of placing such a passage in
an Enlil song service which attributed the sorrows of Nippur to Enlil
himself.

According to the catch line of tablet two of the Ninurta liturgy _gud-nim
kurra_ the third tablet of that series began by the same melody as tablet
three of the _elum didara_.(480) It is probable that the first melody of
tablet three of both series was identical. Melodies are always identified
by their first lines and when these agree we assume that the entire
melodies are identical. Since the musicians referred to all melodies by
their first lines it was manifestly impossible to begin two different
melodies with the same line. But tablet three of the weeping mother
liturgy _muten nu-nunuz-gim_ begins its first melody(481) _nin-ri nin-ri
gù-ám_, etc., otherwise both melodies differ completely. This is the first
known of example of two different melodies bearing the same title. It is
curious indeed that an Enlil, a Ninurta and a _mater dolorosa_ series all
begin their third tablets in the same manner.

The obverse of BM. 78239 breaks away before the end of the melody _nin-ri
ninri gú-ám-me_. Here forty-five Sumerian lines are lost; one or two
melodies at least stood in this break. For the last passage on tablet
three, the scribe borrows the first melody of the Ninurta series _gud-nim
kurra_.(482) The litanies which begin these melodies or series of
addresses to Ninurta differ greatly in the two redactions. Since SBH. No.
18 belongs to a Ninurta series the addresses therein are much more
extensive. The composer of the Enlil series _elum didara_ obviously
introduced this irrelevant melody to obtain the fine passage to the
weeping mother, Rev. 10-21 on BM. 78239. These lines are lost on the
Berlin text SBH. No. 18. On the whole the liturgy _elum didara_ is more
inconsistent in the development of ideas than any song service of which
extensive portions are known. Only tablets one and three are as yet
identified and neither of these is much more than half complete.

BABYLONIAN CULT SYMBOLS. 6060 (NO. 12)


Ni. 6060, a Cassite tablet in four columns, yields a notable addition to
the scant literature we now possess concerning Babylonian mystic symbols.
A fragmentary Assyrian copy from the library of Ašurbanipal was published
by ZIMMERN as No. 27 of his _Ritual Tafeln_. The Assyrian copy contains
only fifteen symbols with their mystic identifications, in Col. II of the
obverse. The ends of the lines of the right half of Col. I are preserved
on ZIMMERN 27, and these are all restored by the Cassite original. The
obverse of these two restored tablets contained about sixty symbols with
their divine implications. Most of them are the names of plants, metals,
cult utensils and sacrificial animals, each being identified with a deity.
A tablet in the British Museum, dated in the 174th year of the Seleucid
era or 138 B. C., Spartola Collection I 131, published by STRASSMAIER, ZA.
VI 241-4, begins with an astronomical myth concerning the summer and
winter solstices(503) and then inserts a passage on the mystic meanings of
ten symbols. The myth of the solstices runs as follows:

“In the month Tammuz, 11th day, when the deities Miniṭṭi and Kaṭuna,
daughters of Esagila,(504) go unto Ezida(505) and in the month Kislev, 3d
day, when the deities Gazbaba and Kazalsurra, daughters of Ezida, go unto
Esagila—Why do they go? In the month Tammuz the nights are short. To
lengthen the nights the daughters of Esagila go unto Ezida. Ezida is the
house of night. In the month Kislev, when the days are short, the
daughters of Ezida to lengthen the days go unto Esagila. Esagila is the
house of day.” The tablet then explains the Sumerian ideogram
_gubarra_=Ašrat, the western mother goddess Ashtarte, and says that Ašrat
of Ezida is poverty stricken.(506) But Ašrat of Esagila is full of light
and mighty.(507) Some mystic connection between Ašrat or Geštinanna,
mistress of letters and astrology,(508) scribe of the lower world, and the
daughters of night and day existed. This cabalistic tablet here refers to
a mirror which she holds in her hand and says she appeared on the 15th day
to order the decisions. The 15th of the month Tammuz is probably referred
to or the beginning of the so-called dark period when the days begin to
shorten and Nergal the blazing sun descends to the lower world to remain
160 days.(509) For some reason Ašrat, here called the queen,(510) appears
to order the decisions, probably the fates of those that die. The phrase
“The divine queen appeared” is usually said of the rising of stars or
astral bodies, but the reference here is wholly obscure. As a star she was
probably Virgo. At any rate some mystic pantomime must have been enacted
in the month of Tammuz in which the daughters of Esagila and Ezida and the
queen recorder of Sheol were the principal figures. The pantomime
represented the passing of light, the reign of night and the judgment of
the dead. Clearly an elaborate ritual attended by magic ceremonies
characterized the ceremony. At this point the tablet gives a commentary on
the mystic meaning of cult objects used for the healing of the sick or the
atonement of a sinner. Obviously some connection exists between this
mystagogy and the myth described. The commentary is probably intended to
explain the hidden powers of the objects employed in the weird ritual, at
any rate the mystery is thus explained.(511)

(1) Gypsum is the god Ninurta.(512) (2) Pitch is _the asakku_-demon.(513)
(3) Meal water (which encloses the bed of the sick man) is Lugalgirra and
Meslamtaea.(514) [A string of wet meal was laid about the bed of a sick
man or about any object to guard them against demons. Hence meal water
symbolizes the two gods who guard against demons. See especially EBELING,
KTA. No. 60 Obv. 8 _zisurrá talamme-šu_, “Thou shalt enclose him with meal
water.”]

(4) Three meal cakes are Anu, Enlil and Ea.(515) (5) The design which is
drawn before the bed is the net which overwhelms all evil. (6) The hide of
a great bull is Anu. [Here the hide of the bull is the symbol of the
heaven god as of Zeus Dolichaîos in Asia Minor.]

(7) The copper gong(516) is Enlil. But in our tablet II 13 symbol of
Nergal and in CT. 16, 24, 25 apparently of Anu. The term of comparison in
any case is noise, bellowing.

(8) The great reed spears which are set up at the head of the sick man are
the seven great gods sons of Išhara. The seven sons of Išhara are unknown,
but this goddess was a water and vegetation deity closely connected with
Nidaba goddess of the reed.(517) The reed, therefore, symbolizes her sons.

(9) The scapegoat is Ninamašazagga. Here the scapegoat typifies the genius
of the flocks who supplies the goat. See, however, another explanation
below Obv. II 17.

(10) The censer is Azagsud. The deity Azagsud in both theological and cult
texts is now male and now female. As a male deity he is the great priest
of Enlil, CT. 24, 10, 12, and always a god of lustration closely connected
with the fire god Gibil, MEEK, BA. X pt. 1 No. 24,4.(518) But ordinarily
Azagsud is a form of the grain goddess who was also associated with fire
in the rites of purification. As a title of the grain goddess, see CT. 24,
9, 35 = 23, 17; SBP. 158, 64 _A-sug_ where ZIMMERN, KL. 11 Rev. III 11 has
_Azag-sug_. She is frequently associated with Ninḫabursildu and Nidaba
(the grain goddess) in rituals, ZIMMERN, Rt. 126, 27 and 29; 138, 14, etc.
The censer probably symbolizes both male and female aspects, the fire that
burns and the grain that is burned. See below II 9, where the censer is
symbol of Urashâ a god of light.

(11) The torch is Nusku the fire god in the Nippur pantheon. Below (II 10)
the torch is Gibil, fire god in the Eridu pantheon.

The mystic identifications do not always agree, but the term of comparison
can generally be found if the origin and character of the deities are
known and the nature of the symbol determined. Each god was associated
with an animal and a plant and with other forms of nature over which they
presided. When the cult utensils are symbols the term of comparison is
generally clear. Below will be found such interpretations of these
mysteries as the condition of the tablet and the limits of our knowledge
permit. Most difficult of all are the metal symbols which begin with Obv.
I 10. Here silver is heaven, but it can hardly be explained after the
manner of the same connection of Zeus Dolichaîos with silver in Kommagene.
The cult of this Asiatic heaven god is said to have been chiefly practiced
at a city in the region of silver mines.(519) That is an impossible
explanation in the case of Anu whose chief cult center was at Erech. The
association of gold with Enmesharra, here obviously the earth god, is
completely unintelligible. In Obv. I 31 he is possibly associated with
lead or copper as the planet Saturn. In lines I 14-18 the symbols are
broken away, but they are probably based upon astronomy. Metals seem to be
connected with fixed stars and planets on the principle of color. The
metallic symbolism of the planets was well known to Byzantine writers who
did not always agree in these matters. Their identifications are certainly
a Græco-Roman heritage which in turn repose upon Babylonian
tradition.(520) The following table taken from COOK, _Zeus_, p. 626, will
illustrate Græco-Roman ideas on this point:

Kronos—lead (Saturn); Zeus—silver (Jupiter); Ares—iron (Mars); Helios—gold
(Sun); Aphrodite—tin (Venus); Hermes—bronze (Mercury); Selene—crystal
(Moon).

Our tablet preserves only the names of the deities at this point, and if
metals stood at the left we are clearly authorized to interpret the divine
names in their astral sense. This assumes, of course, that these astral
identifications obtained in the Cassite period. Assuming this hypothesis
we should have the metals for Betelgeuze, Ursa Major, Venus, Jupiter,
Mars, Saturn, New-moon(?), a star in Orion, Venus as evening and morning
star, Virgo, and perhaps others.

The reverse of the tablet is even more mystic and subtle. The first
section connects various cult substances with parts of the body. White
wine and its bottle influence the eyes. White figs pertain to a woman’s
breasts. Must or mead have power over the limbs as the members of motion.
Terms of comparison fail to suggest themselves here and we are completely
disconcerted by the fancy of the Babylonian mystagogue. In the next
section, which is only partially preserved, we have twelve gods of the
magic rituals. The province of each in relation to the city and state is
defined. Kushu, the evil satyr who receives the sin-bearing scapegoat,
hovers over the homes of men. Muḫru, the deity who receives burnt
offerings, or incarnation of the fires of sacrifice, dwells at the
city-gate. Sakkut, a god of light and war, inexplicably protects the
pools. Then follow hitherto undefined and unknown Cassite deities and a
break in the tablet.

As in the Assyrian duplicate, ZIMMERN Rt. 27, so also here, the reverse
contains a lexicographical commentary on mythological phrases. The name of
the god _Negun_ is commented upon here and most timely information is
given. Both the phonetic reading of the name and the character of the
deity are defined. The colophon at the end has the usual formula attached
to cult instructions whose contents are forbidden to the uninitiated.

ADDENDUM ON OBV. I 10 F.


Anu in this passage really denotes Sin, the moon, which has been connected
with silver on account of its color. The identification of Anu, the heaven
god, with the moon god rests upon the astronomical connection between the
moon and the summer solstice, see WEIDNER, _Handbuch der Babylonischen
Astronomie_, 32. Sin is called “Anu of heaven,” KING, _Magic_, No. I, 9,
and for the connection with silver, see VIROLLEAUD, _Astrologie_,
Supplement, V II, _kaspu __ilu__ A-nu huraṣu __ilu__ Enlil erû __ilu__
Ea_. Enlil is connected with gold in VIROLLEAUD, _Astrologie_, Second
Supplement, XVII 14, and Enlil is not infrequently identified with
Shamash, see p. 158, 1-2 and p. 308, 18, and gold is the traditional metal
of the sun.

The Greek identification of Zeus, the sky-god, with silver is certainly
borrowed from Babylonia; see p. 334.

FOOTNOTES


    1 In addition to the examples of epical poems and hymns cited on pages
      103-5 of this volume note the long mythological hymn to Innini, No.
      3 and the hymn to Enlil, No. 10 of this part. An unpublished hymn to
      Enlil, Ni. 9862, ends _a-a __d__En-lil zag-sal_, “O praise father
      Enlil.” For Ni. 13859, cited above p. 104, see POEBEL, PBS. V No.
      26.

    2 So far as the term is properly applied. Being of didactic import it
      was finally attached to grammatical texts in the phrase _d__Nidaba
      zag-sal_, “O praise Nidaba,” i. e., praise the patroness of writing.

    3 POEBEL, PBS. V No. 25; translated in the writer’s _Le Poème Sumérien
      du Paradis_, 220-257. Note also a similar epical poem to Innini
      partial duplicate of POEBEL No. 25 in MYHRMAN’S _Babylonian Hymns
      and Prayers_, No. 1. Here also the principal actors are Enki, his
      messenger Isimu, and “Holy Innini” as in the better preserved epic.
      Both are poems on the exaltation of Innini.

    4 Ni. 9205 published by BARTON, _Miscellaneous Babylonian
      Inscriptions_, No. 4. This text is restored by a tablet of the late
      period published by PINCHES in JRAS. 1919.

    5 Ni. 7847, published in this part, No. 3 and partially translated on
      pages 260-264.

    6 Undoubtedly Ni. 11327, a mythological hymn to Enki in four columns,
      belongs to this class. It is published as No. 14 of this part. A
      similar _zagsal_ to Enki belongs to the Constantinople collection,
      see p. 45 of my _Historical and Religious Texts_.

_    7 Historical and Religious Texts_, pp. 14-18.

    8 See PSBA. 1919, 34.

    9 One of the most remarkable tablets in the Museum is Ni. 14005, a
      didactic poem in 61 lines on the period of pre-culture and
      institution of Paradise by the earth god and the water god in
      Dilmun. Published by BARTON, _Miscellaneous Babylonian
      Inscriptions_, No. 8. The writer’s exegesis of this tablet will be
      found in _Le Poème Sumérien du Paradis_, 135-146. It is not called a
      _zag-sal_ probably because the writer considered the tablet too
      small to be dignified by that rubric. Similar short mythological
      poems which really belong to the _zag-sal_ group are the following:
      hymn to Shamash, RADAU, _Miscel._ No. 4; hymn to Ninurta as creator
      of canals, RADAU, BE. 29, No. 2, translated in BL., 7-11; hymn to
      Nidaba, RADAU, _Miscel._ No. 6.

   10 Ni. 112; see pp. 172-178.

   11 For example, MYHRMAN, No. 3; RADAU, _Miscel._ No. 13; both canonical
      prayer books of the weeping mother class. For a liturgy of the
      completed composite type in the Tammuz cult, see RADAU, BE. 30, Nos.
      1, 5, 6, 8, 9.

   25 Less than half the tablet is preserved.

   26 Note that this breviary of the cult of Libit-Ishtar terminates with
      two ancient songs, one to Innini and one to Ninâ, both types of the
      mother goddess who was always intimately connected with the god-men
      as their divine mother.

   28 The twelfth _kišub_ of a liturgy to Ishme-Dagan is published in
      ZIMMERN’S _Kultlieder_, No. 200. A somewhat similar song service of
      the cult of this king has been published in the writer’s _Sumerian
      Liturgical Texts_, 178-187. A portion of a series to Dungi was
      published by RADAU in the _Hilprecht Anniversary Volume_, No. 1. The
      liturgy to Libit-Ishtar in ZIMMERN, K L. 199 I—Rev. I 7, is composed
      of a series of _sa-(bar)-gid-da_.

_   29 na-ba-_ is for _nam-ba_, emphatic prefix. See PBS. X pt. 1 p. 76 n.
      4. Cf. _na-ri-bi_, verily she utters for thee, BE. 30, No. 2, 20.

   30 On the philological meaning of this name, see VAB. IV 126, 55.

   31 For the suffixes _eš_, _uš_, denoting plural of the object, see
      _Sum. Gr._ p. 168.

   32 On _ki-dúr-gar_ cf. Gudea, Cyl. B 12, 19.

   33 Usually written _dù-azag_, throne room. On the meaning of _du_ in
      this word, see AJSL. 33, 107. Written also _dû-azag_, in Ni. 11005
      II 9.

   34 Cf. Gudea, Cyl. A 25, 14, the _kin-gi_ of the _unu-gal_.

   35 Br. 7720. The sign _TE_ is here _gunufied_. Cf. OBI. 127, Obv. 5.

_   36 Tin_ alone may mean “wine,” as in Gudea, Cyl. B, 5, 21; 6, 1. See
      also NIKOLSKI, No. 264, _duk-tin_, a jar of wine.

_   37 a-gim_ = _dimêtu_, ban, SBH. 59, 25. _a-gim ģe-im-bal-e_, The ban
      may he elude, Ni. 11065 Rev. II 25. Unpublished. The line is not
      entirely clear; cf. BRÜNNOW, No. 3275.

   38 For _en-na_ in the sense of “while,” see PERY, _Sin_ in LSS. page
      41, 16.

   39 The sign is imperfectly made on the tablet.

   40 Cf. SBP. 328, 11.

_   41 ḪA_ is probably identical in usage with _PEŠ_, and the idea common
      to both is “be many, extensive, abundant.” Note ZIMMERN,
      _Kultlieder_ 19 Rev. has _ḪA_ where SBP. 12, 2 has _PEŠ_. _šu-peš_
      occurs in Gudea, Cyl. A 16, 23; 11, 9; 19, 9 and CT. 15, 7, 27.

   42 On _ugu-de_ = _ḇalāku, na’butu_, to run away, see DELITZSCH,
      _Glossar_ p. 43. Also _ugu-bi-an-de-e_, V R. 25_a_ 17; _ù-gù-dé_,
      RA. 10, 78, 14; _ú-gu ba-an-dé_, if he run away, VS. 13, 72 9 and
      84, 11, with variant 73, 11 _u-da-pa-ar_ = _udtappar_, if he take
      himself away. _ú-gu-ba-an-de-zu_, when thou fleest, BE. 31, 28, 23.
      _ú-gu-ba-de_, GENOUILLAC, _Inventaire_ 944; CLAY _Miscellen_ 28 V
      71: _má ú-gu-ba-an-de_, “If a boat float away,” _ibid._ _IV_ 14. See
      also GRANT AJSL. 33, 200-2.

   43 Sic! _gú-sa-bi_ is expected; cf. RA. 11, 145, 31 _gú-sa-bi_ =
      _napḫar-šu-nu_.

   44 Sign obliterated; the traces resemble _SU_.

   45 Read perhaps _dū-šub_ = _nadû ša rigmi_, to shout loudly. Cf. _dúg
      sir-ra šub-ba-a-zu_ = _rigme zarbiš addiki_, ASKT. 122, 12. Passim
      in astrological texts.

   46 The tablet has _MAŠ_. The Semitic would be _adi mati kabattu
      iparrad_.

_   47 ri_ is apparently an emphatic element identical in meaning with
      _ám_; cf. SBP. 10, 7-12. Note _ri_, variant of _nam_, SBH. 95, 23 =
      ZIMMERN, KL. 12 I 8.

   48 Sic! Double plural. _eš_ probably denotes the past tense, see _Sum.
      Gr._ § 224.

   49 Sign BRÜNNOW, No. 11208.

   50 The first melody or liturgical section probably ended somewhere in
      this lost passage at the top of Col. II.

   51 Text _A-ÁŠ_!

   52 The subject is Ishme-Dagan.

   53 The sign is a clearly made BR. No. 10275 but probably an error for
      10234. For _sùr-ri-eš_ see BA. V 633, 22; SBH. 56 Rev. 27; ZIMMERN,
      KL. 12 Rev. 17.

   54 This compound verb _di-e-sud_ here for the first time. _di-e_ is
      probably connected with _de_ to flee. At the end _AŠ_ is written for
      _AN_. Read _a-áš_ and construe _šeš_ as a plural?

_   55 gul_ = _kalû_, restrain, is ordinarily construed with the
      infinitive alone; _še-du nu-uš-gul-e-en_ = _damāma ul ikalla_, Lang.
      B.L. 80, 25; SBH. 133, 65; 66, 15, etc.

   56 Confirms SAI. 6507 = _uḳḳu_, dumb, grief stricken.

   57 Variant of _sīg-sīg_, etc. See _Sum. Gr._ p. 237 _sig._ 3. Also
      POEBEL, PBS. V 26, 29.

   58 On the liturgical use of _balag-di_, see BL. p. XXXVII.

   59 Var. of _ad-du-ge_ = _bêl nissāti_, IV R. 11_a_ 23: _ad-da-ge_, ZIM.
      K.L. 12 II 3. See for discussion, LANG. PBS. X 137 n. 7.

   60 A new ideogram. Perhaps _uššu kînu_, “sure foundation.”

   61 For suffixed _ni_, _bi_, _ba_ in interrogative sentences note also
      _a-na an-na-ab-duģ-ni_, What can I add to thee? GENOUILLAC,
      _Drehem_, No. 1, 12, _a-ba ku-ul-la-ba_, Who shall restrain? Ni.
      4610 Rev. 1.

   62 See BL. p. XLV, and PBS. X 151 note 1.

   63 On the anticipative construct, see § 138 of the grammar.

_   64 nu-mal_ are uncertain. The tablet is worn at this point.

   65 On the use of this term, see PBS. X 151 n. 1 and 182, 33.

   66 Cf. BL. 110, 11.

   67 Written Br. 3046, but the usual form is the _gunu_, Br. 3009.
      _suģ-ám-bi_ = _aḫulap-šu_. POEBEL, PBS. V 152 IX 8: cf. also lines 9
      and 10 _ibid._ In later texts _suģ-a_ = _aḫulap_, HAUPT, ASKT. 122,
      12. DELITZSCH, H. W. 44_a_. _aḫulap_ has the derived meaning of
      mercy, the answer to the “How long” refrain as in this passage. See
      also SBP. 241 note 27 and SCHRANK, LSS. III 1, 53.

   68 Cf. _nar-balag nig-dug-ga_, POEBEL, PBS. V 25 IV 48. Our text has
      the _emesal_ form _ag-zib_.

   69 For _dû-na_ = _šalṭiš_, see RA. 11, 146, 33.

   70 Written Br. 3046 = _nasāḳu_.

   71 For _ta-šú_. Cf. BA. V 679, 14.

   72 Probably a variant of _namģalam_, _namģilim_ = _šaḫluḳtu._

   73 The demonstrative pronoun _ģur_, _ūr_

_   74 mûši ù urra_, IV R. 5_a_ 65; CT. 16, 20, 68.

   75 Text _A-AŠ_.

   76 Sign _AL_. _šitim_, _šidim_ = _idinnu_ is usually written with the
      sign _GIM_, POEBEL, PBS. V 117, 14 f. _amelu ĢIM_ = _idinnu_, passim
      in Neo-Babylonian contracts.

   77 Literally, “caused to enter.”

_   78 munga_ with _ra_, to carry away property as booty, see SBH. No. 32
      Rev. 21 and BL. No. 51. The comparison with line 11 suggests,
      however, another interpretation, _immer-e be-in-ne-ra-ám_, “the
      storm-wind carried away.”

   79 In lines 7 and 9 the verb _tur_ is employed in the sense of “to
      cause an event to enter,” to bring about the entrance of a condition
      or state of affairs.

   80 Br. 11208.

   81 The passage refers to the priests’ robes and garments of the temple
      service. See also SBP. 4, 9.

   82 Variant of _nam-rig-aga_ = _šalālu_.

   83 See Obv. II 23.

   84 Enlil.

   85 Rendered _ša ṣirḫi_, BL. 95, 19. On this title for a psalmist, see
      BL. XXIV.

_   86 uš_ has evidently some meaning similar to the one given in the
      translation but it has not yet been found in this sense in any other
      passage. We have here the variant of _iš_, _eš_ = _bakû_ with vowel
      _u_. See _Sum. Gr._ 213 and 222.

_   87 DUL-DU_. The sign _DUL_ is erroneously written REC. 236. In the
      text change _si_ to _ši_.

   88 Br. 3739.

   89 Here treated as plural.

   90 The tablet has _SU_. For _šag-zu_ synonym of _teṣlitu_, see IV R.
      21b Rev. 5.

_   91 libbu rûḳu_; see ZIMMERN, KL. No. 8 I 3 and IV 28.

   92 The sign like many others on this tablet is imperfectly made.
      _ma-pad_? or _ma-šig_? The meaning is obscure.

   93 Text uncertain. Perhaps _PI-SI-gà-bi_.

   94 Written _A-KA_. An unpublished Berlin syllabar gives _A-KA (uga)_ =
      _muḫḫu_.

   95 Br. 5515. For this sign with value _maštaku_, see DELITZSCH, H. W.,
      _sub voce_ and BA., V 620, 20. The Sumerian value is _ama_, Chicago
      Syllabar, 241 in AJSL. 33, 182.

   96 Restored from an unpublished text in Constantinople, Ni. 721.

   97 Section 4 ended somewhere in this break.

   98 Probably a refrain.

   99 For the reading, see AJSL. 33, 182, 240.

  100 See BL. 128, 21.

  101 Read _A-AN_, i. e., _ám_.

  102 Cf. _sag-bi zi-zi_, ZIMMERN, K.L. 199 I 36.

  103 Cf. LANG. _Sumerian Liturgical Texts_ 154, 16.

_  104 AR_ is written _ŠI+ḪU_!

  105 The second sign _gí_ is only partially made by the scribe.

  106 The analysis of the text and the meaning are difficult. Perhaps _a_
      should be taken with the following sign _a-ḪAR-ri_, an unknown
      ideogram. _mur-ri_ is here taken for _rigmu_.

  107 See line 12 above.

  108 Sic! Demonstrative pronoun. See _Sum. Gr._ § 163.

  109 Here we have the first occurrence of the original expression for
      _kullu ša rêši_; cf. BR. 11244.

  110 Cf. SBP. 330, 10.

  111 The epithet refers to Išme-Dagan.

  112 This word is obscure and unknown.

  113 On _gigunna_, part of the stage tower, see VAB. IV 237 n. 2; BL. 38,
      14.

  114 Cf. SBP. 328, 5.

  115 Written Br. 3046. See Br. 3035.

  116 Br. 11208.

_  117 me_ = _parṣu_, refers primarily to the rubrics of the rituals, the
      ritualistic directions, but here the reference is clearly to the
      utensils employed in the rituals.

_  118 NE-RU._

_  119 lal, lá-a_ = _šuḳammumu_, see SBP. 66, 20.

_  120 ir_ is uncertain. The sign may be either _dū_ or _ni_.

  121 Literally, “Below and above.”

  122 Probably a variant of _dù-azag_. As the phrase is written
      _dug-azag-ga_ might mean “holy knees,” _birku ellitu_, but that is
      not probable. A parallel passage occurs in the liturgy to Dungi, BE.
      31, 12, 8, where my interpretation is to be corrected. For _dù_,
      _dŭ_, rendered into Semitic by the loan-word _dû_, with the sense
      “high altar, pedestal of a statue, altar or throne room” see AJSL.
      32, 107.

  123 Cf. Gudea, Cyl. B 13, 4.

  124 This phrase should have a meaning similar to “speak words of peace,”
      “assure, comfort.” The expression occurs also in Gudea, Cyl. A 7, 5,
      Ningirsu, son of Enlil _gú za-ra ma-ra-ģun-gà-e_, “will speak to
      thee words of peace.”

_  125 kuš_, preposition = _eli_, is derived from _kuš_ = _zumru_, “body,”
      literally “at the body.”

  126 In view of the parallel passages where kings are called the _sag-uš_
      of temples and cities (i. e. the _mukînu_ or _mukîl rêš_) it seems
      necessary to render _é-kur-ri_ as the object of _sag-uš_. See SAK.
      197 below c 5; BE. 29 No. 1 IV 6; PBS. V No. 73. A rendering, “She
      who raiseth me up daily in Ekur” is possible.

  127 Cf. SBP. 52, 5; BL. p. 138.

  128 Sic! third person.

  129 Text “his.”

  130 Or read _billudu_. This passage proves that _garza_ and _billudu_
      really do have a meaning, sanctuary, cult object or something
      synonymous. See _billudû_ in VAB. IV Index. The meaning, sanctuary,
      has been suggested for the Semitic _parṣu_ and this must be taken
      into consideration.

  131 Var. _šar-ra_.

  132 Var. is certainly not _nin_.

  133 For _sag-sìr_, see also ASKT. 96, 25; K. L., 199, 15; 199 Col. III
      51; CT. 24, 15, 79.

  134 Var. _mu-e_.

  135 Same as previous footnote.

  136 Cf. Ni. 4581 Obv. 8 in PBS. X pt. 2, where it is connected with
      _d.__Immer_. Var. _KA-gí-a!_

  137 Read _ḪU_ for _RI_(?). _mušen_ = _bêlu_, _beltu_, cf. PBS. V 15 Rev.
      14. Render “Their divine queen thou art”?

  138 Var. _ni_. Sic!

  139 Var. _ma_.

_  140 ḫāmimat kiššati_.

  141 Sic! Prepositions _ra_ and _da_ in the same phrase!

  142 Text _gĭr_!

  143 Cf. _mar-zen_, _gar-zen_ = _ḫâšu_, SBP. 116, 33; K.L., 15 II 12.

  144 In liturgies usually translated by “the Word.”

  145 Cf. SBP. 6, 16.

  146 For _ra_. Read _za-la_ for _lal-la_?

  147 Note the overhanging vowel _a_ denoting a dependent phrase without a
      relative introductory adverb, and see also _Sum. Gr._ page 163,
      examples cited _bé-in-da-ra-dú-a_, etc.

  148 The plural of this verb has been indicated by doubling the root, a
      case of analogy, being influenced by the similar plural formation of
      nouns. See _Sum. Gr._ § 124. An example of the same kind is
      _sag-nu-mu-un-da-ab-gà-gà_ = _ul ì-ir-ru-šu_, “they approached it
      not,” K. 8531, 6 in HROZNY, _Ninrag_, p. 8.

  149 Text _ub!_ Read _ub sag-ki-za_ = _tupḳi pani-ki_(??).

  150 For the form, see PBS. V 102 IV 3.

  151 If _la_ be correct, then the reading is _ka-sil-la_.

  152 Cf. _nir-da-an_, K. 45, 6, and _nir-da_, Gudea, Cyl. A 12, 26 with
      18, 3 where _nig-erim_ = _nir-da_.

  153 For _i-lu-dúg_ = _ṣarāḫu_.

_  154 a-a_ = _è-a_ = _aṣû_. CT. 15, 11, 7; K. L. 3_b_ 28. Cf. also the N.
      Pr. _d.__Gišbar-a_ = _d.__Gišbar-è_. “The fire-god causes to come
      forth.”

  155 So the text for _šág-ga-áš na-an-da-ab-bi_.

  156 See above, line 36.

  157 For the construction _dirig_ with _ra_, see _lù-ne-ir dirig_ = _eli
      annim rabi_, POEBEL, PBS V 152 32.

  158 See previous footnote.

  159 Refers to Sin.

  160 Here begins abruptly a passage spoken by the goddess herself. This
      is not unusual in liturgical texts.

  161 The sign is _dù_, not _dul_.

  162 For a discussion of these early Sumerian single song services, see
      the writer’s _Babylonian Liturgies_, pp. XXXVII ff.

  163 See also line 13.

  164 See _Tammuz and Ishtar_, p. 111.

  165 The Sumerian _arâ-bu_ (_UD-DU-BU_) is rendered into Semitic by the
      loan-word _arabû_, called _iṣṣur mēḫu_, bird of the storm, ZA. VI
      244, 48. In CT. XII 7_a_ 2 _UD-DU_ (_ara_) = _namru_, fierce,
      raging, where the entry is followed by _UD-DU_ (_ara_) = _ša
      UD-DU-bu_ (_ģu_), hence in any case a bird of prey. Were it not for
      the reference to this bird in the omen text, BOISSIER, DA 67, 18,
      one might conclude that the bird is mythical. For the reading
      _arabû_, see also REISNER, SBH. 104, 35.

  166 = _ḳadādu ša kišadi_, see SBP. 110, 22, “bend the neck,” i. e.,
      “grant favor.”

  167 Cf. V Raw. 39_a_ 33.

  168 Cf. _dagan-me-a_ = _ina puḫri-ni_, RA. XI 144, 8.

  169 Cf. SBP. 45, 13; 79, 13; 98, 44, etc.

  170 For this method of forming the plural see _Sumerian Grammar_, § 124.
      For _uru-bar_ = _kapru_, see MEISSNER, SAI. 543. Note also _umun
      urú-bar_, SBH. 22, 57 = 19, 56 and K. 69 Obv. 20. title of Nergal as
      lord of the city of the dead.

  171 Cf. _Historical and Religious Texts_, p. 34, 6.

  172 For Ninlil as queen of Keš, see also ZIMMERN, KL. 23 3; SBP. 23 note
      17. At Keš she was identified with the unmarried and earlier deity
      Ninharsag.

  173 The line drawn across the tablet intersects the address of Innini
      and, if not for some unknown musical purpose, must be regarded as an
      error.

  174 For the construction, see _Sumerian Grammar_, § 91.

_  175 GA_ = _našû_, variant of _ga (ILA)_ = _našû_. The figure of lifting
      the foot and raising the hand (line 30) to Enlil refers to the
      attitude of adoration assumed by the mother goddess as she stands
      before one of the gods and intercedes for mankind. She is frequently
      depicted on seals in this attitude; see for example WARD, _Seal
      Cylinders of Western Asia_, 303_a_, 304, 308, etc.

  176 The suffixed pronoun _mu_ with affixed preposition _ra_.

  177 Innini is compared to the _sudin_-bird in SBP. 6, 16 also.

  178 For the optative use of this vowel, see _Sumerian Grammar_, § 217.

  179 Dialectic for _du_ = _da_ = _ga_ (by vowel harmony). Note the form
      _ga-mu-ra-ab-šid_ with variant _da-mu-ra-ab-šid_, _Sumerian
      Liturgical Texts_, 155, 30 (variant unpublished). See also _Sumerian
      Grammar_, § 50.

  180 For the idea, see also SBP. 292, 25-29.

  181 For _ŠURIM_ with value _uz=laḇru_, see THOMPSON, _Reports_ 103, 11
      and supply _u-uz_ in CT. 12, 26_a_ 22.

  182 The sign for _enzu_ certainly has a phonetic value ending in _d_;
      note NIKOLSKI NO. 262, where the sign is followed by _da_ and
      ZIMMERN, _Kultlieder_, 123 III 9, where it is followed by _dé_.

  183 See lines 3, 23, 31 and 44 below and lines 5, 14, 21, 27 and 34 of
      the parallel text in the volume cited above.

  184 This refrain occurs also in _Sumerian Liturgical Texts_, 121, 5;
      122, 14, 17; 123, 21, 27, 34, where it characterizes a lamentation
      for various cities of Sumer destroyed by an invasion from Gutium.
      The translation given above is preferable to the interpretation
      accepted in my previous volume.

  185 Title of Sin in CT. 25, 42, 5. Note also that _dumugu_ is a title of
      Sin, II Raw. 48, 33, and CT. 24, 30, 5.

  186 For _namga_ as an emphatic adverb, see _Journal of the Society of
      Oriental Research_, I 20, Metropolitan Syllabar, Obv. I 12-15.

  187 The scribe has written _im_ twice.

  188 Cf. SBP. 4, 6.

_  189 gar_ is employed as a variant of _kar_, see _Sum. Gr._ 223. For
      _gar_ in this sense, note _gar_ = _šaḫātu_, _nasāḫu_ in the
      syllabars. See also SBP. 198, 14 and note 15. The same sense of
      _gar_ will be found in Gudea, Cyl. A 6, 16; 7, 14; St. B 9, 16; Cyl.
      A 12, 25.

  190 The third sign of this ideogram is clearly _UNU_ not _NINA_ on the
      tablet. For the ideogram see SBP. 284, 6.

  191 For the adverbial force of _bi_ see _Sum. Gr._ § 72.

  192 Restored from _Sumerian Liturgical Texts_, 123 31, and below line
      45.

_  193 KA_ with value _du_ = _alāku_ occurs here for the first time.
      Variant has _du_ (line 33). This text supplies two more signs and
      makes possible a better translation.

  194 Cf. _Babylonian Liturgies_, No. 78, 3.

  195 Cf. PBS. XII No. 6 Obv. 11.

  196 Identification uncertain.

  197 The line is parallel to PBS. X 122, 13.

_  198 nam-en-na_ = _enûtu_, priesthood.

  199 A title of Nergal.

  200 About four lines are broken away to the end of the tablet.

_  201 igi-da_ occurs also in the title of Sin, _igi-da-gál_, ZIMMERN,
      KL., No. 1 Obv. I 3 and 6. The most natural interpretation is to
      regard _da_ as a variant of _du_, hence “to go before.”

  202 Written _túg_. _gu-šig_ is a kind of plant, on a tablet of the Tello
      Collection in Constantinople, MIO. 7086. For the meal of the
      _gu-šig_ see also CT. X 20, II 33 and REISNER, _Templeurkunden_, 128
      Col. III.

  203 Restored from line 14. Here begins the rehearsal of the woes of
      Erech.

  204 Cf. also CT. 15, 19 Rev. 2 where a place word is also expected.

  205 Cf. Gudea, St. B 9, 27.

  206 Semitic _šattamma_ a title employed in later times apparently in a
      secular sense. Originally it has a sacred meaning and probably
      denoted a musical director who was also a priest. The application of
      a priestly title to the king is in accord with his royal
      prerogatives.

  207 The sign is Br. 8899.

  208 For _ni_ = _nu_, see SBP. 138, 22, _ni-kuš-ù_ = _nu-kuš-ù_; SBH. 70,
      3 = 131, 48. Read _li_?

  209 Text _GAR!_

_  210 BAD_ = _kidinu_, has the value _uš_; cf. _uš-sa_ = _kuddinu_, Br.
      5061.

_  211 e_ is here interpreted as a phonetic variant of _UD-DU_. Cf. also
      _e-dam_ in SBP. 118, 39.

  212 This is the first example of this form employed as subject.

  213 The text is difficult. _UN_ is certain but the sign _SAL_ is not
      clear on the tablet.

  214 Text _SU_.

  215 Phonetic variant of _gil-sa_ = _sukuttu_. The prefix _a_ is
      difficult and probably the noun augment, see _Sum. Gr._ § 148. The
      vowel _a_ seems to possess another sense in SBP. 284, 1.

_  216 gí_ = _piḫû_, confine, RA. 9, 77 I, 10; note also _é-a-ám gí_ =
      _ina bîti piḫû_, K. 41 Col. II 12.

  217 Part of the door; see VAB. IV Index.

  218 Variant of _á-taģ_ = _rêṣu_. The final _ka_ is for the emphatic _ge_
      in the status obliquus (_ga_). This emphatic particle is here
      attached to the object which is not a construct formation, but the
      choice of _ka_ for _ge_ is probably influenced by the principle of
      employing the oblique case of the construct when the noun in
      question is in the accusative; see _Sum. Gr._ § 135. “Defender”
      refers to Tammuz.

  219 The same title in PBS. V 2 Obv. II 23, _d__Dumu-zi šu-PEŠ_. POEBEL
      interpreted this as a variant of _šu-ģa_ = _ba’iru_, fisherman, and
      his suggestion is probably correct. We have, however, to consider
      the possibility of a confusion with _kam_ = _ukkušu_, the afflicted,
      SAI. 5082.

  220 The rise of the semi-vowel _i_ between the vowels _a-a_ occurs under
      similar circumstances in _igi-ģe-ni-ib-ila-ia-dúg_, RADAU,
      _Miscellaneous Texts_, No. 4, 5. See also _Sum. Gr._ § 38, 2. The
      form above arose from _bar-ri-a-a-dúg_. The prefixed element _dúg_
      falls under § 153 of the Grammar. _bar_ = _sapāḫu_ is a variant
      _par_, to spread out, scatter.

_  221 šub_, to let fall, _hence tabāku_, to pour out. Heretofore this
      meaning of _šub_ was known only from the forms _al-šù-šù-be_ =
      _ittanatbak_, SBH. No. 62, 15, and forms cited by MEISSNER, SAI.
      8345. See also _šu from šub_, _ibid._, 8334 and _al-šù-šù-be_, MVAG,
      1913 pt. 2 p. 49, 16.

  222 The same passage occurs in Ni. 13856 II 13. _sîg-sîg_ = _šaḳummatu_,
      variant of _sīg-sīg_.

_  223 zig_ is probably phonetic for _šeg_ = _magāru_, see _Sum. Gr._ 258,
      _zig__7_.

_  224 lu_ from _lum_ = _dašû_, _dišû_, passim.

  225 Cf. also PBS. V 25 I 15; II 13 _mu-na-ni-ib-gí-gí_.

_  226 eku_ from _uku_ by dissimilation of vowels. See also REISNER, SBH.
      77, 17.

  227 For _ama_ = _ummatu_, _ummanātu_, see _Sum. Gr._ 202, _ama_2 and
      WEIDNER, _Handbuch der Babylonischen Astronomie_, p. 86, 4.

  228 See, for the musical instrument _AL_, _Sumerian Liturgical Texts_,
      Index, p. 221.

  229 Text omits _zu_, which is not on the tablet.

  230 Written _KU-KI_ Cf. also CT. 16, 44, 80 _KU-KI-gar-ra-bi_ = _ ina
      ašābi-šu_.

  231 Enlil.

  232 A reading _ár-im-me_, “it is glorified,” suggests itself. Cf. SBH.
      93, 1.

  233 Cf. TSA. 31 Obv. II.

  234 See PBS. Vol. XII 12.

  235 Cf. SBP. 295, 17.

_  236 ul-ti_ = _ḫubuṣu_, “the lusty man,” POEBEL, PBS. V 136 V 13, with
      which compare n. pra. _Ḫubbuṣu_, _Ḫubbuṣtu_, in HOLMA, “Personal
      Names of the Form _fu ul_,” p. 50. Note also _ul-ti-a_ = _ḫābṣatum_,
      PBS. V _ibid._ l. 12. The hymn to Sin, SBP. 296, contains in line 14
      the same phrase.

  237 Text not entirely certain. If correctly read the signs _ḪAR-GUD_ =
      _kabattu_ must be read in SBP. 48, 45 after the variant SBH. 3, 10.

  238 Restored from line 10. The only previous occurrence of this name is
      in SMITH’S _Miscellaneous Texts_, 11, 1 which has _RI_ not _MU_. The
      end of the name is broken in BL. No, 27. Perhaps SMITH copied the
      sign wrongly.

  239 Pronounced _udugga_ = _ṣaltu_.

  240 The name as transliterated means _mudammiḳ musarrê_, “Temple of the
      benefactor of writing.” In line 15 its holy reed is mentioned, a
      mythical stylus symbolic of the god of wisdom, Enki, according to
      SAK. 6 h.

_  241 nar-balag_ = _tigû_, a kind of flute. Here the word indicates that
      in the musical accompaniment this instrument was employed. It
      probably denotes a specific kind of melody. Three other musical
      instruments have given their names to classes of melodies, the
      _eršemma_, _balag_ and _me-zí_, see SBP. page IX, and BL. page
      XXXVIII.

_  251 gim_, emphatic suffix.

  252 We meet here for the first time with two avenging angels or genii
      who attend the Word in its execution of the wrath of god.
      _Ḳingaludda_ is mentioned as one of four evil spirits _ilu limmu_ in
      CT. 25, 22, 44. He is mentioned with the Zû bird and the demon
      _šêdu_ as appearing in dream omens, BOISSIER, DA. 207, 34. See also
      BOISSIER, _Choix_, II 53, 4. On _uddugub_ as a title of kings see
      BE. 31, 22 n. 9.

  253 The _ud-gal_ is regarded as plural = _ûmu rabûti_ and identified
      with the evil spirits of incantations, CT. 16, 22, 266 and 276. In
      the Epic of Creation the “great spirit of wrath” is one of the
      demons attendant upon Tiamat.

_  256 gĭr_? Variant _gú-nin!_

  257 Cf. RA. 12, 37, 1.

  258 So from my copy and CT. IV 4_b_ 12 = _Babyloniaca_, III 17.

  259 For this title of Tammuz, see _Tammuz and Ishtar_, 34.

  260 Probably for _dagan = puḫru_, RA. 11, 144, 8. See also _dakan_,
      divine abode, DELITZSCH, _Glossar_, 132.

  261 Cf. SB P. 304, 13.

  262 Title of Tammuz as spirit of the waters, see _Tammuz and Ishtar_,
      pp. 6 and 44. _a-bal = tābik mê_, pourer of water, irrigator, is the
      original idea of this ideogram. For the title _galu-a-bal_ in this
      sense, see CT. 13, 42, 7 ff. _Ak-ki galu abal_, the gardener who
      cared for Sargon. See also THUREAU-DANGIN, _Lettres et Contrats_,
      No. 174, 6-8, _galu a-bal_, a kind of laborer. The later usage of
      the word as libator of water for the souls of the dead, Semitic _näḳ
      mê_ is a strictly conventional development, see _Babyloniaca_, VI
      208.

_  263 al_ as synonym of _DE_ (in line 21) is probably a variant of _ilu =
      nagû_.

  264 Sign _DE_.

  265 This line is connected with the classical interlude _ma-a-bi
      ud-me-na-gim_ etc. discussed in SBP. 185 n. 10 and BL. XLIX.

  266 Below the double line the figure 38, i.e. 38 lines on the obverse.
      Thirteen lines have been broken from the top.

  269 On this title see BL. 143.

  270 Probably an error. Omitted in translation.

  271 On this line, see the commentary in _Sumerian Liturgical Texts_ 173
      note 3.

  272 Temple in Isin-Šuruppak. Šuruppak must have been a quarter of the
      later and more famous Isin. Note that this temple is assigned to
      Šuruppak in POEBEL, PBS. V 157, 7. The liturgies, however,
      constantly place Niginmar at Isin.

  273 I see traces of a sign after _te_.

  274 Temple in Larak, a quarter of Isin. See SBP. 160 n. 7.

_  275 azag-sug_ title of the deities of lustration Ašnan, Nidaba and
      Gibil.

  276 Rendered _bit šarru_, V Raw. 16, 52, probably a royal chapel or room
      in Ekur especially provided for the king. See also SBP. 292, 14; KL.
      25 I 11.

  277 Probably name of a sacred park at Isin. It contained a chapel,
      _é-tir-azag-ga_, KL. 25 I 12.

  278 For the restoration, cf. RA. 12, 34, 9.

  279 The edge has the figure 48 which indicates the number of lines on
      the reverse and left edge.

  280 See also the same idea in SBP. 312, 12 and KL. 25 II 41.

  281 Concerning the _titular litanies_, see PBS. X 156, 173, etc.

  282 Erroneously designated the fourth tablet of _ame baranara_ in SBP.

  283 Erroneously assigned to _ame baranara_ in SBP.

  284 The text of lines 1-25 is taken from _Tablet Virolleaud_, now
      _Collection Nies._ No 1315.

  285 SBP. 112 and 126 have _umun_, et passim.

  286 SBH. 42 has an inserted line between II. 1-2. See SBP. 112.

  287 Vars. _nag_.

  288 Uncertain. Apparently REC. 225. Elsewhere in this passage always
      _ṢAB_ which has been read _erin-na_ = _ummāni-šu_, BL. 111, 16.

  289 See _Yale Vocabulary_ 135.

  290 On this passage see PBS. X 170, 13 and Ni. 15204, 8 of this volume.

  291 Sic! Error for _ní-bi-dúb_.

  292 Omitted by the scribe. Line restored from Ni. 15204, 11.

  293 With line 19 the variant SBH. 42 lower fragment begins.

  294 Var. adds _ra_.

  295 The god Ea of Eridu is meant.

  296 Cf. Col. II 19. On this variant for _dumu-maģ_, see note in
      _Sumerian Liturgical Texts_ 163.

  297 Restored from Col. II 20.

  298 We expect the sign _EDIN_ (= _rĭ_) but the traces are clearly not
      those of _EDIN_.

  299 Col. II 23 _ab-su-di_. Here begins KL. No. 11, I, which joins
      directly on to _Tablet Virolleaud_.

  300 This refrain is read _ù-um_ etc. on the late variant, SBH. No. 21,
      Obv. lower fragment.

  301 Cf. SBP. 40, 33. Restoration uncertain. This line does not appear in
      SBH. 42 = SBP. 112 which has here insertions for Tašmetu and Nanā.

  302 For _-na-ta_?. The suffixed conjugation is frequently employed in
      interrogations; _me-na gí-gí-mu_, “When shall one restore it?,” BE.
      30, 12, 2. _a-ba ku-ul-la-ba_, “Who shall restrain?,” Ni. 4610, r.
      1. _a-na an-na-ab-taģ-ni_, “What shall I add to thee?,” GENOUILLAC,
      _Drehem_, 1, 12. Variant SBP. 114, 32 _zag-na ab-zí-em-e_.

  303 Var. SBH. 43, 35 _ur-ra-ge_.

  304 Parallel passages do not mention the “queen of the city” but only
      the ordinary mother who rejects her children, SBH. 131, 58-61; BL.
      74, 10. The phrase refers obviously to the mother goddess. “Her son”
      must be interpreted figuratively in the sense that the mother
      goddess is the protector of all human creatures.

  305 This title _gašan-sun_ or _nin-sun_, really means _beltu rimtu_,
      “the wild-cow queen,” and characterizes the ancient mother goddess
      as patroness of cattle. The title usually refers to the married type
      Gula or Bau, as in SBP. 284, 19, and note that Ninsun, mother of
      Gilgamish, is frequently called _ri-mat_, POEBEL, OLZ, 1914, 4. The
      title also applies to the virgin type Innini in KL. 123 r. II 7.

_  306 mu-lu imme_ also BE. 30, 9 I 2 = _bêl ḳûli_(?), “Man of wailing.”
      The late version replaces this line by _[te-e-ám] da-ga-a-ta
      dumu-ni_, “How long shall the wife of the strong man reject her
      son?”, SBP. 114, 37. _dagāta = dam-guṭu_, SBH. 131, 60.

  307 Probably a title of Ekur. _ešgalla_ title of the temple in Kullab,
      KL. 3 II 20. The late version rejects this line since its local
      reference was not suited to general use.

  308 Here this line begins an Enlil melody within the body of a series.
      Originally _a-gal-gal šel-su-su_ was a Nergal melody and a series
      based upon it is catalogued in IV R. 53_a_ 33 of which K. 69 is the
      first tablet. See also BÖLLENRÜCHER, _Nergal_, No. 6.

  309 The late redaction of this melody revises this litany with the new
      liturgical movement _ursaggal—elimma_ placed before alternate lines.
      When this scheme is employed all feminine deities are omitted. See
      SBP. 114. Note 5 p. 115 _ibid._ is to be suppressed.

  310 Lines 7-10 conjecturally restored from _Sumerian Liturgical Texts_
      165, 8-11.

  311 Lines 11-17 restored from SBP. 116, 16 ff.

  312 Meaning and restoration uncertain.

  313 First line on ZIMMERN, No. 11 Col. II.

  314 See note on line 27 above.

  315 Usually _pà_ = _ekû_, canal, is used in this title of Zarpanit. She
      is originally a patroness of irrigation and ultimately identical
      with Ninā.

_  316 ab-su_ = _ab-zu_, sea? Cf. _ab-zu-bil-la_, the shining ocean, KL. 1
      Rev. I 19 f.

  317 SBP. 116, 27 _dé-en-kùr-e_.

  318 Var. _u-mi-a_, SBP. 116, 33.

  319 Line 29 is false and to be corrected after the late text SBP. p.
      118, 35 f. which has two lines. Read _ki an dúr-ru-na-šú
      __d__A-nun-na [gar-ma-an-zí-en]_, where Anu sits let the Anunnaki
      hasten.

  320 Cf. SBH. 44, 37.

_  321 ilu ra’imu_.

_  322 napḫar māti_, cf. IV R. 23_b_ 15.

  323 It is not certain that this melody ended here. Possibly all the
      titles in lines 19-27 followed here with the refrain
      _am-ma-ab-túg-e_. At any rate the traces of a last line on SBH. 44
      are those of the last line of this melody. There is not space enough
      on SBH. 44 after line 37 for more than the lines 31-40 supplied
      above for we must make some allowance for the interlinear Semitic
      translations in the break on SBH. 44.

_  324 šubat pirišti._ This sanctuary at Nippur is mentioned in BE. 29 No.
      5 Obv. 11; _dù-sag_ in KL. 64 II 4 and III 6.

  329 Cf. SBP. 38, 13.

  330 Cf. _ibid._ 98, 48.

  331 In case the tablet possessed five columns like KL. 25 then this
      column is Rev. III. I know of no _four_ column tablets of similar
      kind.

_  332 sag_ began a refrain which followed the titles of Enlil, Ea, etc.
      and ended with this line. See Obv. I 21-31, etc.

  333 Cf. SBP. 82, 47.

  334 A title of Egalmah in Isin, SBH. 94, 29 = SBP. 186, 29.

  335 Either DAM or _SAL + KU_ (sister) must be expected, since we have
      obviously a reference to Aruru here.

  336 Sic! An error for _en-ne_? See SBP. 120, 1. Perhaps _dé_ = _te_,
      “where?” strengthened by _en_ = _adi_.

  337 The following melody has been restored from the late variant SBP. p.
      120.

  338 Glossed _gú-da_.

  339 Semitic _lu-uk-mi-is-su_, glossed _kamû_. _kamû_, “to bind,” is the
      natural rendering of _lal_. The Semitic should perhaps be neglected
      as faulty and the Sumerian rendered, “Like a wild ox by the mighty
      one I am hobbled.”

  340 Lines 21-26 may not have stood in the ancient liturgy.

  341 Here begins variant 81-7-27, 203 = BA. X 87.

  342 Nippur.

  343 Beginning of a melody of a weeping mother series, BL. p. 94, 12. It
      is not certain that this melody stood in the ancient text. See for
      the text 81-7-28, 203 (= 78239) in this volume.

  344 Cf. SBH. 132, 27.

  345 The duplicate, MEEK, NO. 11, has here another melody not a titular
      litany. This text does not belong to the _e-lum gud-sun_ series.

  346 This title of Uraša remains unexplained. In all other examples
      _d__Uraša ki-še-gu-nu-ra_, SBP. 150, 6; 90, 20; K. 3931 Rev. 29; KL.
      17 Rev. II 6. Perhaps also Gudea, Cyl. B 19, 13 is to be restored
      _ki-še-gu-[nu-ra]_.

  350 Usually _me-šár-ra_. Enlil name, CT. 24, 4, 26. Not originally
      associated with Nergal. See _Historical and Religious Texts_, p. 35.

  351 Here both titles of Ninlil. Variant _nin-zíd-an-na_, PSBA. 1911, 233
      n. 39.

  352 See previous footnote.

  353 Originally title of Enlil, CT. 24, 25, 97 = 13, 42. Usually Marduk
      as Jupiter.

  354 Two other readings of this title of Ninlil as mother goddess are
      known; _d__Še-en-tūr_, SBP. 150 n. 5, l. 11 and _d__Še-en-tur_,
      KING, _Supplement_ to BEZOLD’S _Catalogue_, p. 10, No. 51, 8 where
      she is identified with Nintud = _d__bêlit_.

      _Textes Elamites-Semitiques_, p. 4 and in name of ancient patesi of
      Umma, _Ur-lum-ma_, see THUREAU-DANGIN, SAK. 273. SCHEIL, I. c. 4,
      says that _Lum_, _Ḫum_ is an Elamitic god. The title _gašan-dig-ga_
      indicates a female deity. Note the variant _gašan-sa-lum-ma_, SBP.

      deity as _d__Nin-né_ = _Almu_, form of Nergal in V Raw. 21, 25. For
      _Nin-né_ in the early period see ALLOTTE DE LA FUŸE, DP. 128 II 3.

  400 All father-mother names of Enlil, CT. 34, 3, 29 ff.

  401 This Semitic rubric is unique in the published literature of
      Sumerian liturgies. It indicates that the choristers should here
      complete the long titular litany by reciting the titles of the
      deities named in the litany given in full on the Berlin tablet; see
      the preceding edition of K. L. 11 Rev. IV 1 ff.

  402 For this rubric, see PBS. X 151 note 1.

  403 For Enlil connected with the idea of light, see PBS. X 158 n. 1.

  404 The pronoun refers apparently to _uru_ in line 15.

      140.

  410 For the interpretation, see RA. 12, 27 n. 5.

  411 See for readings BL. 38, 9.

  412 See also _Tablet Virolleaud_, Rev. end.

  413 Also Opis was sometimes called Keš, see CT. 16, 36, 3, _ki-e-ši_,
      gloss on the ideogram for Opis.

  414 For Ninharsag at Keš, see also SAK. 14 XVIII 6. Another title of the
      goddess at Keš is Ninmah, SAK. 237e.

  415 Here the god of Opis is given as Igidu, a form of Nergal. In this
      late text Opis on the Tigris at Seleucia is probably intended. The
      southern Keš and Opis were imitated in Akkad, at any rate in later
      times, and Keš was apparently confused with Kiš which gave rise to a
      second Kiš in Akkad. The ancient and historical Kiš at Oheimer on
      the canal of the Euphrates should not be confused with Kiš
      corruption for the new Keš near Seleucia.

  416 The god _Igi-du_ of Keš is identified with Ninurta as were most of
      the male satellites of the mother goddesses in various cities. CT.
      25, 24 K. 8219, 17+K. 7620, 18, _d__Igi-du_ = _d__Nin-urta_.
      According to CT. 25, 12, 17 it is one of the titles of Ninurta in
      Elam. But in CT. 24, 36, 52 _d__Igi-du_ is a form of Nergal, and in
      the omen text, BOISSIER, DA. 238, 10 he is explained as
      _d._Meslamtaèa, a form of Nergal.

  417 Or perhaps Negun. See below.

  418 BL. 72, 14. Here Keš or Kisa is written with the ideogram for Opis.

  420 SAK. 118 XXVII 2.

  421 A temple _é-an-za-kar_ is assigned to Opis in POEBEL, PBS. V 157, 8
      and ZIMMERN, KL. 199 Rev. I 37 (here without _é_). This temple can
      hardly be the one which forms the subject of the liturgy on the
      Ashmolean Prism.

  422 Published by BARTON, _Miscellaneous Religious Texts_.

  423 A new copy of the Ashmolean Prism is published in the _Revue
      d’Assyriologie_, Vol. XVI.

  424 Cf. BA. V 707, 7.

  425 Probably for _gud-NINDA=bîru, mîru_.

  426 Var. _na_.

  427 Some verb seems to be missing here. The construction is obscure.

  428 So the prism.

  429 Var. _ni_.

  430 Variant Constple. omits _ki_.

  431 Cf. _ki-gim rib-ba_ = _kima irṣitim šûtuḳat_, DELITZSCH, AL3 134, 5.
      _KAL_ (_ri-ib_) = _šûtuḳu_, Chicago Syllabar 287; _rib_ = _šutuḳḳu_,
      CT. 19, 11, 12; _nam-kalag-ga-ni rib-ba_ = _dannussu šûtuḳat_, IV
      Raw. 24_a_ 48; _ana-gim ki-gim rib-ba-zu-ne_ = _ša kima šamê u
      irṣitim šûtugata_, SBP. 250, 6. See also EBELING, KTA. 32, 5,
      _rib-ba_ = _šu-tu-ḳu_.

  432 The meaning is obscure. For the suggested rendering cf. _en me-a
      túm-ma_, the lord who cares for the decrees, SAK. 204, 6.

  433 For this emphatic verbal prefix cf. DELITZSCH, AL3, 134, 5; ZIMMERN,
      KL. 68 Rev. 24.

  434 I. e. Nintud. For _ummu_ in the sense of “mother goddess” note CT.
      16, 36, 1-9 where the various mothers of Eridu, Kullab, Keš, Lagash
      and Šuruppak are invoked. The reference here is undoubtedly to
      Ninlil as the mother of Negun, SBP. 156, 39.

_  435 a-ba_ = _arka_, and then. The same phrase in BE. 31, 2, 7 and for
      _aba_, see especially _Sum. Gr._ § 241. _er-du(ģ)_ probably variant
      of _er-du_ = _damāmu_.

  436 Ni. 14031 in PBS. X No. 22 has as the verb the sign _dug_ written
      five times, as also the prism.

  437 Restored from the variant Cstple. Rev. I 10.

  438 So? _kur = napāḫu_, better than my former rendering of this passage.

_  439 idim_ = _šegû, nadāru_ (cf. THOMPSON, _Reports_ 82, 6 with 108, 5),
      refers to the rumbling of the great gates of the temple.

  440 Br. 2729? Cf. R _(si-gi) = ḳaḳḳabu_, CT. 18, 49, 4.

  441 Same phrase in CLAY, _Miscel_. 31, 33.

_  442 ni_ = _nu_; cf. SBP. 138, 22, _ni-kuš-ù_; POEBEL, PBS. V 26, 10.

  443 So on Var. Cstple. II 6.

  444 First example of the verb _zu_ strengthened by augment _a_; cf.
      _a-ru_, _a-sil_ in _Babyloniaca_ II 96.

  448 Read _ge-ne_? Ni. 8384 _ge_(?)_-e-ne_.

  449 Ni. 8384 _dam_.

  450 So on 8384.

  451 Var. Cstple. _é_. See below line 21 and BL. 88 n. 4.

  452 Fifth section on Ni. 8384.

  453 First sign on Ni. 8384 Rev. 1.

  454 Ni. 8384 _gí_

  455 Same sign on Var. Cstple. But Ni. 8384 has a sign apparently related
      to the difficult sign which I assimilated to Br. 4930 in AJSL. 33,
      48. The sign on Ni. 8384 recurs in ZIMMERN, KL. 35 II 5.

  456 Var. Ni. 8384 _gal-e_; Var. Cstple. _gal-la_. According to CT. 24,
      10, 8 the throne bearer of Enlil, but in 24, 26, 124 a _ligir-gal_
      in the attendance of the mother goddess.

  457 Ni. 8384 _edin-na_; Var. Cstple. _edin_.

  458 Both variants add _e_.

  459 Var. of _gú-gar_ = _puḫḫuru_. See BL. 10, 30.

  460 Vars. omit _gim_.

  461 Ni. 8384 omits _ra_.

  462 Sixth on Ni. 8384.

  463 Lines 29-IV 4 are partially restored from Ni. 14031.

  464 First signs on RADAU, _Miscel_. No. 8 = Ni. 11876.

  465 So Ni. 11876.

  466 So apparently Ni. 11876.

  467 Text certain. Not _NUN_.

  468 See last footnote.

  469 Var. Cstple. _en_.

  470 Radau’s copy has _ḲIN_.

  471 Var. _a-an_.

  472 Ni. 11876 has _làl-e ki-azag-ga nam-mi-in-KU_?

  473 Ni. 11876 omits _e_. This text proves that in the ideogram Br. 1202
      the gloss _isimu_ belongs properly to the first two signs only and
      that the original reading was _isimu-abkal_. See especially CT. 12,
      16, 34 (_i-si-mu_) = _PAP-sîg_ = _usmû_. In the later period _abkal_
      was apparently not pronounced and the whole ideogram was rendered by
      _isimu_.

  474 This line is not on the prism.

  475 Ni. 11876 _ga-a-an_. Cstple. Var. _gig_ simply.

  476 Or _gú_.

  477 I edited this tablet in SBP. 120-123 where I erroneously assigned it
      to the Enlil series _ame baranara_. The tablet has been partially
      restored from MEEK, No. 11. The first two melodies of _elume didara_
      are used in the Enlil liturgy _elum gudsun_ near the end just before
      the titular litany and have been re-edited above pp. 300-2 in the
      edition of the _elum gudsun_ series.

  478 MEEK, No. 11 in BA. X pt. 1.

  479 SBP. 296.

  480 SBP. 236.

  481 SBP. 140.

  482 SBP. 226=SBH. No. 18.

  483 The first line, together with its Semitic translation, is identical
      with the first line of the third tablet of the series _muten
      nu-nunuz-gim_, see SBP. 140. Otherwise the melodies differ.

  484 The refrain _ù-li-li_ apparently provides an incomplete sentence.

  485 Cf. SBH. No. 84, 13, there a title of the river goddess.

  486 Lines 10-13 form a duplicate of SBH. No. 25, Rev. 2-5 = SBP. 122.

_  487 si-mă_, literally _karnānu_, the horned, referring to the new-moon.
      The variant SBP. 296, 1 has _má-gúr_, the crescent boat. Undoubtedly
      _má-gúr_ should be rendered by _nannaru_ in this passage.

  488 See BL. p. 132.

  489 I. e. Sin himself is the author of Nippur’s sorrows.

  490 Glossed _ki_.

_  491 LAḪ_; transcription and interpretation uncertain.

  492 Hereby is established the reading _pa(g)-dà = mûdu, kapdu_. Probably
      a kind of augurer.

  493 Probably tautological writing for _lallaģ = itabbulu_, Voc. Hittite
      7509.

  494 Cf. the first melody of the Ninurta series _gū-ud nim kur-ra_; see
      SBP. 226; BL. No. 9 and SBH. 40.

  495 Similar passages have _é-šár-ra_ (SBP. 226, 8; SBH. 40, 8) chapel of
      Ninlil in Ekur (SBP. 221 n. 7).

  496 Temple of Ninurta in Nippur. A syllabary recently published by
      SCHEIL (RA. 14, 174 I. 7) explains the name by _bit gi-mir par-ṣi
      hammu_, Temple which executes the totality of decrees. Note,
      however, the epithet _é i-dé-ila_ = _bit niš înê_, House of the
      lifting of the eyes, SBP. 208, 11.

  497 In any case an epithet of the temple of _Urta_ in Dilbat,
      _Ibe-__ilu__Anum_. For this reading _I-be_ see vars. _I-bi_, Im-bi,
      BL. p. 134. The word _ibi_ is probably Sumerian for _igi_, and shows
      that the phonetic rendering _i-de_ is erroneous. The dialectic
      pronunciation of _igi_ was _ibe_ and despite the Semitic variant
      _imbi_ the name is apparently Sumerian _Ibe-Anu_, Temple of the eye
      of Anu. Here _šu-gúd_ is an epithet for Anu, i. e. the lofty.

  498 See also SBH. 132, 46; BL. No. 56 Rev. 31; CRAIG, RT. 20, 30. This
      text has a variant _a_ for _di_.

  499 Probably part of the great city Isin, see SBP. 160 n. 7.

  500 Probably variant of _é-dŭr = adurû, kapru_, village, city, POEBEL,
      PBS. V 106 IV 30; see also II Raw. 52, 61 f. Note the similar title
      of the city of Bau _uru-azag-ga_ in SAK. 274; BL. 147. Here the
      title refers to Isin not Lagash.

  501 Cf. CRAIG, RT. II 16, 18 _d__Ama-ŠU-ḪAL-BI-ta_.

  502 Cf. CT. 12, 3_a_ 29; _ina šar-tu la uštešir-šu u ina me-riš-tum la
      i-kal-li_, “By fraud he has not translated it and with wilful
      readings has he not published it.” For _šutešuru_, “to translate or
      edit a tablet,” see LEHMANN, _Shamash-shum-ukîn_, Taf. XXXIV 17
      _akkadû ana šutešuri_, “to translate into Akkadian.” On this
      difficult passage concerning the education of Ašurbanipal see
      _Sumerian Grammar_, p. 3 and corrections by UNGNAD in ZA. 31, 41.
      _ikalli_ probably for _ukallim_; note the variant _ušâbi = ušâpi_.

  503 Only in a loose sense. From Tammuz to Kislev is the period of death,
      from Kislev to Tammuz the period of revivification of nature. See on
      the meaning of this passage KUGLER, _Im Bannkreis Babels_ 62-5.

  504 Temple of Marduk in Babylon.

  505 Temple of Nebo in Barsippa.

_  506 maš-dū_=_muškênitu_.

_  507 šarahitum._

  508 See _Tammuz and Ishtar_, p. 151. Ašrat or the western Ashtoreth
      usually had the title _bêlit ṣêri_, “Lady of the plains” and was
      identified with the Babylonian Geštinanna and Nidaba. Hence
      _[Bêlit-]ṣêri_ is _dupšarrat irṣitm_, scribe of the lower world,
      K.B. VI 190,47; cf. IV R. 27 B 29.

  509 See lines 51-4 of this tablet. Nergal descends into the earth on the
      18th of Tammuz and remains until the 28th of Kislev.

_  510 ilat__Šarrat_.

  511 Here epitomized. It will be found transcribed and translated by
      ZIMMERN in his _Zum Babylonischen Neujahrfest_, p. 129.

_  512 MAŠ_. See below Col. II 15, gypsum is Ninurta, the god of war,
      primarily a god of light. Gypsum, Sum. _im-bar_, “radiant clay,”
      became symbolic of Ninurta because of its light transparent color.

  513 So, because gypsum, lime and pitch are smeared on the door of the
      house and the god of light (Ninurta) tramples upon the demon of
      darkness.

  514 Two inferior deities related to Nergal, god of the lower world.
      Their images placed at the enclosure of a house prevent the demons,
      ZIMMERN, Rt. 168, 21 f. The image of Lugalgirra designed on a wall
      prevents the devils, _ibid._ 166,12. He binds the evil ones, IV R.
      21* C III 26. The two are placed at the right and left of a door to
      forbid the devils to enter. Maklu VI 124.

  515 The great trinity: heaven, earth and sea.

  516 In any case a cult utensil on which a noise was made, CT. 16, 24,
      32.

  517 See the Chicago Syllabar 230 where she is identified with Nidaba.

  518 Cf. ZA. 16, 178, 27; BA. V 649, 3; _Shurpu_ VIII 10.

  519 So A. B. COOK, _Zeus_, 632. I would, however, entertain doubts
      concerning this explanation of silver as the emblem of the Asiatic
      Zeus and of Jupiter Dolichenus. The identification of this metal
      with the sky god in Babylonia and Kommagene surely reposes upon a
      more subtle idea. [For the explanation of silver = Anu and gold =
      Enlil, see p. 342.]

  520 The Sabeans, a pagan Aramaic sect of Mesopotamia at Harran, are said
      to have assigned a metal to each planet. Since a considerable part
      of their religion was derived from Babylonia we may consider this
      direct evidence for the Babylonian origin of the entire tradition.
      For an account of the metals assigned to the planets by the
      Babylonians, Persians, Greeks and Sabeans, see Bousset in _Archiv
      für Religionswissenschaft_ 1901, article on “Die Himmelreise der
      Seele.” The order of the planets, taken from the Byzantine list
      above, is based upon their relative distances from the sun.

  521 Restoration from Zim. Rt. 27.

  522 Conjectural restoration from ASKT. 96, 21. ZIMMERN, Rt. 27 I 3-4 has
      a longer description of _[Ninḫabursildu a-ḫa-lat [__d__ A-gub-ba

  523 This deity appears in incantations as the queen of the holy waters
      _bêlit egubbê_, IV R. 28*b 16; _Bab._ III 28, Sm. 491, 3. Although
      placed in the court of Enlil the earth god as sister of Enlil by the
      theologians, CT. 24, 11, 40 = 24, 52, where she is associated with a
      special deity of holy water, _d__A-gub-ba_, yet by function and
      character she belongs to the water cult of Eridu. Her symbol is the
      holy water jar (_duk_) _agubba_ and the deity _d__Agubba_ is _šu-luģ
      lăg-lăg-ga Erida-ge_, Purifying handwasher of Eridu, CT. 24, 11, 41
      = 24, 53. The river goddess _d__Iă_ is also _bêlit agubbê_, CT. 16,
      7, 255 where in l. 254 _Ninḫabursildu_ is _aḫat __d__A-[gub-ba]_,
      sister of _Agubba_, and the river goddess is mother of Enki, or Ea,
      god of the sea, CT. 24, 1, 25. The reading _ḫabur_ for _A-ḪA_ is
      most probable, and the cognate or dialectic form _ḫubur_ is a name
      for the mysterious sea that surrounds the world. See BL. 115 n. 2.
      The holy water over which she presides is taken from the _apsu_ or
      nether sea, which issues from springs, hence _egubbû_ is spring
      water, CT. 17, 5 III 1. The name, then, really means “Queen of the
      lower world river, she that walks (_du_) the streets (_sil_).” The
      Semitic scribe of CT. 25, 49, 6 renders the name in a loose way by
      _bêlit têlilti bêlit ālikat sulê [rapšāti]_, Queen of lustration,
      queen that walks the [wide] streets (of the lower world). For the
      title _bêlit têliltī_, see CT. 26, 42 I 14. For a parallel to the
      description of her walking the streets of inferno, cf. _d__
      Kal-šág-ga sil-dagal-la edin-na_, Lady of purity who (walks) the
      wide streets of the plain (of inferno), consort of Irragal, god of
      the lower world, SBP. 158, 59. A variant, KL. 16 III 8 has
      _sil-gig-edin-na_, the dark street, etc.

  524 Variant of _kân-tūr_, V Raw. 42, 39.

  525 In K. 165 Rev. 8 f. the tamarisk and date palm are said to be
      created in heaven (_giš an-na ù-tŭ_) and the same is said of them in
      Gudea, Cyl. B 4, 10, _giš-šinig giš-šeḳḳa_ (i. e. = _šig =
      gišimmaru_) _an ù-tud-da_. This plant appears frequently in magic
      rituals, IV R. 59_b_ 4 _iṣu__ bi-ni_ (Semitic), IV R. 16_b_ 31,
      _Shurpu_ IX 1-8, and also in medical texts. _bînu_ has been
      identified with Syriac _bînā_, tamarisk. If this identification be
      correct, a comparison with the Hebrew legend of the _manna_ (bread
      of heaven in Psalms 105,40), said to have been the exudation of the
      tamarisk, is possible.

  526 Semitic _uḳuru_, Aramaic _ḳêrā_, see MEISSNER, MVAG. 1913, 2 p. 40
      and BE. 31, 69 n. 2. Used both in medicine and magic.

  527 Passim in rituals and medicine. See BE. 31, 69, 27; 72, 29; KING,
      _Magic_ 11, 44; MEISSNER, SAI. 2805.

  528 In _Shurpu_ VIII 70 mentioned with _šalālu_. A magic ointment made
      of the _El_ and _maštakal_, CT. 34, 9, 41. See also EBELING, KTA. 90
      rev. 17; KING, _Magic_ 30, 25. Perhaps identical in name with the
      stone _arzallu_, SAI. 8545. On a Dublin tablet often _giš EL_. Cf.
      _ú-šig-el-šar_ = _šûmu_, onion.

  529 For the correct reading _ni-ná-a_, see AJSL. XXXIII 194, 159.

  530 Here a wood employed in magic, cf. BE. 31, 60, 6+15. In syllabars
      _giš-BUR = gišburru, giškirru_, indicates a weapon or an utensil.

_  531 NITA-DU_, fire god, title of Nergal as fire god and identical with
      _d__ gĭr_ = Nergal.

  532 Here certainly _Anu_, heaven god, followed by Earth and Sea gods.
      Note also _d__Gu-la_ in liturgies _passim_ as title of Anu, BL. 136.
      Anu = Sin, see p. 342.

  533 Title of Enlil, lord of the totality of decrees. Enlil = Šamaš.

  534 Originally title of the great unmarried mother goddess _bêlit
      ilāni_, but often a title of the virgin types Innini and Ninâ, BL.
      141; of Gula _ibid._ Also somewhat frequently she is Damkina,
      consort of Ea, IV R. 54_b_ 47; CT. 33, 3, 21 her star beside that of
      Ea. Here she is the mother goddess and the same order, Heaven,
      Earth, Sea, Mother Goddess in _Shurpu_ IV 42, where Nin-maģ has the
      Var. Nin-tud, EBELING, KTA. p. 121, 11. Symbols of these four
      deities on boundary stones in same register, HINKE, _A New Boundary
      Stone_, p. 28 second register, et passim.

  535 Possibly a metal stood here, identified with _d__MAŠ_, a star in
      Orion (Kaksidi= Beteigeuze), CT. 33, 2, 6; KING, _Magic_ 50, 29.

  536 Possibly the constellation Ursa Major. Margidda, the Wagon is
      intended, identified with Ninlil on a Berlin text, WEIDNER,
      _Handbuch_ 79, 10. See also BEZOLD in DEIMEL, _Pantheon Babylonicum_
      215.

  537 From the context certainly a title of Marduk. ZIM. 27 I 19 omits
      _LU-TU_.

  538 Or _Bêl-ṣarbe_, title of Nergal, v. VAB. IV 170, 67. Between lines
      17 and 18 the variant inserts two lines.

  539 But Mars in Amos 5, 26. I accept here the later identifications,
      Nergal-Mars, Ninurta-Saturn. The identifications in the earlier
      period of Babylonian astronomy appear to have been Ninurta-Mars and
      Nergal-Saturn.

  540 Probably the astronomical form of Nusku as god of the new moon, IV
      R. 23a 4. His character as fire god is symbolized by the torch, ZA.
      VI 242, 24. In II 10 supply _Gibil_ after ZIMMERN RT. 27, 5. As fire
      god he is messenger of Enlil.

_  541 Papsukal_, messenger of Zamama, god of Kiš, a form of Ninurta. He
      also like Nusku derives his messenger character from his connection
      with light, _Papsukal ša še-ir-ti_, Papsukal of the morning light,
      CT. 24, 40, 53. Since Ninurta is identified with Alpha of Orion,
      Pap-sukal is identified with one of the stars in Orion, CT. 33, 2 II
      2; _mul__sib-zi-an-na __d__Pap-sukal [sukal __d__Anim Ištar]_
      restored from VIROLLEAUD, _Supplement_ LXVII 10. Here he is
      messenger of heaven and of Ishtar as Venus, queen of heaven, that
      is, he is a messenger of the powers of celestial light. Nusku and
      Pap-sukal often occur together in magic texts, _Shurpu_ VIII 10.

  542 Here probably Sakkut as lord of light and justice, god of Isin, in
      his normal capacity. See BL. 120 n. 6. His emblem is something made
      of date palm, _šág, gišimmar_. This deity is unknown in magic texts
      except in ZIMMERN, Rt. 70, 8.

  543 Ishtar of Erech is Venus as evening star, the effeminate Venus of
      Erech, see _Tammuz and Ishtar_, 54 and 180 n. 4.

  544 Venus as morning star. The Ishtar of Agade was the type of war
      goddess, see op. cit. p. 100; hence Venus as morning star is
      sometimes called the Bow Star, KUGLER, _Sternkunde_ II 198.

  545 Western title of Geštinanna, sister of Ishtar. Here perhaps the
      constellation Virgo.

  546 The seven gods are the Pleiades, CT. 33, 2, 44. Since they are
      followed by Enmesharra perhaps here to be identified with the seven
      sons of Enmesharra (see BE. 31, 35). In ZA. VI 242, 20
      _gi-uru-gal-meš_, “the great reed spears” are symbols of the seven
      great gods, sons of Išhara. But traces of the last sign are not
      those of _MEŠ_ here.

  547 In astronomy a form of Nin-urta = Saturn, but by character allied to
      Nergal a lower world deity. See line 11 above. For E. as Saturn note
      V Raw. 46_a_ 21, his star _UDU-LIM_ and II R. 48, 52 the same star
      is _d__UDU-BAD-sag-uš = kaimânu_, Saturn. See also BE. 31, 35 n. 4
      line 12, _kaimānu_ title of Enmesharra.

_  548 šimeššalû_ employed in medical texts, see SAI. 3574 and JASTROW,
      _Medical Text_ Rev. 5. Here also without _giš_. HOLMA, _Beiträge zum
      assyrischen Lexicon_, p. 85, identified it with Syr. _šamšārā_,
      Persian and Arabic _šimšar_.

  549 Passim in medical and incantation texts, CT. 23, 45, 9; RA. 14, 88,
      6; EBELING, KTA. 26 R. 20; IV R. 55 No. 2, 18., etc.

  550 Here variant ZIM. Rt. 27 Obv. II begins.

  551 Written _sìg dar-a_.

  552 The name of this deity is not legible in ZIMMERN’S variant and the
      first sign of the name on the Nippur text is doubtful but apparently
      the _šeššig_ and _gunu_ of _Galu_, that is REC. 100 later _RAB+GAN_,
      (v. SAI. p. 155 note 1). After this sign ZIMMERN and I have seen a
      sign _KU_ or _ŠU_. _Labartu_ is usually written _RAB+GAN-ME_. Here
      we may have to do with some new ideogram for this deity. She is the
      daughter of Anu, HAUPT, ASKT. 94, 59. A prayer to the daughter of
      Anu is KING, _Magic_ No. 61, 5-21.

  553 ZIM. _SU_.

  554 But in ZA. VI 242, 23 symbol of Azagsud.

  555 But ZA. VI 242, 24 Nusku, fire god in Nippur pantheon.

  556 See MUSS-ARNOLT, p. 940. Also note _niknakku ša ḳu-ta-ri_, censer of
      incense, CT. 29, 50, 9; _ḳutari ša šipti_, incense pertaining to the
      ritual of the incantation, _ibid._ 20. _ḳutari_ is a plural form
      employed to denote several acts of fumigation.

  557 Reading established by Rev. II 8. But see MEEK, AJSL 31, 287, _li-si
      to ne-su(n)_ gloss on the star _Ne-sùn_; son of Ninlil, hence a star
      in Ninlil’s constellation Ursa Major, VIROLLEAUD, _Sin_ XIII 22.

  558 Perhaps _igi-sig-sig_; cf. CT. 24, 3, 25.

  559 In ZA. VI 242, 19, symbol of Enlil. But CT. 16, 24, 25 hero of Anu.
      In rituals generally with _kušgugalû_.

  560 Sword bearer (_nāš patri_) of Enlil, CT. 24, 10, 16.

  561 Symbol of Anu in ZA. VI 242, 19.

  562 Priest of Enlil, CT. 24, 10, 13. Cf. _GUD-NINDA = mîru_, young ox,
      SBC. 19, 14.

  563 ZA. VI 242, 15 gypsum is _d__MAŠ_.

  564 But ZA. VI 242, 15 bitumen is the _asakku_ demon.

  565 A pest demon son of Anu, III R. 69, 70. On the other hand, ZA. VI
      246, 22 the scapegoat represents the patron of flocks Ninamašazag
      who supplies the goat. When sin is transferred to the goat it falls
      under the protection of Kushu. See Rev. I 6.

  566 Cf. _d__En-udu-til-la_, SBP. 150 n. 5 I. 8.

  567 Patron of flocks and fire god.

  568 That is burnt offering.

  569 I. e. Ea as the god of potters. Nunurra is _paḫaru rabû_ of Anu,
      MEEK BA. X pt. 1 p. 42, 14. Note CT. 24, 14, 41, _d__Nun-ŭr-ra(duk)
      ḳa-[gaz_].

  570 Sic! Semitic.

  571 Cf. IV R. 28* No. 4 Rev. 3. The symbols in lines 24-6 are obscure.

  572 Lugalgirra and Meslamtaea.

  573 The temple of Gula and Ungal of Nippur, CLAY, BE. XV 34, 2. _Ungal_
      = _tênisêti_, population. God of the people of Nippur.

  574 See previous footnote.

  575 A form of Enki as patron of metallurgy. See RA. 12, 83 n. 5.

_  576 sun_ probable reading for _BAD_ in this sense. Offerings to the
      _giš-sun_, GENOUILLAC, _Drehem_, 5505 Obv. II 15.

  577 Sign a confusion of _NI+giš_ and _KAK+giš_, see RA. 13, 3.

_  578 Zû_, the eagle, bird of the blazing sun, Ninurta, Ningirsu, is the
      only emblematic animal that figures as a deity. The myth of his
      conflict with the serpent in the story of Etana dramatizes the old
      legend of the conflict between sun and clouds. He appears in magic
      here for the first time.

  579 See Vab. IV 154, 44 and note.

_  580 šu_ here for _ša_, feminine. The form should be dual.

  581 Gunu of _MA_ = _tittu_; Sumerian _peš_, value also assigned to _MA_
      = _tittu_ in the Chicago Syllabar, 115 f.

_  582 kīṣu_, compensation for _kiṣṣu_. See also STRASSMAIER, _Nabonidus_
      699, 24, _ki-ṣu_. Note that the _ḫulduppu_ (probably an image of a
      scapegoat) symbol of Kuši is placed opposite the door in ZIM. Rt. p.
      168, 29.

  583 CLAY, _Personal Names of the Cassite Period_, mentions a deity
      _Si-lak-ku-ku_(?). In any case a Cassite deity not mentioned in
      Babylonian lists and texts.

  584 Otherwise unknown. A Cassite deity(?).

  585 Probably same as _Abagal_, DEIMEL, _Pantheon_, p. 43.

  586 Cf. ZIMMERN, 27 R. 14-17.

  587 Written NU. Cf. ZIMMERN, 27 Rev. I 19.

  588 Cf. _ibid._ 21.

  589 Sign is _ḪU-gunu_ an error for _SI-gunu_. Only the latter sign has
      the values bright, burn. Line 8 proves that the sign is based on
      _SI_.

_  590 nīn-muš_. The sign _ŠEŠ_ has the value _muš_. Note SAI. 2629 the
      gloss _ga-an-ŠEŠ_ and variant _Chicago Syllabar_ 212 _ga-an-muš_.
      See also JRAS. 1905, 81-4-28 l. 14. For _muš = banû_ cf. SAI. 1916.

  591 This is a real library note and is clear evidence for assuming that
      the temple of Nippur possessed a library, at least in the Cassite
      period. For similar library notes on the tablets from Aššur, see RA.
      13, 99. Note also the Smith Esagila tablet published by SCHEIL,
      _Memoires de l’Academie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres XXXIX_,
      Rev. 7, _mûdû mûdâ likallim la mûdâ ul immar an pî duppi gabri
      Barsip-ki šaṭir-ma UB-ṬU ù ba-ri_. For _an pi (KA)_, see RA. 13, 92.

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
