           Serve More Complete Meals With Kellogg’s All-Bran

Perhaps the meals you serve are “bulk-minus” meals. Kellogg’s All-Bran
is the “bulk-plus” food so necessary in the well-balanced diet. Serve as
a cereal, combined with other cereals, or use it as an ingredient in
many tempting and economical dishes. ★ All the recipes in this helpful
folder have been triple tested in our Cottage Kitchen so that you may
get the fullest enjoyment from the use of All-Bran in your home. ★
Laboratory tests show (1) that All-Bran is a safe and gentle food that
relieves constipation due to insufficient “bulk”; (2) that it does not
lose its effectiveness with continued use; (3) that it is a good source
of iron and Vitamin B. ★ Kellogg’s All-Bran is accepted by the American
Medical Association Committee on Foods as a natural laxative food for
normal people.

                            BEST FOR COOKING


Kellogg’s All-Bran is an ideal ingredient for cooking. It blends well
with other ingredients because it is fine and soft and adds a tempting
nut-sweet flavor to the recipe. Remember, too, that this best of all
brans increases the value of each dish because of its abundant “bulk.”


ALL-BRAN MUFFINS

  2 tablespoons shortening
  ¼ cup sugar
  1 egg (well beaten)
  1 cup sour milk
  1 cup Kellogg’s ALL-BRAN
  1 cup flour
  1 teaspoon baking powder
  ½ teaspoon soda
  ½ teaspoon salt

  Note: If sweet milk is used instead of sour milk, omit the ½ teaspoon
  of soda and use 3 teaspoons baking powder. Raisins or dates may be
  added if desired. A small slice of apple, sprinkled with cinnamon and
  sugar, placed on top the muffin batter before baking, makes a
  delicious variation of the recipe.

Cream the shortening and sugar, add egg and sour milk. Add ALL-BRAN and
let soak until most of the moisture is taken up. Sift flour with baking
powder, soda and salt and add to first mixture, stirring only until
flour disappears. Fill greased muffin tins two-thirds full and bake in a
moderate oven (400° F.) for 20 to 25 minutes.

Yield: 8 large or 12 small muffins.

                            BEST FOR MIXING


The right foods are so important in keeping up family fitness. And the
responsibility is largely yours. Convert minus meals into complete meals
by mixing ALL-BRAN with other cereals, and with other ingredients in
making breads, waffles and cookies.


ALL-BRAN WAFFLES SUPREME

sifting dry ingredients. Stir sifted dry ingredients into the liquid
mixture; add melted butter and fold in stiffly beaten egg whites. Bake

                            BEST AS A CEREAL


The “bulk” content of Kellogg’s All-Bran is higher than that of any
other common food. It definitely corrects the “bulk-minus” meal—the most
frequent cause of constipation.

When common constipation due to “bulk-minus” meals does occur, your
family begins to feel under par—not exactly sick, but certainly not
well. Avoid this condition by serving All-Bran regularly for regularity.

Try All-Bran as a cereal with milk or cream—two tablespoons daily will
give you the “bulk-plus” meals so necessary in the well-balanced diet.
In chronic cases, with each meal. All-Bran is much more effective than
part-bran products. Sold by all grocers. Made by Kellogg in Battle
Creek, Michigan.

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
