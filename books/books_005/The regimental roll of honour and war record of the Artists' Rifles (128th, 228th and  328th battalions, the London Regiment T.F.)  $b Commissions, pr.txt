                               FOREWORD

                                  BY

                   COLONEL H. A. R. MAY, C.B., V.D.,

              _recently Commanding the Artists’ Rifles_.


As one who has been intimately connected with the Corps for nearly
forty years, and who yields place to none in his interest in, and love
for, his old Regiment, I have awaited the publication of this Roll of
Honour of the Artists’ Rifles with an eagerness that I would find it
hard to describe. For it is a Record of which, not only every past or
present member of the Regiment, but everyone who values the proved
possibilities of the Territorial Force may rightly be proud.

The story it tells is one of alert and patriotic acceptance of the
responsibilities cast upon us by the war, of many thousands of officers
trained for service in the field, of duty nobly done, of gallant
service rendered--even unto death. And in no boasting rhetoric is the
tale related: the narrative unfolds itself, modestly and simply, in
columns of names and figures which speak more eloquently perhaps than
any letterpress that could accompany them. Every line records good
service voluntarily rendered: one in every seven lines denotes the
splendid tragedy of a promising young life sacrificed for his country.

The book contains a complete record of all whose names have been
inscribed in our Muster Roll since August, 1914; of Commissions
obtained; of honours and decorations awarded (with particulars, where
published, of the deeds by which they were gained); and of casualties
suffered.

This colossal work, although I know it has been a labour of love, has
been compiled and edited with immense and continuous care, spread over
some years, by Major S. Stagoll Higham, V.D., assisted by a
devoted band of willing and enthusiastic helpers, to all of whom the
gratitude of every comrade is due--and is given. It is issued with
pride to preserve for future generations the memory of men who, when
the occasion arose voluntarily served their country and their Regiment
in the greatest emergency.

The time has almost come when the feelings with which we regard the
greatest possible Sacrifice made by our best and bravest during the
awful days of 1914–18 begin to be free from regret and longing and
sadness. And my earnest wish and hope is that when the relatives and
friends of those Artists who were then called upon to give up all turn
the pages of this book, they will be strengthened to do so with pride
and thankfulness only.

Despite the gloom that may sometimes come to us at happenings in these
present times, my firm conviction is that so long as we can produce men
of the quality of those whose names and deeds are enshrined in this
Roll of Honour we can go forward joyfully and with every confidence
into the unknown future. And may we all be inspired to carry out our
present obligations and duties patriotically, and to live henceforth
lives worthy of the example of those 2,003 Artists who died for us that
we as an Empire might live. This would be the best War Memorial of all.

   _November 11th, 1921._




                           EDITOR’S PREFACE.


At an Army examination in 1913 the candidates, who included a few
Officers of the Artists in pursuit of the coveted “Q,” were confronted
with the following conundrum:--

   “_Supposing a war continues--What machinery exists in England
   for supplying the wastage in Officers?_”

Little did any of those candidates dream how soon this question would
insist on an immediate answer: that within the next twelve months the
old regular Army, hopelessly out-gunned, would have been sacrificed:
and that the nation would be called upon to provide, and would
eventually succeed in producing, from civilians, upwards of a quarter
of a million new Officers.

Still less did any member of the Artists then imagine that the quota
of such new Officers furnished by his own Battalion of amateur
soldiers--one of the original Rifle Volunteer Corps that was raised
by Painters and Art students in post-Crimean days and incorporated
in 1908 in the new Territorial Force as the “28th London (Artists
Rifles)”--would run into five figures. Or that within a few months of
the outbreak of hostilities ex-Artists (over 1,000 in number) would
have been gazetted to every regular infantry regiment in the British
Army including all the Foot Guards.

There is no more striking incident in the whole history of the Corps,
since the day when in beards and shakos our ancestors made their first
appearance on parade, than the story of the first little batch of
men suddenly called out of our ranks to replace, in the field, Army
Officers who had become casualties.

From this small beginning, extemporised to meet an emergency, sprang
the huge organisation which in the words of Earl French may be said
to have laid the foundation of that Officers’ School of War whose
ramifications were soon to extend, not only behind all the fighting
lines, but throughout the United Kingdom. By the end of the war this
Territorial unit had furnished over 10,000 Officers to our big Armies,
as chronicled in detail in the following pages, and had also trained in
its schools in France and in England several thousand cadets from other
Regiments, in addition to maintaining latterly a fighting Battalion in
the line.


                         THE FIRST BATTALION.

On the 2nd August, 1914, the 2nd London Division T.F. to which the
Artists were allocated as Army Troops, assembled on Salisbury Plain for
their annual camp. At midnight the Division was recalled post-haste
to London and on the 5th August was mobilised for active service and
placed on duty the same day. Within a fortnight it moved out to its
War Station in Hertfordshire, minus the Artists, who were left behind,
much to their chagrin “to help in the defence of London.” Quartered
successively at Manchester Street Schools, Lord’s Cricket Ground,
and the Tower, they presently rejoined their Division in the country
but had not been there a week when at less than 48 hours’ notice the
Battalion was embarked overseas, landing in the critical period at the
end of October, 1914.

On their way up to Ypres they were dramatically halted at Bailleul by
a Staff-Officer (as it happened, an old Artists Adjutant, Col. Romer)
with an urgent message from the Commander-in-Chief who wished to see
them. They de-bussed and were visited by him there. The result of an
historic interview between him and Colonel May was that a few days
later some 50 “other ranks,” public school and University men who had
taken to heart Lord Roberts’ warning and trained in peace time, were
rapidly given some practical tips, promoted to Second Lieutenant and
the next day went straight into action (still wearing their Territorial
private’s uniform and Artists badge with the addition of a “pip”)
against some of Germany’s most famous Regiments, in command of seasoned
regular soldiers of the immortal Seventh Division.[1]

The experiment of thus attaching Artists to the Old Contemptibles as
“Probationary Officers” having proved successful, a further batch was
called for and orders were issued by the G.O.C. directing the Battalion
to be transformed into an Officers’ Training Corps to be drawn on from
time to time to supply Officers, the remainder being retained as a
fighting unit to be used as occasion demanded. He thus refers to the
matter in his first Despatch.

   “I established the Battalion as a Training Corps for officers
   in the field. The cadets pass through a course, which includes
   some thoroughly practical training as all cadets do a tour of
   48 hours in the trenches, and afterwards write a report on what
   they see and notice. They also visit an observation post of a
   battery or group of batteries, and spend some hours there. A
   Commandant has been appointed, and he arranges and supervises
   the work, sets schemes for practice, administers the school,
   delivers lectures, and reports on the candidates. The cadets are
   instructed in all branches of military training suitable for
   platoon commanders. Machine-gun tactics, a knowledge of which
   is so necessary for all junior officers, is a special feature
   of the course of instruction. When first started the school was
   able to turn out officers at the rate of 75 a month. This has
   since been increased to 100. Reports received from Divisional
   and Army Corps Commanders on officers who have been trained at
   the school are most satisfactory.”

Earl French has since on several occasions written and spoken on this
subject in generous terms and in particular at a recent reunion of
survivors, when he said:--

   “I shall never, never forget the first visit I paid to the
   Artists after they landed in France, or the wonderful impression
   they left on my mind of the possibilities which were in that
   Corps of furnishing a want which was so terrible to all of us at
   that time, the supply of officers. What really influenced me in
   trying the experiment I had to try was the appreciation I had
   of the splendid material of which I saw you were composed, and
   of the marked aptitude of Colonel May and those who helped him
   for organizing and commanding such a Corps. Just at the period
   I am speaking of we had suffered fearful casualties, and the
   proportion of losses in officers was higher than in any other
   rank, and it was going on every day. I was really positively
   at my wits’ end, suffering almost agony, to know where I could
   get officer reinforcements. You all know how any fighting force
   must deteriorate, and deteriorate badly, unless this supply of
   officers is kept up properly and regularly.

   Well, in this trouble and difficulty the Artists came to my
   help, and I shall never forget as long as I live the courage,
   the determination, the skill, the organizing power which they
   displayed in trying to meet my wishes. By day and by night,
   almost under the enemy’s guns, and very often under close
   rifle-fire in the trenches, they commenced, they carried on,
   and they developed this work to the very highest standard of
   efficiency, and they showed clearly what men of energy and skill
   could do in this direction when they knew how. They taught us,
   indeed, a very great lesson, among the many lessons which all
   we regular soldiers had to learn in the war. We never knew
   what the possibilities were before. We used to talk about it
   taking two years to train an artillery driver, and, above all
   things, we said we could not turn out officers under a certain
   considerable length of time. Well the Artists showed us we made
   a mistake there, because they turned out a most efficient body
   of officers, and kept up everything they said they would. From
   that moment they became the model for and an example to that
   large number of training establishments all over France, which
   to the end of the war turned out officers with the utmost speed
   and the utmost efficiency. What they suffered in doing it is
   recorded in this book which I now hold in my hand (Artists
   Rifles Regimental Roll of Honour, 1914–1919), and I may recall
   at this moment, without frivolity, the fact that these boys,
   all of them, looked death straight in the face, laughing and
   smiling, and that the Artists earned at that time the sobriquet
   of ‘The Suicide Club.’ That, perhaps, is the highest honour that
   could be paid to them.”

The School in France was originally run entirely by Colonel May and his
Officers and Sergeants, but presently, as the enemy pressure relaxed,
he had the advantage of the assistance of Regular Officers (one of
whom was appointed “Commandant of School”) and gradually as additional
candidates for commissions began to arrive from other regiments, the
two units were worked as separate organisations.

In April, 1915, quarters were changed from Bailleul to St. Omer and a
new Commandant to the school was appointed, which from that date became
“G.H.Q. School.” Thereafter Artists who came out in drafts, together
with selected N.C.O’s. from Cavalry, Artillery, Canadian and other
units sent up for instruction in Infantry work, were first trained in
“the Colonel’s Class” and on passing out went on to this School until
July, 1916, when the Battalion was specially authorised by Earl Haig to
send candidates approved by their C.O. direct to Commissions.

Another branch of their early activities was the staffing of the
Machine Gun School at Visques, near G.H.Q., which was started by a
Hythe Instructor (Major Baker-Carr), who had one Hythe Sergeant to
assist him. They trained as assistants 16 men from the Artists, who
in their turn trained others of their comrades, until eventually
multitudes of little groups (each of eight Officers or N.C.O’s.
temporarily withdrawn from the trenches) were daily to be seen dotted
all over the parade ground keenly studying the intricacies and tactics
of the weapon, expounded to them by an Artists’ Sergeant who had
specialised in the subject. A large proportion of such Instructors
afterwards passed on to Commissions in the M.G. Corps, Tanks, R.F.C.,
and other units where their expert knowledge was invaluable.[2]

Reinforced from time to time by strong drafts, the special task of
supplying and training Officers thus undertaken by the Artists kept
them at G.H.Q. (where as “Headquarters Battalion” they were also
entrusted with multifarious other and responsible duties) for about 2½
years. During this period there were of course considerable changes in
personnel. The bulk of the original N.C.O’s. and men had soon obtained
Commissions, while senior Captains had been promoted to command
Battalions in the field, and many junior Officers had been attached
or transferred to regular Regiments. In December, 1915, Col. May was
invalided home. On recovering from a severe illness he was appointed
to the important post, which he held till the end of the War, of
Commandant at Tidworth of the Southern Command School of Instruction
for Infantry Officers, where over 14,000 Officers (including 5,000
Australians) passed through his curriculum. He was succeeded in France
by his Second-in-command, Lt. Col. Chatfeild-Clarke, who carried
on until the summer of 1917, when the authorities decided to close
down Cadet Schools in France and to send all future candidates for
Commissions back to England for training. Thereupon the remaining
Officers and men, less 200 cadets whose training was on the point of
completion, at last had an opportunity of fulfilling the role for
which the Artists had volunteered in 1914 (the reason they then went
to France), of going into action together as a fighting unit, and they
were allotted to the 190th Brigade in the Royal Naval Division (63rd).

There was nothing very nautical about the 190th, the explanation being
that there were not enough naval men available at that time to make up
an entire Division, so the Army was called in to complete it by adding
four Battalions.

Appended to this Preface is an abridged account of their adventures
in the line for which the Editor is indebted to Captains Money and
Hewitt and to Col. Goldthorp, whose contribution is of especial value
as shewing the impressions, necessarily unbiassed by preconceived
Regimental associations, of a “foreign” C.O. when in command of a
Battalion of the Artists. His very live account of a modern battle will
be of absorbing interest, both to those who have shared this experience
and to those who have not been through the mill.


                         THE SECOND BATTALION.

Prior to the departure of the original Battalion overseas, a second
(Reserve) Battalion, distinguished as “2/28th London,” had been raised
under the command of Col. Horsley, the late Commanding Officer of
the Artists, who was assisted by Officers transferred from the First
Battalion (1/28th) or promoted from the ranks. Enrolment started on
the 31st August, 1914, and within a week 5,000 would-be recruits had
applied for admission, ‘Varsity Blues, rowing men and athletes of every
description, mostly without any previous military training. Uniforms
and arms were for a time unobtainable, but soon every one of the 1,000
selected recruits had succeeded in purchasing a khaki outfit at ruinous
prices, from somewhere, and presently the authorities unearthed a large
supply of ancient Martini-Henry carbines. The sole equipment then
provided was a regulation water-bottle for each man but with no means
of attaching the same to the person of the soldier. Mufti overcoats
were worn en banderole and rations were carried in neat brown paper
packets tied on to waist-belts of every hue and shape.

After three or four months recruit training with only 50 modern rifles
available, interspersed with daily journeys into Kent of strong
working parties to assist in the construction of “the last ditch,” the
Battalion was properly equipped and armed and moved to Roehampton,
thence to camp in Richmond Park where they also initiated a valuable
machine gun school.

Like many similar units this Reserve Battalion was eventually drained
dry in supplying drafts to its 1st Battalion overseas. It also
furnished Officers for the New Armies and some other Territorial
Units. Col. Horsley was then appointed to the command of the 104th
Provisional Battalion for Home Defence, stationed at the Tower of
London, and eventually finished up his 42 years service in the Artists
by proceeding overseas to a Staff appointment as Area Commandant at
Englebelmer in France.


        THE THIRD BATTALION AND NO. 15 (ARTISTS’ RIFLES) O.C.B.

Meanwhile on the 1st January, 1915, by which date old Artists and
others were beginning to arrive from the Colonies for training as
Officers, a third Battalion, “3/28th London” had been started (at first
severely restricted to two Companies under a Major), in which all
subsequent recruits had to be enrolled. It was placed under the command
of Lt.-Col. William Shirley, an old friend of the Corps, recently
retired from the Indian Army, who had been acting as Second-in-command
of 2/28th. He brought very special qualifications to the post, having
been for some years an Army Instructor in India, at Sandhurst, and
at Cambridge University, where on the outbreak of war he was holding
the appointment of Director of Military Studies. On occasions this
Battalion, which was principally officered in the first instance by
senior N.C.O’s sent home for the purpose from 1/28th in France, was
over 3,000 strong and in 3½ years had passed 9,352 recruits through
its ranks. After a period of recruit training in London, which
included the construction at Kenwood of a series of entrenchments and
dug-outs on the most up-to-date Continental models, it also went into
camp in Richmond Park, whence it was moved in July, 1915, to High
Beech in Epping Forest, thence to Hare Hall, Romford, and finally to
Berkhampstead, and on the absorption of the original 2nd Battalion by
the 1st it was re-numbered 2/28th.[3]

In May, 1915, instructions were issued for the formation within this
Battalion of a separate School of Instruction for newly gazetted
Officers of other Territorial regiments on similar lines to the School
in France and during the next few months upwards of 1,500 such Officers
passed through the School courses and examinations.

In November, 1915, the Regiment was officially recognised by Army
Order[4] as an Officers’ Training Corps, and the Home Battalion became
the 2nd Artists Rifles O.T.C.

In March, 1916, its separate School, then at Gidea Park, was converted
into four Companies of cadets to which recruits were passed on for
training as Officers after receiving a preliminary military training
in the ranks of the other four Companies, the whole being under the
command of Colonel Shirley and run by Artists’ Officers and Sergeant
Instructors. In August, 1916, by which date the organisation of Officer
Cadet Battalions throughout the United Kingdom had been perfected, the
four Cadet Companies were separated from Colonel Shirley’s Battalion
and transformed into “No. 15 (Artists Rifles), O.C.B.” which was placed
under the command of Lt.-Col. E. St. L. Shaw (1st East Surrey) an
invalided Regular Officer, with a Staff of Artists and other Officers
and Sergeant Instructors. Thenceforth recruits enrolled in 3/28th were
sent, on completion of their preliminary training, indiscriminately
to No. 15 or to any other O.C.B. in which there were vacancies at the
moment, while No. 15 as part of the general scheme of these O.C.B.’s
received Cadets from other units besides the Artists.

In 1918 Colonel Shaw was succeeded by Colonel Gascoigne who retained
command of this O.C.B. until the end of the War.

In July, 1918, Colonel Shirley was compelled by ill-health to
relinquish the command of 3/28th, and was succeeded by Lt.-Col.
Ostle (an Artists Officer who went out in October, 1914, as a junior
Captain, rose to be Second-in-command of the 2nd Border Regiment, and
subsequently commanded two different Battalions in the Field before
being sent home to Hospital.

       *       *       *       *       *

The history of this publication is shortly as follows:--

Early in 1915, the Editor, as an Officer who had served in all three
Battalions, was deputed by the three Commanding Officers to keep a
record of Commissions and Honours then being obtained by members of
the Regiment and of casualties suffered, there being in the nature of
things no provision in Official regimental documents or T.F. Records
for following up the career of a man after he had been struck off the
Artists on obtaining a Commission in another unit. Correspondents were
appointed in each Battalion to assist the Editor, and on the first
anniversary of the Declaration of War the first Edition of the present
work, containing 1508 names, was published.

The intention was to re-issue the pamphlet periodically until the end
of the War, and on the second anniversary a second Edition brought up
to date, containing 3434 Commissions, was printed and on the point of
distribution when the Press Bureau Order was issued, which prohibited
any reference to places, numbers of Battalions and other details in
which the book abounded.

These copies were accordingly sealed up, but monthly supplemental lists
were published in the Regimental Journal for a time, the publicity
thus obtained being a valuable check against error. Presently the
Journal itself was also suspended for some months, but eventually it
was allowed to reappear, and the supplemental lists were resumed after
being shorn of all offending details, and were continued until the
Armistice.

It then became necessary to dig out from every available source the
particulars which had not been previously obtainable, such as dates
and places of deeds and deaths, and this research has occupied an
unconscionable time. Still it has been done, and the result is a much
more complete and reliable record than was previously obtainable.

With regard to the plan of the book, the original scheme was to make
it a record only of Commissions and Honours, with a list of casualties
in all ranks, but whilst this final edition was in the press a very
strong desire was expressed for a complete Roll comprising every one
of the 15,000 Artists who at one time or another during the War had
served in the Regiment in any capacity. An additional Section No. IV
has therefore been compiled and added containing the names of all
N.C.O.’s and privates who are not known to have taken Commissions.
Here, however, the Editor came up against an insurmountable difficulty.
It soon became evident that this Section not having been, like the rest
of the book, entered up from day to day, it would now be absolutely
impossible to ascertain what had happened to a very large number of
men who had been discharged or transferred to other Regiments since
August, 1914. In these circumstances it has not been practicable to
make Section IV more than an alphabetical list of some 4,800 “other
ranks” not included in the Roll of Commissions, with the addition of
reference letters and symbols indicating those who are known to have
served overseas with the 1st Battalion or in other units, or to have
been killed, wounded, etc.

It is probable that there may be discovered in this Section the
names of many men who had in fact obtained Commissions, some further
casualties, and possibly a hidden D.S.O. or other Honour.

In these circumstances it will be realised, and the Editor desires to
emphasize the fact, that the absence of any reference letter against
a man’s name in Section IV is no reflection upon him. It simply means
that the news of his promotion, reward or other event has not reached
the Regiment. And the list includes the very large number of cadets who
were under instruction in England on the cessation of hostilities, at
least 2,000; also men discharged during the War as medically unfit.

The Editor much regrets that he is compelled strictly to limit this
Section IV to those who enlisted originally in the Artists, as
recruits. He recognises that this means the exclusion of those members
of other units who were transferred or attached to the 1st Battalion
in France, wore their regimental badge, fought and died with them.
Probably they are included in their own Regimental War Records, but
they were all so thoroughly imbued with the spirit and traditions of
their new unit, that he would willingly have inserted in this book
every one of the hundreds of additional names had the exigencies
of space and expense permitted. He has, however, been sufficiently
inconsistent to include their Officers, together with their Military
Crosses and other Honours if gained whilst serving with the Artists.

In conclusion, the Editor warmly acknowledges his very great
indebtedness to his hosts of correspondents in every theatre of war,
to sympathetic Record Officers at home and abroad, and to the patient
and painstaking members of his constantly changing staff, without whose
meticulous care in the laborious daily task of searching Gazettes and
Casualty Lists against their ever-growing Card Index, the compilation
of this gigantic record would have fallen through. To enumerate all
those who during a period of nearly five years lent a hand in this way,
invalids and light duty men at home, Officers and men on leave, cadets
awaiting Gazette, and other keen helpers would fill pages, and it is
useless to attempt it.

In the mass of detail dealt with in this work and the circumstances
under which it was collected, there are no doubt mistakes and
omissions: possibly a considerable number. To meet such cases the copy
of the book which is to be deposited in the War Memorial recently
erected at Headquarters will be interleaved and if short particulars
of any serious error that may be discovered are forwarded to “The Hon.
Secretary, Roll of Honour,” Artists Rifles, Duke’s Road, Euston Road,
W.C.2, it shall be rectified in such Headquarters copy. Arrangements
may also be made for periodical publication of lists of corrections in
the Regimental Journal.

From July to Sept. 1917, the Division was in the front line (“R3”
and “R4” Sectors, Oppy and Gavrelle) and with the exception of a few
casualties, nothing of special note occurred during this period so
far as the Artists’ were concerned. After a normal tour, the Division
was relieved by the 47th (formerly 2/London) Division, the Artists
themselves being replaced by the 22/London, commanded by Lt. Col. C. F.
H. Greenwood, an Artists’ Officer, and moved to La Comté.

On coming out of the line inexorable Anno Domini deprived us of our
Commanding Officer, Col. Chatfeild-Clarke, while our esprit de corps
was momentarily ruffled by the appearance of a reinforcing draft
composed not of Artists, but of 119 men from another unit.

It was recognised however that pooling, not only of reinforcements but
of C.O’s. was now inevitable: that as no other Battalion overseas was
being exclusively fed from its own Regiment, the Artists could not
expect different treatment.

During the ensuing twelve months they had five new Commanding Officers,
all drawn from other Regiments.


                             OCTOBER 1917.

In October, the Division was ordered to the Ypres front: we journeyed
to Houtkerque, thence to Reigersburgh and on the 28th left camp for our
first big fight, the C.O. Major Edlmann, bringing news, that owing to
the impossible state of the ground the Divisional front had not been
advanced so far as had been expected, so that what was to have been our
jumping off line would now be our objective. During the next thirty
hours we suffered a good many casualties from long range artillery
fire, D Co. losing their C.S.M., C. W. W. King.

The story of the battle for the Passchendaele Ridge, so far as the
Artists are concerned, is soon told. Other Divisions before us had
been taking their share in the slow process of gaining ground in
this water-logged area, at tremendous cost. The 188th was the first
Brigade of the 63rd Division to attack; and advancing under a terrific
artillery and machine-gun barrage they, too, made some headway, but
suffered severely. Early on the 30th our Brigade attacked, also under a
very heavy barrage: the British artillery averaged one gun to every 9
yards of front. To reach our objective we had to cross the Paddebeeke,
on the map an insignificant streamlet, but in fact by this time a wide
and almost impassable swamp.

                 {  _B Co. (Capt. Bare)._    _A Co. (Capt. Mieville)._
_ORDER OF BATTLE_{        _C Co. (Capt. Chetwood) Support._
                 {          _D Co. (Capt. Royds) Reserve._

The instant our attack started, the forward troops came under intense
machine-gun fire from an almost invisible enemy who had taken refuge
in their “pill boxes” during our bombardment, and were now posted in
carefully chosen tactical positions. Simultaneously our supporting
troops suffered heavy casualties from enemy artillery, while the ground
to be traversed was a deep sea of mud, which drowned wounded men and
clogged rifles and Lewis guns in the first few minutes, rendering them
entirely useless. Consequently it was not long before the attack was
brought to a complete standstill, and the very attenuated Battalions
proceeded to consolidate as best they could on our side of the
Paddebeeke.[8] On our right the Canadians continued to advance: being
on higher and drier ground they were able to get on, so that presently
there was a dangerous gap between their left and our right. This was
closed by sending up the Shropshires from our Brigade reserve.

On this day the Artists went into action about 500 strong and suffered
350 casualties, amongst those killed being Captains Bare, Chetwood and
Gordon Williams, Lieuts. Haslam and Howe, and our splendid Padre, Capt.
Harry Dickinson. The toll of deaths would have been still higher but
for the untiring efforts of our M.O., Capt. Matthew, who for 72 hours
hardly rested from the work of collecting and dressing the wounded.[9]

The task set the Division appeared to be an impossible one, and no
doubt would not have been attempted but for the urgent necessity
of those tremendous attacks in this sector, which drew away all
the enemy’s reserves from other points where it was of the utmost
importance to prevent his attacking in force. It was not a case of
lives being fruitlessly thrown away, but of sacrifices which enabled
the whole Allied line to remain intact at a time when the Russian
débacle was straining to the utmost our resources on the Western Front.

The next day the remains of the Battalion moved out of the line to
refit, and while at Eringhem received a special message of sympathy
in respect of their losses, and congratulations on the part they had
played in the battle, brought direct to them from Earl Haig. They
learned also from the Canadians (who were loud in their praises of the
way in which our men had pressed forward) that several Artists had
succeeded in actually crossing the Paddebeeke before being killed.


                            DECEMBER, 1917.

After a period of rest and reorganisation (during which Lt.-Col. John
Harington, 3/Rifle Brigade, took over the command, Major Edlmann was
appointed O.C. 63rd Divisional Wing, and substantial reinforcements
arrived, including 6 Officers and a draft from 3/28th), the Battalion
was on its way back to the Passchendaele sector, when the successful
British offensive before Cambrai was checked and the Boche began
to press back the wedge that had been driven into his line there.
Thereupon the 63rd Division was sent to the Somme district, and at
the end of December moved into the front line in the Marcoing salient
(Couillet Wood sector).

On the 30th the enemy launched a terrific attack and succeeded in
penetrating the front line to the east of the Welsh Ridge salient.
The Artists who were in support at this point were detailed for a
counter-attack which had to be made without artillery support. It was
pressed for all we were worth but resulted in very heavy casualties
without the achievement of our object. However, we heard subsequently
that our efforts were not in vain as the enemy, deceived as to the
strength of our available reserves by the promptitude and determination
with which the counter-attack was delivered, refrained from exploiting
their initial success. Had they done so, it is conceivable that their
object in driving us from the Welsh Ridge might have been attained.

                 { _A Co. (Capt. Pike)_----_B Co. (Lieut. Skinner)._
_ORDER OF BATTLE_{         _D Co. (Capt. Barnett) Support._
                 {        _C Co. (Capt. Lepingwell) Reserve._

A very gruelling night followed, consolidation work having to be
carried out in ground which was frozen hard. Sufficient praise cannot
be given to the Medical Staff under Capt. Mathew, M.C., who were again
working all day at high pressure and at night did much to assist in the
recovery of the wounded men who were lying out in front of our line.
Excellent work was accomplished by D Co. under Capt. Barnett in forming
a defensive left flank, by Capt. Mieville in reconnaissance, and by
Lt. Holland, these officers gaining on that occasion very hard-earned
M.C’s.[10] Lt. Margetson also earned recognition for good work in the
maintenance of signal communication[11] and R.S.M. Emslie did much
to keep things going by the organisation of carrying parties to get
hot food up during the night. One Corporal did yeoman service to his
Company by going back under heavy fire, crossing a gas-filled valley
and bringing up the Company water supply which had had to be abandoned
in the rush of the morning.

Our casualties were nine Officers and 110 other ranks. Lieuts.
Salisbury, English, Shinner and Lightfoot, with our M.G. Officer
(Groom) and Intelligence Officer (Godfrey) were killed, while Pike,
Lepingwell and Holland were wounded, and from this date the Battalion
ceased to be exclusively officered by Artists. But although Officers
and men came to us from many other Regiments the spirit and traditions
of the Corps were maintained to the end: one of the most striking
features in connection with the arrival of reinforcements from other
units was the rapidity with which our new comrades assimilated Artists’
ideas and methods of getting things done.


                         JANUARY-MARCH, 1918.

During January and February, 1918, we put in further tours of duty
in the front line (during one of which both the Boche and ourselves
lived on top behind our respective parados, the trenches having become
nothing but ditches of liquid mud several feet deep), while Col.
Harrington left us to command the 2/Rifle Brigade (eventually becoming
a Brigadier-General), and Major Lathom who had been temporarily in
command of the Fusiliers was appointed acting C.O. of the Artists.

The Brigade was then withdrawn to Divisional Reserve at Beaulencourt
where we were joined by Major F. S. B. Johnson, 1/Royal Lancaster, as
our own new C.O. and our strength was brought up to 28 Officers and 766
other ranks by the addition of a complete half Battalion of the 2nd
Bn. London Rifle Brigade which had been broken up on the formation of
3-Battalion Brigades.

       *       *       *       *       *

In March we returned to the Couillet Wood sector, and on the 21st
had our first experience of the anxious times experienced by the
Allies during the Spring of 1918. Shortly after daybreak, while in
camp in Havrincourt Wood, we were aroused by a violent bombardment.
A dense gas and smoke cloud passed through the Wood as we moved to
our battle positions. On the way up Lt. Lintott, L.R.B. (formerly an
Artist Sergeant), was killed. The next night we were ordered back to
Havrincourt Wood as the enemy had gained a considerable amount of
ground on our right (the Fifth Army Front). During the withdrawal, Lt.
J. I. Royds was killed in Trescault. We started to dig in, but the next
morning were retired to a defence line east of Ytres. There we again
made ready to fight a rearguard action, but we were again disappointed
as we were directed to withdraw on a line Ytres--Bus-le-Transloy. That
night the whole Brigade withdrew into Ytres, and as communication
with both Brigade and Divisional H.Q. was lost, a meeting of all the
C.O.’s in the Brigade was called, and it was arranged that the Brigade
should form a defensive flank extending East-West, to conform with the
withdrawal of the 2nd Division on our left. The Brigade was then taken
over by Lt.-Col. Collings Wells of the 4th Bedfords, who for his good
work during the withdrawal was awarded the V.C.[12]

We moved to our new position about midnight, the route taken leading
us past the vast ammunition and petrol dump which was being destroyed.
Here a shell splinter from the dump wounded Major Lathom, who was
carried back to Beaulencourt. C Co., under Lt. Eric Willis, was also
unfortunate in running into a Boche M.G. post and suffering severe
casualties. Good work was done by Sergt. A. Coviello, who succeeded
in penetrating the enemy lines in rear of us and establishing
communication.[13] Next morning the retirement continued through
Barastre with heavy casualties (amongst whom was Lt. Dow, our
American M.O.) to Beaulencourt, where we found Brigade H.Q. Then back
through Gueudecourt, Flers, Bazentin-le-Grand, Bazentin-le-Petit to
Courcelette, and the next day’s trek took us through Pozieres to
Thiepval. On the slopes in that neighbourhood we had an opportunity
of checking the Boche, great work being done by a Lewis Gun team, for
whom the Brigade Major was spotting. During the night orders came to
cross at Authuille to the west bank of the river before daybreak, when
the R.E.’s were to destroy the bridges. On reaching the other side we
found the 12th Division waiting to take over from us. To celebrate
the conclusion of our long innings, Bn. H.Q. indulged in a game of
stump cricket which was rather spoilt by the arrival of a Hun H.V.
shell. It ruined the pitch and scattered the field, but fortunately no
one retired hurt. We then marched through Martinsart to Englebelmer,
and the same evening moved to Millencourt for an attack on another
Divisional front on the outskirts of Albert. This attempt to dislodge
the Boche proved fruitless and resulted in somewhat serious casualties,
chief among which was the loss of Lt. Eric Willis.

The Battalion was then withdrawn (via Senlis and Mailly Maillet) to
Forceville for a complete rest over Easter. Our total casualties during
the retirement amounted to 17 officers and 300 other ranks.


                          APRIL-AUGUST, 1918.

During April and May we performed tours of duty in the new line
established after the retreat north of Mesnil and in Aveluy Wood
sector. We lost Capt. Neighbour (who had rejoined us in March) through
sickness and Col. Johnson was wounded in Aveluy Wood. Thereupon Capt.
Wilkinson (L.R.B.) assumed command. In June the Battalion went into
Corps reserve at Toutencourt Wood and was attached to the “flying”
Corps, kept for operations on any front, and throughout July we were
engaged in line holding alternately between Acheux Wood south of
Auchonvillers and the line north of Mesnil.

In August, on the eve of the Australian offensive before Amiens,
we went to Beaucourt-sur-l’Hallue. After their attack had been
successfully launched the Division marched north again via Famechon to
Souastre, whence we moved out via Fonquevillers to take our part in
the commencement of that vast movement which resulted in the eventual
overthrow of the enemy. The Division attacked on the 21st in heavy
mist supported by a very intense artillery barrage and at the end of
the day the Artists found themselves in the front line, having passed
unconsciously through the Battalion we were supporting who had lost
direction to a certain extent and moved too far to the right.

The next morning the C.O. and Adjt. (Capt. Barnett) were wounded and
we sustained our most deeply regretted casualty in the death of R.S.M.
Peter Emslie, who was ever a magnificent stand-by in the line, where
his courageous efficiency rendered him at all times invaluable. The
Battalion was brought out by Lieuts. Bayne and Besch.

On the 24th at Achiet-le-Petit we went over in close support of the
188th Brigade in a heavy ground mist intermingled with gas and smoke.
Objectives were carried and the attack turned south-east towards
Warlencourt and Ligny-Thilloy where stout opposition was encountered
and the attack delivered on the following morning in conjunction with
the Canadians failed. The Division was then withdrawn via Irles,
Miraumont, Achiet-le-Petit, Bucquoy, Ayette to Boiry St. Rictrude.

The next day we moved into trenches at Boiry-Becquerelle, and on the
26th we followed up the attack as Division in reserve, the attacking
waves passing through Fontaine and Hendecourt to Caignicourt, and so on
to the Hindenburg line between Inchy and Moeuvres.


                           SEPTEMBER, 1918.

Early in September the Division was withdrawn by stages to Bailleulval
on the Arras-Doullens road, where we remained for a period of rest and
“fattening.” On leaving we received an address from the Mayor thanking
us on behalf of the population for our considerate treatment of them
and their belongings.

We then marched back again to the Croisilles area, the Artists finding
a home in tents and shelters on the high ground south-east of St.
Leger near L’Homme Mort Wood. Here we were joined by our new C.O., Lt.
Col. Goldthorp (4/West Riding), who shall now continue the narrative.

       *       *       *       *       *

I think that my story, such as it is, had better take the form of
a sort of letter. It was late on the night of 18/19th September,
1918, when I reached the 63rd R.N.D. Wing, then at Boisleux-au-Mont,
where I was welcomed by Major Edlmann, the O.C. Wing, and Capt.
Baillie-Hamilton, the Adjutant, who informed me that I was either for
the Artists or the Bedfords, who were both without C.O.’s.

The following morning I was taken forward to Divisional H.Q. in
dug-outs between St. Leger and Ecoust, and I was officially told that
I was to take over the command of the Artists. After reporting to
the Brigadier, General Lesslie, who proceeded to tell me all he knew
about the Artists as a Regiment and about the officers individually, I
set out on my lonely journey across a little valley to their H.Q. to
“take over.” I can imagine their Officers watching me come along, and
wondering what sort of a “blighter” they were getting this time. Well,
my feelings were much the same, but I had learned from the Brigadier
some of their good points, and they did not know even my bad ones then,
so I started “one up” on them anyhow.

I took over from Acting-Captain Hermelin, who was then in command;
Besch was the Intelligence Officer; Morris, Signalling Officer; Nelson,
the “Doc.”; Hewitt, Acting Adjutant; Light, Quarter-Master; Prentice,
Transport Officer; Robinson, Padre; and Wyler our Interpreter.

Very early a batch of officer-reinforcements arrived, and it became
obvious we were in for a show the nature of which we could only guess,
but for my part I should like to say that from the very first I had
every help from Officers, N.C.O.’s and men, and my work was made easy
by the spirit they all showed of welcoming me as one of themselves from
the start. I shall never forget those first few days and the solid
foundation of trust and comradeship they laid for what was before us.

       *       *       *       *       *

On the 26th September we left our Camp for the old trenches just
outside Queant, where we were to assemble prior to a march on to our
“tape” between Moeuvre and Inchy, and we knew when we left (having
received all the barrage tables, etc.) that we were in for one of
the biggest battles fought by the British Armies during the whole of
the War, as the Division had to cross the Canal du Nord and take the
Hindenburg Line in conjunction with the Canadians on our left, and the
Guards on our right. This was only to be the first phase, and as far
as the Naval Division was concerned, the 190th Brigade was the first
to kick off. Afterwards, the other Brigades were to go through us and
capture Anneux and get on as far as they could.

I was rather pleased to find that it fell to the Artists to do the
lion’s share of the work of our Brigade, i.e., we had to capture the
Hindenburg Line after the Fusiliers and the Bedfords had crossed the
Canal, a very delicate and involved movement which required a great
deal of preparation and explanation.

We arrived at our Assembly Point without trouble and at midnight
started off--a pitch black night, in a deluge of rain. We made very
slow progress; it was a difficult job keeping in touch and following
the line, which was marked out by whitewashed posts, most of which
had either been knocked down by the Artillery, or obliterated by
the rain. Without Hewitt and Goacher we should have found it very
difficult indeed, and might easily have had the same misfortune as was
experienced by another Battalion who missed the track somewhere outside
Pronville and got too much to the left. But these two officers did
splendidly and we eventually arrived at a trench which marked our then
front line. I halted the Battalion and they laid down and soon went to
sleep. We waited about, hoping against hope that the other troops would
arrive, but finally gave up all expectation of seeing them and got the
Battalion out into shell holes slightly in advance of our previous
position.

Seeing that the situation was exceedingly vague, I decided to put every
available man on the line, and issued orders to the Company Commanders
telling them that unless the missing Battalion turned up, we should
have to tackle their job as well as our own on our immediate front, and
that in the advance up the Hindenburg Line we would take half their
objective, and the Canadians would look after the other half.

About 4.30 a.m. everything was ready as far as we could foresee, and
there was nothing further to be done then but wait, and what a long
time the last half hour before zero seems! However the time arrived at
last and so did the Boche attempt at retaliation. It seemed to come
down on our trench for some reason or other, and soon the doctors were
very busy, and after what seemed an age Morris arrived back to say that
all was going well, that the Battalion was in the Canal taking a lot of
prisoners, that our barrage was as near perfection as anything he had
ever dreamed of, and that the Boche barrage was falling well behind our
men--all of which was good news. With my H.Q. and runners I started off
at once.

What a change from the night before! It was a lovely morning, and once
out in the open, going towards the Canal, it was a wonderful sight to
see our barrage and the men following it up. I cannot describe the
feeling I had watching the Artists in action--to me the first time.
From behind it looked as near drill-perfect as you could wish for. We
were not long in getting across the Canal, where we saw one of our
tanks stuck, and met many wounded coming back, amongst them being
Fergus Young, who was supported by a Boche prisoner about twice his
size. He was very worried about his Company, though as it turned out he
had no need to be--they were carrying on all right, away on in front.
As we got nearer the front line things seemed to get very busy. There
were crowds of prisoners coming down--batches of 200 at a time in
charge of one or two men--all their officers wanting to go down into
dug-outs to collect their belongings, but I do not suppose they found
many, because the ground was literally on fire, and after walking a
short distance between the Hindenburg Line one’s feet were quite hot
from the heat of the earth. Soon messages began to come back--that the
first objective had been taken--then the barrage moved on again, so
did our men, and our messages came fast--“Cannot get on for machine
gun fire;” “No sign of the Bedfords on the right flank,” and with like
messages from the left.

It then appeared that things were sticking a bit, so we pushed on
up to see what really was happening, and found things pretty well
mixed up--our men short of bombs, having used everything they had and
everyone doing his level best. We discovered that both our flanks were
well in the air, and getting forward was out of the question until
matters righted themselves on the flanks. By this time we had lost
the barrage for our second objective, and it had become a question of
holding on to what we had until the position cleared up. Being shot at
from three sides is never a very pleasant experience but the men stuck
it out wonderfully. I saw that we should need every single available
man to hold on, so I went down the line a bit to collect any oddments I
could find. It is surprising the number one comes across in a big show
like this. There were Bedfords and Fusiliers who were beginning to come
along in large batches. They were all gathered into parties and sent
up straight away. The Fusiliers had had a pretty rough time trekking
about all night, and had just arrived in time to go over with the
Canadians, where they were soon doing their share “good and hard” as
the Brigadier, who had spent his time cheering up the men, would say. I
found the Signallers fixing up communications to the Companies and we
got news of the poor Bedfords too who had had a very rough crossing,
but had come through all right. We knew then that our right flank was
in touch though it was thrown back very considerably, and we seemed to
catch the whole attention of the Boche.

Presently orders came through that the attack preceded by heavy barrage
on one or two selected places--a sugar factory on the Bapaume-Cambrai
Road being one--would be resumed at 2.15.

Everything up the line was as good as we could hope for, and the 188th
Brigade was getting ready to carry on. They were to go through us, and
on to Anneux and as much further as they could get. We then returned to
Brigade H.Q. where we found Prentice and his transport--all safe and
sound, and rather surprised to be so near the battle. Thoughts of hot
food for the men seemed to be within the range of possibility provided
the resumed attack went off all right. I saw the Brigadier again, told
him that we were all ready for our original third objective, but he
said we need not move at all, as the 188th were going through us, where
we were, to their objective. The rest had been cut out and was being
dealt with by the Artillery alone, so I went back post-haste, but was
not in time to stop many men getting on, especially those at the front,
who had numerous scores to pay off by this time.

The 2.15 show was a complete success, so much so, that the 188th were
able to move right up to Anneux without any trouble: then they bumped
into plenty, I believe, but that is outside the story of the Artists.
Shortly afterwards the Divisional General came round our line, thanking
the men for the splendid victory, and still more for the magnificent
resistance they had made when checked. I had been told beforehand that
if we got the crest of the hill--which was our first objective--and
stuck to it, we should have won the day whatever happened. As it was
we got beyond and held on, against Machine-Gun fire, Trench Mortars,
and Bombing, for hours, until the whole situation cleared all along the
line; a hard enough test for any troops and an achievement in itself
that would have made any Battalion’s reputation.

Late in the evening we got orders to spend the night on our battle
positions. Besch and I took a look round the places where we had been
held up earlier in the day and in every case there was no lack of
evidence of the supreme courage of our men. Before settling down we
buried all our dead: there seemed to us to be a lot, but in comparison
to the total casualties of the day, and in relation to the value of the
work accomplished, there were really few. So ended one of the greatest
days in this War and my first experience of the Artists in action. I,
for one, shall never forget the 27th September, 1918, and I can only
pray to be forgiven if I in any way failed them during that day, or
subsequently: they never failed me once.[14]

There were one or two incidents in the battle which are, perhaps,
worth noting. One was the wonderful view we got from our first
objective--how we could see right across the Bapaume-Cambrai Road
the Germans directing their fire, both field and machine-guns, and
watching the battle. From one of the forward posts we actually saw the
officer-in-charge and one of the guns knocked out, and we could see the
Guards trying to get forward and being held up, as we were.

As a matter of interest in training, I found in a large square hole
(which had probably been intended for a concrete shelter) Capt. Hall
with several men, including a Lewis Gun team. It was a very warm
corner, and there he was directing the fire of his men and the Lewis
Gun team as if he was carrying out a Range Practice in the most
approved Hythe manner. It is a point which is so apt to be forgotten
in training, that if your instruction has been good, you will
unconsciously do the right thing in a tight corner. The mere fact of
real good fire-orders at such a time had a most wonderfully steadying
effect.

What struck me largely about the Boche prisoners was that they did
not seem to be a bit sorry to be captured, that they worked well and
hard in helping the wounded, and that a large number of them spoke
English very well. Our attack along the Hindenburg Line in a southerly
direction must have been an entire surprise to the enemy, as we found
their machine-guns were mounted facing west, and that when our attack
down the line developed from the north they had had to dismantle all
their guns.

I think that a large portion of our success should be attributed to
the Artillery; the barrage was marvellous, especially the swing to
enable us to change our direction. This took 79 minutes, and it was not
particularly pleasant for us to wait the time, but it obviously fooled
the Boche.

Another thing which came to our help that day (which has rarely
happened in connection with the English) was that the wind and the
weather were perfect for us, and as for our smoke barrages, the smoke
went just where it should have gone. But by far and away the greatest
satisfaction to me was to know that whatever happened afterwards,
I could depend absolutely upon the Battalion in every conceivable
circumstance. To take a new Battalion into an action of that size,
without ever having been in the line at all with them before, is a very
anxious job.

    _The Artists were detailed to follow the front-line troops and
       then swing with the Artillery on to the Hindenburg Line._

Next morning (28th) we were on the move again and reached the sugar
factory on the Bapaume-Cambrai Road. There we waited until the
afternoon--had a sleep and were off again via Graincourt to Cantaing.
This was well behind the Boche lines, and we were going towards the
Canal de l’Escaut, which was obviously the next obstacle that was
before us. We halted rather to the north-west of the village and dug
in. We were not troubled very much during the night. We could quite
easily see the towers of the town of Cambrai, and watched some large
fires which the Germans had started there.

Early in the morning (29th) I went round the lines--if you could call
them such. It was most encouraging to find the men so cheerful after
what they had been through, a testament of their excellent training,
and of the wonderful esprit de corps which I always found with the
Artists, and it was no joke camping out in a beastly little hole
all night long. It was very cold indeed and there were no nice Army
blankets to help matters. Still, they were Artists--and they were
winning--so what did it matter?

We were not wanted that morning and made the most of it, whilst the
other Brigades had the pleasure of forcing a crossing over the Canal.
It was Naval Division against Naval Division that day, so our fellows
were all out for it, somewhat enlivened by the success on the 27th.
From where we were it did not sound a big show when it started, but one
could see we were not getting things without paying the price. Many
good fellows were coming back, some badly wounded to a Dressing Station
near our Headquarters and lots of prisoners.

Later in the day we moved up to the east of Cantaing and had just got
nicely settled down hoping to get a decent night’s rest when we got
orders to cross the Canal de l’Escaut and form up on a road running
south from Cambrai near a farm called La Marliere. So off we went
cursing the old Boche and the War in general through some gun positions
round to a place where a pontoon bridge had been thrown across the
Canal. It was a very noisy journey as far as the Canal, and then the
fun began. As usual it started to rain--real rain--and it was as black
as ink as we plodded along. After a good deal of trekking about we
found our road well to the right of the place where we should have hit
it--so far so good. We had to put up with a ditch where there were far
more machine-gun bullets flying about than was exactly pleasant and had
just settled down to sleep when I was sent for by Brigade, and learned
there was a ‘show’ hatching. We were to attack at 5.30 in the morning,
and were given three objectives. Our attack was roughly due east, and
the final objective was a place called Niergnies. The difficulty in the
show was the barrage arrangements. No guns up to then had been brought
across the Canal, and Niergnies was 5,000 yards away from the nearest
gun, also they were in low country, and angles for shooting all wrong.
Anyway we were to go on and push the Boche back, and the second Corps
on our right was to co-operate with us.

About 1.30 a.m. (Sept. 30th) all was settled so far as we could arrange
it, and the horrible time of waiting started, we trying to sleep. Zero
arrived, our men started off and I sent Hewitt and a few runners on to
select a new H.Q. just to the rear of our first objective. Presently
one of them came back with the information that the party had arrived
all right, having gone through very heavy machine gun fire. He also
stated that there was no sign of the Battalion, that it was a very bad
place and that one of Hewitt’s men had been hit. We did not like this
news, so we went to find out what had happened. It soon became only too
evident that the attack was held up, and we had not even been able to
reach our first objective. I made my way up to the Battalion who were
digging-in under very heavy machine gun fire, about 300 yards east of
the road and found they could not get any further forward; they were in
some sort of line in the open and in a trench, but in a poor position,
under machine-gun fire all the time and it was a case of sitting tight
again. Meanwhile, our right flank was thrown back a bit, and the Second
Corps Troops who ought to have gone over with us came up but were quite
unable to push forward.

An anxious morning passed somehow, and then we got orders to resume
the attack--in other words, to try again. We tried but only to fail.
This meant a lot of reorganising for the Company Commanders, and a
tremendous extra strain on the men, but they stuck it and we had to
stay where we were.

A long night came to an end and presently to my relief Hewitt turned
up. Afterwards we got his story out of him. The poor fellow who had
been hit had died, and they had to bury him as best they could. If they
showed their heads above the top they were at once shot at. Hewitt had
sent no further messages back as it was too risky, and he decided to
wait until dark and then get back as best he could. He did so, and luck
was with him--they found their way eventually to our present place.
They had had a dreadful time, and a really terrible experience, but
like all good soldiers, they hated to talk about it, so we left it at
that.


                            OCTOBER, 1918.

In the evening (Oct. 1st) the Division was relieved and we went back
again to the west of Cantaing into trenches with improvised shelters.
The next day or two we spent in reorganising, quite a difficult job as
we were very weak, and cleaning up.

We now felt fairly certain that we were going out for a rest, as we
had had a pretty stiff time since the 26th and had lost a lot of very
fine fellows, mostly wounded, thank goodness. We needed a rest, and
felt somehow that we had earned it, but on October 6th a message came
before breakfast that we were to have another go for Niergnies, this
time jumping off from Rumilly. It was to be an “in-and-out show,” just
a day’s hard fighting and then out again, and if we were successful it
would ensure the fall of Cambrai.

Our reconnaissances and plans having been made we moved (7th) to
Noyelles, and so to a field where we tried to sleep a bit, to the
accompaniment of a neighbouring 6-inch naval gun, and crossed the canal
after dark and slowly made our way to our assembling place.

Soon the show started and we found that a sunken road, where our H.Q.
dug-out was, came in for considerable attention from the Boche. Quite a
lot of people were wounded just outside, my signalling officer (Bayne)
amongst them.[15] Then the two Intelligence Officers--my own (Besch)
and the Bedfords--went to find us a new H.Q. The latter was hit before
he got across the road, Besch escaped and got on all right. Soon all
the rest of us followed. The shelling did not seem to be so bad when
we got out--it never does--dug-outs are beastly, and things sound much
worse in them than they are. It was nice to be out and following up
the Battalion, of which we could see nothing at first, but we soon got
up to them, found they had managed to keep together, and were in good
order and busy digging in. Things seemed to be going very well. “A”
Co. were very pleased with themselves, as they got 105 prisoners and 12
machine guns in one trench on the way. Soon there was unusual activity
up at the front, and one of our tanks came back chased by a 5.9 all the
way. It was a wonderful sight, and rather funny, but poor sport for the
men in the tank. It was extraordinary how near the shells fell round it
and yet never once hit it, and I heard afterwards that it got home.

We were conscious of a lot of extra firing, and a number of little
shells which seemed to come very low. All at once I saw the line to
our south begin to move back--this gave one a very uncomfortable
feeling, to say the least of it. We heard that the Germans were
counter-attacking with tanks--so I went forward, and found that the
Commanding Officer of the Battalion in front of us had gone to retrieve
the position, and could quite easily see the German Tanks--which really
were our own captured in November, 1917 (or even later during the
retreat in 1918) and were equipped with German and Belgian Guns. The
nearest one to us was burning away, as it had been hit and set on fire.
Another one we were firing at from a Boche anti-tank gun. In passing,
it is interesting to note that out of five (possibly seven) tanks
that attacked us, two were knocked out by German weapons we captured
that day: one by a Boche anti-tank gun and the other by one of their
anti-tank rifles. The other tanks, seeing the fate of two of their
companions and that the Boche infantry did not support them, decided
it was wiser to go back where they came from. It was really quite an
exciting hour until the situation became normal again.

Nothing more happened for a bit. The situation seemed vague on the
left flank and in the village of Niergnies, so I sent up an officer
(McKinley) to make a reconnaissance for the Brigade, which he did,
and telephoned the result back, and later went up again just to make
certain that everything was still. The information he got was of the
greatest assistance to the Brigade, and the reconnaissance was very
well done indeed.[16]

Shortly before dusk we were warned that a counter-attack was
expected on our left flank, and I was told that should it assume
a serious nature, the Artists would be required to carry out the
counter-counter-attack and restore the position. However, it was no
good looking for trouble before it came, so we just kept a special
look-out on this flank, and moved a few more Lewis Guns there in case
anything occurred. Nothing happened, and later in the evening I heard
we were to be relieved by a Battalion who we could see coming up. It
seemed an interminable time before we got the word to go home. We were
all ready for it, watching the valley behind us, which was receiving
continuous attention from the Boche who was using gas and H.E., mixed
with instantaneous fuses, very freely, and when we finally got the
order to go the gassing was really quite bad. Between where we were
and Rumilly, it was a sort of nightmare going back. We had to use our
gas-masks and fortunately all got through safely to our billets outside
Cantaing. The attack had been a great success and a surprise for the
Boche--Cambrai fell the next day, as a direct result of our work. To
show how we had suffered, and to what small units we had descended, it
is interesting to note that the Battalion which relieved us, relieved
the whole of the Division. It was a strong Battalion of over 800, but
all the same it is not often that a Battalion can relieve a Division.

This time we were fairly certain to be taken out of the line, for the
obvious reason that we were no longer a real fighting force. We had
been at it since the 26th September, and had suffered very heavily. The
Division soon got orders to go North out of the 3rd Army into the 1st,
in places round St. Pol where we were to refit, get our drafts, train
hard, and get back as soon as possible, as it was now Division against
Division, and no one could be spared out of the line for long.

We were soon on our way by stages via Vaulx-Vraucourt to Brias where
we settled down to the work of reorganising. We were a small Battalion
now, but a very cheerful one. We started giving each other dinners,
and on the night the Brigadier dined with us Croft reported to the
Battalion.

One dinner which I shall not forget was the fourth anniversary
(Oct. 28th) of the Artists coming out to France, when all those who
were left, amounting I think to 26, met at a little estaminet in
Avesnes-le-Comte. I took it as a great compliment to be the only guest
asked.

These good times soon come to an end. After various alarms and
excursions, we finally marched off and embussed, our destination being
a place called Le Forest, just outside Douai. It was rather a wonderful
ride, and a lovely day. We went via Lens, which was a pitiable sight.
I do not think I have ever seen any place of its size so completely
and deliberately destroyed. There were a lot of refugees coming back,
both east and west, carrying their worldly belongings with them. There
was no possibility of anyone finding anything habitable when they got
to Lens. One family struck me as a particularly bad case, even amongst
so many. They had come goodness knows how far, and consisted of an old
man, his wife, their daughter, and son-in-law, and their child in a
tumbled down old perambulator, piled up with all kinds of other things.
They had just arrived, and were standing on a heap of bricks, which
they realized was the site of their old home. I shall never forget the
look of utter desolation on their faces--they were beyond crying. There
must have been many, many cases like this, and they would all either
have to settle there, or face the journey back from where they had
come, a case of 7 or 8 miles at the least, on roads that only bore the
name out of courtesy. I saw some of our men crying when they saw these
people. There is something about a Frenchman’s love of his home that
appeals to us. With dog-like faith they tramp for miles to start all
over again in a place rendered more than desolate, which seems to me
the highest form of patriotism imaginable.

At Henin-Lietard we had to get out, as the bridges across the Canal
were blown up, and trekked to Le Forest. The Artists got an old Boche
hospital and after the usual spring clean was not too bad a home.
Headquarter Mess was in a nice little house in the main Street--at
least the bottom part of it was nice, the staircase having been burnt
out, and the upstairs rooms were rather a muddle. Here we gave a
concert and some conjuring exhibitions to the inhabitants, who hardly
seemed to realise that they were actually free and allowed to do more
or less as they liked. Some rumours of moves began to come along,
and we realised that it would not be very long before we were off
again--this time to some purpose.


              NOVEMBER, 1918: THE LAST PHASE OF THE WAR.

On November 5th our rest at Le Forest came to an end and we journeyed
back via Auby and Douai to Thiant. The next morning we marched on to
Saultain, movement being slow owing to the congestion on the roads and
their state, and we got completely blocked up in a village (Aulnoy)
which showed signs of recent fighting, a good many dead lying about
outside.

On the 7th we were off again to Sebourquiaux. By this time the Brigade
that we were following were in action, and we were moving up in
readiness to go through it when ordered, and that evening reached Angré.

Early the next day (8th) we reached Audregnies, where we went through
the other Brigade, and had three objectives assigned, but it was
obviously impossible that we should accomplish them in the time that
was left to us in the day. Near Wiheries there was a fair amount
of indiscriminate shelling on forward slopes and we lost some men.
However, we moved on in artillery formation, keeping pretty well closed
up and halted in the outskirts of Blaugies where we managed to get on
the line of our first objective without further trouble and had to pass
the night there as we could not overcome the Boche machine-gun fire.

November 9th was a day which I do not think any Artists who were then
with us are ever likely to forget. We advanced in all 15,000 yards, as
the crow flies, which of course meant considerably more trekking, and
a good bit had to be done through woods and across country. We started
off something like a triumphal procession, as we were the first English
troops to enter Blaugies, and we were met by the inhabitants, who
rushed out and kissed us, old and young alike, and offered us coffee,
liqueurs, and anything they could lay their hands on. It was really
pathetically sad, and yet very funny, and it was with difficulty one
refrained from crying, by the necessity of laughing.

Passing through Blaugies, we ran into our own barrage, which eventually
I got stopped, as it was falling amongst the cavalry and was holding
up our advance. From that moment we were not bothered with any more
barrages, the artillery being attached to us, which is really far
the most sensible way in going through open country, as we were. It
gives one the means of visible retaliation, which is always lacking
when dependent entirely on artillery behind you, whose doings, except
barrage work you know nothing about. We next had to go through the Wood
of Sars-la-Bruyere and on to the village of the same name, where again
we were welcomed by the inhabitants in like manner. I was presented
with a large bouquet of flowers, tied up with Belgian ribbon and had
to walk through the village carrying the beastly thing. The centre of
this village had been our last objective, and we had no sooner got
through than we had orders to move on again to a railway embankment
on the other side of the wood to the east of Sars-la-Bruyere. Further
orders came extending this objective right up to the Mons-Maubeuge
Road in front of Quevy-le-Petit, so we packed up once more and started
off. Then taking two runners with me, I started off straight through
the wood, arrived in the village before the Battalion and took up my
H.Q. in the Burgomaster’s house, which had only been left a few hours
earlier by a General of the German Army, who had stopped to watch our
advance and then gone off in a motor car. At last the Battalion was in
possession of their objective and settled down for a few hours rest.

The next morning (10th) I got orders to ‘side-slip’ to the north,
take up a position on the Mons-Maubeuge Road to the west of the
village of Harvengt and support the Fusiliers and Bedfords. This was
the first time that the Artists had been in support to either of the
other Battalions since coming north from the Cambrai Sector, but it
only lasted half a day. I met my Company Commanders at a Chateau on
the Mons-Maubeuge Road, just below a bridge, which the Germans had
blown up. We had a short conference in a delightful room placed at our
disposal by the owner of the Chateau, then marched on up the road and
we were in our place almost as soon as the cavalry had gone out.

I noticed going up the road that there was a Boche Observation Balloon
up--the last one we saw during the War--and the only one which had
been visible since our start on the 5th. Unfortunately, it saw the
other Brigade, which was coming up to go through us, and this drew a
considerable amount of fire round our H.Q. in the village of Asquillies.

Just after they had gone, I got the news by runner, that poor old Croft
had been killed. It is no use trying to tell you what that meant to the
Battalion, or to me personally. He had not been back with us very long
after a prolonged absence, and I know he felt like coming home when he
rejoined us at Brias. He was always like a ray of sunshine if there was
anything doing. With him were two other good fellows, 2/Lt. King and
Sergt. Garbutt; also a Lancer with whom they were talking at the time;
a stray shell fell in the sunken road and killed all four of them.

We were anxiously expecting rations and orders to return to Asquillies
for the rest we were all wanting, but were sent forward to Harvengt
where there seemed to be a good deal of confusion, so I halted the
Battalion and had a look round. I found from the 56th Division who were
there that they had been held up just outside the village by heavy
machine gun fire and that it would be quite impossible to go forward
that night. Eventually it was arranged that the Artists should relieve
the 1st London and we moved forward again as far as we could get.

November 11th. At daybreak I started off up the line, having received
information that the Battalion had commenced to move and that the Boche
had ‘hooked it.’ Reaching Harmignies, I found that our men had been in
within less than half an hour after the departure of the Germans, and
our patrols reported that at two of the villages in front there were no
signs of the enemy. We had orders to take up our position and remain at
Harmignies, and that the 188th Brigade would go through us early in the
morning. I went round, saw everybody and waited until the other Brigade
had started to move forward and then set off to return. On my way back
I met a whole lot of the Lancers, all formed up ready to go through. It
was a fine sight seeing them all on their horses anxious to be off. On
getting back I was met by a Doctor who said that he owed me some money
(he had made a bet with me; that there would be no armistice or peace
this year). For a moment I could not quite make out what he meant,
until I noticed that everybody seemed pleased and then I learned the
news of the Armistice which had come through a few minutes previously.
I saw the Brigadier, got confirmation of the Armistice news, sent it up
to the Companies, scrounged round making arrangements for baths for the
men, got them all back again, and they had their baths and went to bed.

In the afternoon the Band arrived, after a somewhat chequered journey
from England, very sorry for themselves. Also British prisoners, who
had been left behind by the enemy, began to trickle through; they were
in a most pitiable state. And so came the Armistice to the Artists--in
the line to the very last. It will always be a satisfaction to us when
we come to look back upon things that we were there when the end came
and that the efforts of our Division contributed in no small degree to
the final collapse of the Boche.


                         AFTER THE ARMISTICE.

Of course we could hardly realise things at first and there was still
an awful lot to do. The silence seemed almost uncanny at times.

I do not know if I can describe the funeral of Ben Croft, King and
Garbutt, but of course it was the first thing we did. As they were
killed just outside the village, we decided to bury them at the side of
the road where they fell, with such Military Honours as we could, their
own Company finding the firing party, and the buglers sounded the Last
Post. It was a sad little party that gathered round the graves of the
last Artists to fall in action. A large number of Officers and men came
and the Brigadier found time to be present. I think these three were
the last casualties of the War in our Brigade. It seemed so very hard,
that it was only a matter of 24 hours, and all would have been well.
The inhabitants of the village had given us some oak to make a cross
from and someone else thought of flowers-and after doing all we could
we returned to our billets.

We soon heard stories of going on to the Rhine and were selected for
this, but owing to the heavy fighting, and our additional wastage
through sickness, our strength was so far short that finally it was
decided we should not go. So we had to accept the hard fact and see
another Division put in our place. At the time we were generally
disappointed, but on looking back now I think it was just as well, and
possibly most Artists will agree.

On the 15th, a cold, clear November day, we took part in the official
entry of the First Army into Mons, lined the street, and after hours
of waiting marched past the Army Commander in the square. We did not
exactly enjoy it, but now that distance is lending its enchantment we
can regard it as a thing to have done.

Soon we got permission to move back to Harmignies to better billets,
thence to Athis, where we started Education Classes and a Debating
Society. We also had to practice for a Review by the First Army
Commander, had two full-dress rehearsals, and then the show was put
off, but I suppose a little ceremonial drill did not do any of us much
harm; anyway it provided a certain amount of amusement. Next we were
moved back to Blaugies where we were not long in getting ready for our
Christmas plans. We decided to have Company dinners, three in one day
was the maximum reached, and we came safely through the lot. It was
really a great Christmas taking it all round. There was not one of us
who did not want to be home for it, but as we could not, we put our
backs into it, and made the most of it under the circumstances, and
now it is all over I do not think one of us regrets having spent it in
Blaugies.

All this time we were slowly getting smaller, and one day were sent to
our final destination, St. Ghislain. It was an eye-opener for the men
when they arrived there--almost like going home, without the home--real
beds and sheets for every man, it must have been the first bed that
most of them had seen for many, many months.

I soon found that the men preferred their own time to organised
amusements, which so long as all went well was really much better for
them, and I am more than glad to know that it did go well. It was a
very good change for them to get into some sort of civilisation, and
demobilisation started quicker when we got to St. Ghislain.

One day I got special leave, as I had been applied for at this end.
I do not know exactly how to describe what I felt: I knew that this
special leave was tantamount to saying “Farewell” to the Artists.
However, it was unavoidable and would have had to come sooner or later,
and perhaps it was as well that it was hurried a bit at the end. I got
all packed up, and then went on to the Mess, where I found some villain
had collected most of the Battalion to see me off. I think it takes
nearly as much courage to go round and say “Good-bye” to people as it
does to go over the top.

Soon after this I went down for the first time to the Artists
Headquarters in Duke’s Road, where I met a lot of people whom I had
often heard of, but never before seen. They one and all made me so
welcome, that I almost felt I was going to my own home. I shall never
forget Colonel May coming up to me, and saying that he would like to
thank me for all I had done for the Artists, but that he did not quite
know how to do so, so he thought perhaps he had better repeat to me
what one of the men had said to him. When asked something about their
new Commanding Officer, this man had replied, “Well, Sir, he might have
been an Artist himself.”

I think that if I have earned those words, honestly spoken, it is as
much as anyone could have wished.

                                                           R. H. G.

   P.S.--I have said very little about the organisation and
   interior working of the Battalion because I do not consider
   it would be a compliment to go into such details. I think the
   secret of the Artists’ success was very largely the wonderful
   amount of material always at hand. When Adjutants, Scouts,
   Signallers, Runners, Pioneers, and all these people were ever
   ready, and there was always somebody fit to step into someone
   else’s shoes if anything happened, it really was very easy work
   for a stranger, once he realised this. Then there was old Freddy
   Light, with his 40 years service in the Corps, and R.Q.M.S.
   Hack, a veteran of the Boer War times. They always worked
   quietly without any fuss or bother, always had what was wanted,
   and would have done anything in the world which was humanly
   possible, that the men should be comfortable, and that the
   Battalion should always have the best of everything. There were
   few Territorial Regiments who had the services of one of their
   own Quarter-Masters, and the Artists have been extremely lucky
   in theirs.

   Then you will find in my notes that the names of the Officers
   are nearly always the same. I have avoided using names at
   all except where I thought it would simplify matters, but I
   do not wish to convey the impression that these are the only
   names worthy of note, as it is not so. I should not know where
   to begin, or end, if I had to tell you what I thought about
   individuals. I see that R.S.M. Fox is not mentioned--there
   again we were singularly fortunate, and had to do a great deal
   of “wangling” to keep him. As you know, any man who occupied
   that position after Peter Emslie had gone, had a very tough
   proposition before him.

CLARK, Capt. Philip Lindsay                            11/Royal Sussex

   E. of YPRES, 25th to 27th October, 1917. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty when in command of the left flank
   company of the battalion. When the enemy broke through on his
   left he organised a defensive flank. Finding a gap on his left
   he filled and held it with some of his own men and of the unit
   on his left. He personally led a charge against the advancing
   enemy and dispersed them, and later repelled another attack.
   He was wounded by a piece of shrapnel in the head, but though
   dazed, continued in command of his company for two days until
   relieved.

FAGAN, Capt. Herbert Archer, _M.C. (bar)_    9/Gurkha Rifles
                                             (late 5/Yorkshire)

   In SOUTH RUSSIA. For conspicuous gallantry and determination
   on several occasions, particularly at Sorarogha, on the 18th
   January, and at Makin, on the 19th February, 1920. In the first
   instance he was in charge of a company ordered to establish
   a piquet in a position which was much exposed and commanded
   by fire. He set a fine example in beating off attacks and in
   attempting to establish the piquet. Subsequently he withdrew his
   company with great skill. In the second instance he again showed
   gallantry and leadership when troops on the left were ordered to
   withdraw.

    [3635

FIELD, 2/Lt. Edward                               Machine Gun Corps

   ROUPY, near ST. QUENTIN, 21st March, 1918. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty when in charge of a section of
   guns during repeated enemy attacks. For eight hours he fired his
   guns with great judgment under heavy machine-gun and artillery
   fire. The enemy poured out of a valley in large numbers, and
   the guns fired with terrific effect. The enemy was held for
   seven hours. Then, reinforced, they advanced to within 100 yards
   of the guns and bombed the positions from the right rear. He
   ordered his guns to cut their way to new positions while he
   helped their retirement by throwing the remainder of the bombs.
   In getting back he was shot through the body. His determination
   and fearlessness were magnetic. Throughout the day he fought
   magnificently.

    [763848

JOHNSON, Lt.-Col. Francis Shand Byam       R. of O., Royal Lancaster
                                            (1/Artists)

   POZIERES RIDGE, 24th March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. When his battalion became isolated during an
   enemy attack and both flanks were exposed, by his courage and
   skill he succeeded in withdrawing his battalion without serious
   loss. The successful withdrawal was entirely due to his splendid
   leadership and determination.

ASTBURY, 2/Lt. Alec              R.F.A. (D/286 Brigade, R.F.A. (T.F.)

   Near BOYELLES, 22nd August, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. He brought his battery into action under
   very heavy fire, and got his ammunition wagons up to the
   battery position in spite of congested traffic. Later, he was
   instrumental in laying telephone wires from a very advanced
   post to the battery over open country under heavy machine-gun
   fire. The information which he sent back was of great value in
   enabling the enemy line to be driven back.

    [765207

 HEY, 2/Lt. Percy                                              R.G.A.

   Near VILLERS BRETONNEUX, 7th August, 1918. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty. When a number of tanks filled
   with bombs and explosives close to his battery position had
   been set alight by enemy shell fire, he led a small party and
   successfully extinguished the burning camouflage covering his
   own and neighbouring guns, and dragged into safety all exposed
   cartridges. His determined courage saved the loss of ammunition
   and stores.

    [765448

RICHARD, 2/Lt. Stanley                              Machine Gun Corps

   Near LES RUES VERTES, 3rd December, 1917. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty. During an enemy attack, and
   whilst under intense artillery fire, he performed magnificent
   work, keeping his guns in action, being with one gun himself in
   an exposed position until gun and team were blown up. Being the
   only one remaining unwounded, on his own initiative he moved up
   to his other three guns, which he continued to keep in action
   and supplied with ammunition, until these also were put out of
   action and he was wounded. Throughout he set a fine example of
   courage, and was of great assistance in checking the hostile
   attack.

HALLOWES, 2/Lt. Rupert Price, _M.C._                       4/Middlesex

   HOOGE, BELGIUM, between 25th September and 1st October, 1915.
   For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty.

   2/Lt. Hallowes displayed throughout these days the greatest
   bravery and untiring energy, and set a magnificent example
   to his men during four heavy and prolonged bombardments. On
   more than one occasion he climbed up on the parapet, utterly
   regardless of danger, in order to put fresh heart into his men.
   He made daring reconnaissances of the German positions in our
   lines. When the supply of bombs was running short he went back
   under heavy shell fire and brought up a fresh supply. Even after
   he was mortally wounded he continued to cheer those around him,
   and to inspire them with fresh courage.

FLEMING-SANDES, 2/Lt. Arthur James Terence               2/East Surrey

   HOHENZOLLERN REDOUBT, FRANCE, September 29th, 1915. For
   most conspicuous bravery.

   2/Lt. Fleming-Sandes was sent to command a company which at
   the time was in a very critical position. The troops on his
   right were retiring, and his own men, who were much shaken by
   continual bombing and machine-gun fire, were also beginning to
   retire, owing to shortage of bombs. Taking in the situation at
   a glance, he collected a few bombs, jumped on to the parapet in
   full view of the Germans, who were only twenty yards away, and
   threw them.

   Although very severely wounded almost at once by a bomb, he
   struggled to his feet and continued to advance and throw bombs
   till he was again severely wounded. This most gallant act put
   new heart into his men, rallied them, and saved the situation.

MELLISH, Capt. the Rev. Edward Noel   Chaplain to the Forces (R.A.C.D.)

   ST. ELOI, FRANCE, 27th to 29th March, 1916. For most conspicuous
   bravery.

   During heavy fighting on three consecutive days he repeatedly
   went backwards and forwards under continuous and heavy shell
   and machine-gun fire, between our original trenches and those
   captured from the enemy, in order to tend and rescue wounded
   men. He brought in ten badly wounded men on the first day from
   ground swept by machine-gun fire and three were actually killed
   while he was dressing their wounds. The battalion to which he
   was attached was relieved on the second day, but he went back
   and brought in twelve more wounded men. On the night of the
   third day he took charge of a party of volunteers, and once more
   returned to the trenches to rescue the remaining wounded. This
   splendid work was quite voluntary on his part, and outside the
   scope of his ordinary duties.

CATHER, Lieut. Geoffrey St. George Shillington
                                      Adjutant 9/Royal Irish Fusiliers

   NEAR HAMEL, FRANCE, 1st July, 1916. For most conspicuous
   bravery.

   From 7 p.m. till midnight he searched “No Man’s Land,” and
   brought in three wounded men. Next morning at 8 a.m. he
   continued his search, brought in another wounded man, and gave
   water to others, arranging for their rescue later. Finally, at
   10.30 a.m., he took out water to another man and was proceeding
   further on when he was himself killed. All this was carried out
   in full view of the enemy, and under direct machine-gun fire
   and intermittent artillery fire. He set a splendid example of
   courage and self-sacrifice.

BENNETT, Lieut. Eugené Paul, _M.C._                        2/Worcester

   Near LE TRANSLOY, FRANCE, 5th November, 1916. For most
   conspicuous bravery in action when in command of the second wave
   of the attack. Finding that the first wave had suffered heavy
   casualties, its commander killed and the line wavering, Lieut.
   Bennett advanced at the head of the second wave, and by his
   personal example of valour and resolution reached his objective
   with but sixty men. Isolated with his small party, he at once
   took steps to consolidate his position under heavy rifle and
   machine-gun fire from both flanks, and, although wounded, he
   remained in command directing and controlling. He set an example
   of cheerfulness and resolution beyond all praise, and there is
   little doubt that but for his personal example of courage the
   attack would have been checked at the outset.

   E. of BOUCHAVESNES, FRANCE, 8th March, 1917. For most
   conspicuous bravery and self-sacrifice. When engaged with some
   other men in deepening a captured trench, this officer struck
   with his spade a buried bomb, which immediately started to burn.
   2/Lt. Cates, in order to save the lives of his comrades, placed
   his foot on the bomb, which immediately exploded. He showed the
   most conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in performing
   the act which cost him his life, but saved the lives of others.

DEAN, Lieut. Donald John                      8/Royal West Kent (T.F.)

   N.W. of LENS, FRANCE, 24th to 26th September, 1918. For most
   conspicuous bravery, skilful command, and devotion to duty when
   holding, with his platoon, an advanced post established in a
   newly-captured enemy trench north-west of Lens. The left flank
   of the position was insecure, and the post, when taken over
   on the night of September 24th, was ill-prepared for defence.
   Shortly after the post was occupied the enemy attempted,
   without success, to recapture it. Under heavy machine-gun fire
   consolidation was continued, and shortly after midnight another
   determined enemy attack was driven off. Throughout the night
   Lieut. Dean worked unceasingly with his men, and about 6 a.m.
   on September 25th a resolute enemy attack, supported by heavy
   shell and trench mortar fire, developed. Again, owing to the
   masterly handling of his command, Lieut. Dean repulsed the
   attack, causing heavy enemy casualties. Throughout the 25th and
   the night of September 25th-26th consolidation was continued
   under heavy fire, which culminated in intense artillery fire on
   the morning of the 26th, when the enemy again attacked and was
   finally repulsed with loss. Five times in all (thrice heavily)
   was this post attacked, and on each occasion the attack was
   driven back. Throughout the period, Lieut. Dean inspired his
   command with his own contempt of danger, and all fought with the
   greatest bravery. He set an example of valour, leadership and
   devotion to duty of the very highest order.

VANN, Lieut.-Col. Bernard William, _M.C. & Bar_; _Croix-de-G._
                                              8(6)Notts & Derby (T.F.)

   BELLENGLISE, FRANCE, 29th September, 1918. For most conspicuous
   bravery, devotion to duty and fine leadership during the attack
   at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt. He led his battalion with great
   skill across the Canal du Nord through a very thick fog and
   under heavy fire from field and machine guns. On reaching the
   high ground above Bellenglise the whole attack was held up
   by fire of all descriptions from the front and right flank.
   Realising that everything depended on the advance going forward
   with the barrage, Lt.-Col. Vann rushed up to the firing line and
   with the greatest gallantry led the line forward. By his prompt
   action and absolute contempt for danger the whole situation was
   changed, the men were encouraged and the line swept forward.
   Later he rushed a field gun single-handed and knocked out three
   of the detachment. The success of the day was in no small degree
   due to the splendid gallantry and fine leadership displayed by
   this officer. Lt.-Col. Vann, who had on all occasions set the
   highest example of valour, was killed near Ramicourt four days
   later, when leading his battalion in attack.

ANDREWS, Capt. Stephen Arthur                           7/Royal Sussex

   Near EPEHY, 18th September, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and good work. His company was allotted the task of clearing
   the railway embankment of the enemy. Although enfiladed by
   machine-gun nests from the village, and having sustained heavy
   casualties, he personally led forward the remainder of his
   company, and was one of very few to reach the objective. He then
   organised under very heavy fire and held the position until the
   situation was cleared up.

BARE, Capt. Alfred Raymond, M.C.            1/2 Loyal North Lancashire

   GIVENCHY, 18th April, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. Under cover of a heavy barrage the enemy
   attacked, very quickly surrounding a strong point, where this
   officer had his company headquarters and one platoon. In face
   of superior numbers he put up a stout resistance until forced
   to retire on to another strong point, where the position was
   very critical, the officer in charge having been killed. He took
   command, and after a stiff fight, drove back the enemy. He was
   twice wounded during the fight.

   FONTAINE-NOTRE-DAME, 27th November, 1917. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty. When part of the advance was
   held up by two enemy machine guns firing from a house he at once
   organised and led a bayonet charge and captured the house and
   its occupants. He then led a successful attack on the second
   objective, and having captured it, beat off a counter-attack.
   Later, when his flank became exposed, and the enemy attacked
   him from the rear, he fought his way back, and brought his men
   out in good order. He set a magnificent example of courage and
   initiative.

EDWARDS, 2/Lt. Cyril George                           7/West Yorkshire

   REINCOURT, 27th July, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. Having gone out with a N.C.O. to reconnoitre
   the enemy’s wire, they were attacked by bombs. The first one
   he seized before it exploded and threw it back, and, when the
   second fell, realising that they could not both escape unharmed,
   he threw his legs over it to smother the explosion, and thus
   protected the N.C.O. By this splendid act of gallantry and
   self-sacrifice he saved the life of his comrade at the risk of
   his own. The N.C.O. was able to drag him back to our lines,
   where he showed great pluck in reporting the information which
   he had gained by his daring reconnaissance.

ELKINGTON, Capt. Christopher Garrett                 8/Gloucestershire

   occasions during a period of three months he has led formations
   on long-distance bombing raids, in which despite bad weather
   conditions, he has found and bombed his objectives with the most
   excellent results. All the operations in which he has taken part
   have proved highly successful, and his capabilities have stood
   out most prominently. He is a keen and most efficient pilot, and
   by his courage and determination has set a splendid example to
   his squadron.

GELSTHORPE, Capt. Alfred Morris            8/Durham L.I. (att. M.G.C.)

S.E. of YPRES, 25th to 28th September, 1917. While he was completing
most elaborate arrangements in an advanced position for a machine-gun
barrage on the following morning, the enemy attacked during the night
under a most intense barrage. He immediately got all his guns into
action with great effect, and made a personal reconnaissance forward to
see if he could use them to better advantage. His teams suffered heavy
casualties during this attack, but he carried out his full barrage
programme on the following morning under a heavy bombardment. He showed
qualities of leadership and initiative of the highest order, and his
example of courage and contempt of danger had the most inspiring
influence on his men.

   conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. When the leading
   companies were held up by machine-gun fire, suffering
   heavy casualties, he went forward collecting personnel and
   reorganising the attack, which resulted in the capture of the
   objective. He showed a fine offensive spirit, which encouraged
   his men at a critical period.

   In ITALY, 27th October, 1918. He was in command of one of the
   leading companies in the attack. He led his men across the Piave
   in a magnificent manner. When the enemy bank had been reached he
   crawled forward and helped to cut a gap in the wire to within 15
   yards of the enemy; all this time he was under observation and
   fire from the embankment, which was still held by the enemy. The
   splendid example he set to his men contributed in a large extent
   to the successful capture of the first objective. Later, in the
   taking of all objectives, he showed himself to be a fine leader
   both in skill and courage. All the houses and strong points were
   tackled under his direction in a systematic and dashing way.

   to duty. Having led his company to their objective, he noticed
   that a farm, some 500 yards ahead, was holding up the attack
   on the left. He at once organised a small party, with which he
   worked round the flank and rushed the farm, capturing three
   machine guns and killing and capturing a number of the enemy.
   By this prompt and plucky action he saved the brigade many
   casualties. His initiative and enterprise in action are at all
   times admirable.

   and devotion to duty in leading a patrol through the enemy
   outposts to a position in the enemy’s main line of resistance,
   which was over 900 yards from our line. His patrol of 20
   captured 23 unwounded prisoners and killed or wounded another
   25 of the enemy. Though the rifles and Lewis gun jammed owing
   to mud, he succeeded in covering the withdrawal of the patrol,
   every man returning safely. He showed magnificent courage and
   resource.

   gallantry and devotion to duty. When his C.O. was wounded
   he took command of the battalion, and handled it with great
   judgment and success. He invariably displayed the utmost courage
   and disregard for personal danger, although frequently exposed
   to heavy machine-gun and rifle fire, and his fine example
   inspired all ranks with him. Ultimately he was wounded.

   Near RIEUX, 10th October, 1918. For great gallantry. When the
   advance met with heavy machine-gun and shell fire, and the
   leading companies had lost many officers, he personally led the
   battalion to its final objective. Again, on October 11th, near
   Avesnes-les-Aubert, under an intense enemy barrage, it was due
   to his personal courage and leadership that the ground gained by
   the battalion was maintained. He set a very fine example to all.

   YSER CANAL, 31st July, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty during an advance. When the leading waves were
   temporarily held up by fire from a blockhouse he pushed up to
   the obstacle and fired his rifle through the slits, regardless
   of the danger which confronted him. He then entered the
   blockhouse himself, dealt with the occupants, and enabled the
   advance to be continued. He was later badly wounded in the head,
   having acted throughout the operation with great gallantry and
   initiative.

   hostile barrage, displaying the greatest bravery. Later, on
   reaching the first objective and finding his left flank exposed,

   devotion to duty when in command of his company. He showed
   a splendid example of coolness, disregard of danger, and
   cheerfulness, and, although wounded, he remained at duty. It
   was largely owing to his influence that all ranks showed such a
   splendid spirit under the most intense hostile barrage, which
   lasted for 14 hours.

   Near ST. CHRIST, W. of the Somme, 22nd March to 2nd April, 1918.
   For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty during lengthy
   operations. After his C.O. had been killed, he took command of
   the battalion, which he handled with great skill and judgment,
   beating off several determined attacks, and when finally
   compelled to withdraw, doing so in a masterly manner, and with a
   minimum of casualties. His conduct throughout the operations set
   a fine example of courage and leadership, and was of great value
   in maintaining the high morale of the battalion.

ROSHER, Lieut.-Col. John Brenchley, _M.C._              10/Durham L.I.

   CANTAING, 21st November, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. On our cavalry being temporarily held up, and
   whilst the reinforcing infantry were still some way in the rear,
   he immediately despatched two companies to the assistance of the
   cavalry, and himself led up a third company as reinforcements.
   His prompt action immediately resulted in the capture of the

   PILKEM RIDGE, 31st July, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty on two successive occasions. He led his company
   across a canal under very heavy barrage, and, finding the only
   available bridge was broken, he personally secured a mat from
   the original line, and laid it down for his company to cross,
   thereby saving great congestion and countless lives. Later,
   when the regiment on his left was held up by machine-gun fire,
   he immediately grasped the situation, and pressed forward
   with another company, finally capturing the position. By his
   great presence of mind and personal example of gallantry and
   cheerfulness he kept his company going under the most adverse
   circumstances.

   HENDECOURT, 9th September, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   during an attack. He led the support company and eventually
   came up with the leading waves and took the objective, where he
   reorganised his men under very heavy fire. In a second attack

WENYON, Lieut.-Col. Herbert John                     8/Royal West Kent

   S.E. of YPRES, 9th September, 1917. He collected a party, and
   led them through heavy shell fire in a counter-attack upon
   one of our posts, which had been captured by the enemy, and
   although the position was exceptionally strong, it was retaken
   at the first attempt. This was entirely due to Captain Wenyon’s
   prompt action and the determined energy which he displayed at a
   critical moment.

WRIGHTSON, Lieut. Edward                    4/Northumberland Fusiliers

   In ITALY, 27th October, 1918. On the Piave, in the initial
   attack, he was left in command of the company, all other
   officers being killed or wounded. This company had orders to
   form a defensive flank, but Lieut. Wrightson, seeing that the
   attack in front was held up by uncut wire, led his company
   forward, cut a belt of wire by hand under severe machine-gun
   fire and assisted in taking the first objective. He personally
   shot down an enemy machine gunner who was causing many
   casualties. Ultimately his company formed a defensive flank
   to the brigade, and though losing over 50 in casualties he
   maintained and even improved his position by enterprise and
   patrols. On 29th October, he led his company again in an attack
   over several kilometres, capturing many prisoners and machine
   guns. Throughout the entire operations he showed exceptional
   gallantry and marked powers of leadership.

   On 23rd May, 1917, he led a formation of five machines to
   attack at least twice that number of hostile aeroplanes. Both
   formations became split up, and a general fight ensued. Five
   times during the combat he drove off hostile aeroplanes from

   devotion to duty. When his company commander became a casualty
   he assumed command at a critical period and worked his men

   great skill and determination in leading his men during an
   attack, over unknown ground, under heavy machine-gun fire, to an
   objective which was very oblique to the front of the assembly
   position, and was not defined by any particular feature. He
   accomplished his task with great success, capturing a machine
   gun and its whole detachment. While selecting the line for
   consolidation he moved about, under very heavy fire, encouraging
   and steadying the men by his resolute behaviour.

   Near YPRES, 20th September, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. By his skilful leadership his company
   captured all its objectives. When all the other officers became

   and by his personal encouragement ensured the consolidation of
   the captured positions and repelled several counter-attacks,
   inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

                              BAR TO M.C.

   Near POELCAPPELLE, 3rd October, 1917. In spite of difficult
   natural conditions and the total absence of all landmarks, he
   led his company to within 100 yards of the barrage line before
   an attack. Although his men were being continually bogged, he
   inspired them by his personal example to push on, and succeeded
   in capturing a farm held by the enemy. In spite of heavy
   casualties he fought his way from one position to another until
   he had gained his objective, which he successfully consolidated
   and held.


ANDREW, Capt. Reginald Barrett William Goldsworthy           15/London

   SHAFAT, 27th December, 1917. During an enemy attack he led his
   platoon through an intense artillery and machine-gun barrage
   over very difficult country to render assistance to a battalion
   at a critical juncture, which, thanks to his timely aid, was
   able to repulse the enemy attack. His courageous determination
   and initiative were most praiseworthy.

   WULVERGHEM, 3/4 August, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and good
   leadership during an advance. After his company had relieved
   another battalion he made a personal reconnaissance of the

   devotion to duty. Finding that a strong party of the enemy had
   occupied an artillery observation post in rear of the support
   line, this officer took two men and bombed them out, inflicting
   casualties and taking prisoners. Then, finding that his company
   headquarters were over-run by the enemy, he organised a party of
   bombers and cleared them out, too. His initiative and leadership
   were of great value.

   in charge of the leading wave of the company in a night attack.
   The enemy shelling was very heavy during the advance, but he
   rallied the men and was the first to enter the enemy post.

   himself a leader of great ability. During the consolidation he
   personally reconnoitred his platoon front and got in touch with
   troops on his flanks.

   he displayed conspicuous gallantry in wading up to his neck in

   of his battalion, and two platoons of another. He kept battalion
   headquarters fully informed throughout the day. Although both
   his flanks were exposed, he held the line under heavy enemy
   artillery and machine-gun fire for twenty-four hours, during
   which period he repulsed two counter-attacks. He did splendid
   work.

   Near ST. ELOI, 7th June, 1917. He displayed the greatest
   gallantry in handling a Stokes gun, following the first line
   infantry up to the final objective, where he consolidated later
   in the day. He showed great judgment, and was instrumental in
   repelling an enemy counter-attack by the skilful use of his gun.


BAILEY, Capt. John Vernon Moncas             Royal Army Ordnance Corps

   BLARGIES, 19th to 21st May, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry

   of heavy fire to uncouple and save half an ammunition train, the
   remainder of which was already alight. With the aid of another
   officer and some men he got the salvaged portion of the train
   away to comparative safety. His gallantry and coolness were of
   great service.

   engaged them, and after severe hand-to-hand fighting drove them
   out without any casualties among his own men. He handled a very
   awkward situation with the greatest coolness and courage.

   N.E. of POELCAPPELLE, 26th October, 1917. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty when in command of his company in

   devotion to duty when he was the senior company officer left.
   He was put in command of the remnants of four companies,
   about seventy men, and throughout the subsequent four days’

   organising successive defensive positions. His own personal
   example inspired the men to great efforts, and to a great extent
   contributed to their steadfastness.

   GIVENCHY, 9th to 16th March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. This officer handled his transport most
   efficiently throughout eight days’ operations. Each night
   supplies had to be brought up under heavy shell fire, and when
   water pumps were broken by shelling he quickly organised another
   system of supply, which necessitated his constant supervision,
   having to keep water carts on the move to avoid shell fire. His
   coolness and cheerfulness were a great asset.


 BARE, Capt. Alfred Raymond                   1/Loyal North Lancashire

   E. of YPRES, 25th September, 1917. He commanded his company with
   great skill and gallantry during an enemy attack. His tactical
   dispositions were sound, and he showed great determination and
   initiative. He had the most responsible position, and continued
   to hold it, though his right flank was enveloped. He set a
   splendid example to his men.


BARNES, 2/Lt. Alfred Douglas                                 23/London

   GRAINCOURT, 9th December, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty in an advanced post, which was repeatedly
   attacked by large numbers of the enemy. Time after time they

   was fighting continuously for six hours. His conduct throughout
   was a splendid example to all ranks.

   NEUVILLE VITASSE, 7/8 April, 1917. When in command of a patrol
   he penetrated the enemy’s front line and brought back valuable
   information, owing to which a serious obstacle to the advance
   was greatly diminished.


BARRETT, Capt. Wilfrid Morris                                12/London

   NEUVILLE VITASSE, 9th April, 1917. Although wounded in the head,

   continued to superintend for some time.


BARROW, Lieut. Thomas Henry                                  22/London

   Near TOURNAI, 7th November, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. Whilst he was bringing his company up to
   the front line on a very dark night they came under very heavy

   he himself being wounded. He nevertheless carried on for two
   hours, and then after reporting that the relief was complete he
   reported to the aid-post.


BARTON, 2/Lt. Guy Stanley                      1/Royal Welch Fusiliers

   FESTUBERT, 16th May, 1915. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty, when attacking with three bombers houses
   occupied by the enemy. On the morning of the 17th May he was
   wounded and sent down to the base, but, hearing on his way that
   the grenade company was without an officer, he refused to go any
   further and returned to take command.


BATE, Lieut. Herbert Roland             6/Manchester (19/Royal Sussex)

   WARGNIES, 4th November, 1918. He took over command of his
   company on the 2nd November, 1918, and led it with great
   gallantry and judgment throughout the attack. It was due to his
   fine leadership through heavy enemy barrage that such great
   success was won.


BATE, Capt. Robert Edmund de Breteuil               5/York & Lancaster

   GOMMECOURT, 27th March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and

   gallantry and devotion to duty during a raid. He led his platoon

BATZER, 2/Lt. Robert John                        10/London (1/Artists)

   TILLOY, 27th August, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. This officer led his company with great dash
   in an attack on a village, pushed through it, and captured
   a machine gun, which he turned on the enemy. Throughout
   the operations he set a fine example and led his company
   successfully, owing to previous personal reconnaissances made
   under fire.


BAYLIS, 2/Lt. Roland Harry                         7/Royal West Surrey

   BRAY-CORBIE ROAD, 8th August, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and initiative during an attack. He commanded the support
   platoon of the leading company, and on reaching his objective
   found his right flank open. On his own initiative he worked
   round, and in the face of heavy machine-gun fire twice led his
   men to the attack, knocking out four enemy machine guns and
   capturing about twenty-five prisoners. His splendid work enabled
   the troops on his right to continue their advance.


BAYZAND, 2/Lt. Geoffrey                              Coldstream Guards

   Near HOUTHOULST FOREST, 9th October, 1917. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty when in charge of the battalion
   forward party advancing in rear of the leading battalion. Later,
   he was in charge of all carrying parties, and successfully
   brought up material and water in spite of continuous shelling
   and the almost impassable condition of the ground. Fresh
   carrying parties were detailed each time, but he took charge of
   each one.

                              BAR TO M.C.

   S. of GAVRELLE, 27/28 February, 1918. When in command of a party
   raiding the enemy trenches, he led his men close up under our
   barrage, which had the effect of avoiding casualties to his
   party and of surprising the enemy to a far greater degree than
   otherwise would have been the case. He showed fine judgment in
   deciding when the object of the raid had been attained and in
   ordering the withdrawal at the earliest possible moment, he
   himself being the last to return to our trenches. His courage,
   powers of leadership, and ability were beyond all praise, and
   contributed largely to the initial success of the raid.


BEAL, Capt. Leonard Frank                                    2/Bedford

   POZIERES, 7th to 9th August, 1916. For conspicuous gallantry
   during operations. He consolidated his position under heavy
   shell and machine-gun fire, and got into touch with the
   troops on his right. In spite of shell-fire he rendered a
   most useful report with map. He had previously done fine work
   in consolidating and holding a position in a wood under very
   difficult circumstances.


BEATON, 2/Lt. Grover Cleveland             143rd Siege Battery, R.G.A.

   his battery, situated several hundred yards off, was subjected
   to a heavy mustard gas and high explosive bombardment, and the
   command post, in which two officers were hit, he at once went
   to their assistance, and although himself suffering from the
   effects of the gas, carried one officer, who had been mortally
   wounded, to a place of safety, and then returned and assisted
   the other officer, who had also been wounded, out of danger. He
   then returned a third time, rallied the men and ensured that
   every possible precaution was taken. He showed the greatest
   gallantry and pluck.


BEESLEY, Lieut. Herbert                         5/Lancashire Fusiliers

   to duty during an attack. With great gallantry he pushed
   forward to the furthest objective of the Brigade, under heavy
   machine-gun and rifle fire. When the enemy counter-attacked,
   though twice wounded, he continued to hold his post on the flank
   until relieved. He showed a quick grasp of the situation and
   great courage and coolness.


BEETHAM, Lieut. George Clarence                     5/York & Lancaster

   HAVRINCOURT, 20th November, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. He led his men with great determination in an
   attack under heavy machine-gun fire. He rushed an enemy machine
   gun and captured it, together with the whole team. He then
   reorganised his men and captured the final objective, taking
   over sixty prisoners.

   Near RIDGE WOOD, 8th May, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty while in command of the company in close
   support. Thanks to his coolness and good leadership his line was
   held intact, although the enemy had forced the front line. He
   also very gallantly led his company in a counter-attack later in
   the day.


BELL, Capt. David Cockburn                        9/Middlesex (R.F.C.)

   In ITALY, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty.
   When on observation duty, together with another officer, in a
   balloon, which was set on fire by an enemy machine, he remained
   in the burning balloon endeavouring at very great risk to
   himself to get his companion, who had been rendered insensible
   by a bullet wound in the head, overboard in his parachute. Being
   unable to do this, he was compelled to abandon his companion,
   whose death was subsequently found to have been due to the
   bullet wound, and to jump from the burning balloon.


BELL, 2/Lt. Henry Leonard                                     1/London

   Near FREMICOURT, 24th March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. He went forward with a Lewis gun and two men
   when the enemy were about to attack. By carefully ranging his
   gun he succeeded in putting a number of the enemy out of action
   and in breaking up their attack. Later in the day, when his
   company commander became a casualty, he took command, and led
   his men with marked skill.


BENNETT, 2/Lt. Eugené Paul                            2/Worcestershire

   Awarded 1st January, 1916.


BENSON, 2/Lt. Thomas Norman                             5(4)Gloucester

   KNOLL, 24/25 April, 1917. He handled his company with great
   skill and courage under most critical conditions. He withdrew

   his personal bravery and determination he set a fine example to
   those under him.


BENTLEY, 2/Lt. Alfred                                        4/Norfolk

   YPRES, 11th August, 1917. He led the assaulting platoons of his
   company in a most gallant manner to the recapture of a strong
   point which was affording the enemy an important advantage over
   our lines of communication. By his coolness and fine personal
   example under most trying circumstances all subsequent attempts
   by the enemy to recapture the strong point were frustrated.
   During the afternoon he went out on patrol and captured two of
   the enemy from a concrete emplacement, which was afterwards of
   great tactical value, and the following night, although wounded
   and seriously gassed, he extricated a number of officers from a
   dug-out who had been gassed at the same time as himself.


BERLINER, Capt. Philip Barnett                                7/London

   MALARD WOOD, 8th August, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry in
   action. He was leading his company with great determination
   through the enemy’s front lines when he was severely wounded in
   the leg, but he struggled on for a thousand yards with the help
   of his runner, encouraging and directing his men. All the other
   officers had become casualties, and his courage and endurance
   were of particular value to the success of the attack.


BERNAYS, Capt. John Stewart Noall                     6/Leicestershire

   EAUCOURT L’ABBAYE, 25th August, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry.
   When an enemy counter-attack was launched on his company, his
   swift appreciation of the situation and skilful handling of his
   men under heavy fire, saved a very doubtful situation. Later, he
   again displayed great ability during an attack, and throughout
   the whole operations his courage and cheerfulness set a fine
   example to all ranks (at BEAULENCOURT, 1st September, 1918).


BERTIE, Capt. Alberic Willoughby                                R.F.A.

   S.E. of YPRES, 7th June, 1917. He led his company with the
   greatest gallantry and determination to their objective.
   Although wounded in three places, he disregarded his wounds
   until the objective had been consolidated three hours later,
   although they were sufficiently severe to justify him not
   remaining on duty. He set a splendid example of courage and
   determination, which had an immense moral effect on his men.


BLAKE, Major Charles Edwin Norman                               R.F.A.

   and devotion to duty on several occasions when bringing up
   rations and material to the front line on pack animals, over

   In spite of casualties to animals and a stampede caused by
   shells, he never failed to deliver the whole of the stores.
   Throughout he set a very fine example to his men.


BONE, Capt. Frederick Howard                               2/Wiltshire

   MORCHIES, 22nd to 25th March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. He formed a defensive flank with half
   his company, and with the remainder reinforced the front line,
   inflicting severe losses on the enemy and holding them in
   check for many hours. He subsequently withdrew, and, although
   in an exhausted state, helped with the reorganisation of the
   battalion. He showed untiring energy and great coolness in the
   face of overwhelming numbers.

   valuable information as to the enemy dispositions and the
   position of the battalion on the left. He performed his duties
   with much courage and ability.

   devotion to duty whilst acting as Liaison Officer. He showed
   the greatest courage and initiative in obtaining valuable
   information under intense machine-gun and shell fire. It was
   owing to his gallantry and dash that the leading battalions were
   kept in touch with one another, and thus greatly contributed to
   the success of the operation.


BRENCHLEY, 2/Lt. John                              4/Coldstream Guards

   Near BOESINGHE, 27th to 31st July, 1917. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty whilst putting out bridges
   across a canal. It was entirely due to his untiring and gallant
   efforts that the bridges were kept in repair, in spite of
   frequent breaks by hostile shell fire, and that they were in a
   serviceable condition by zero hour, in good time for our attack.


BREWER, Capt. Charles Herbert                  2/Bedfordshire (R.A.F.)

   In FRANCE, 10/11 March, 1918. He set out to make a special
   railway reconnaissance, and though the weather conditions became
   very bad he continued his task with the greatest determination.
   His engine began to fail when he was a long distance over the
   enemy’s lines. By skilful piloting he succeeded in crossing the
   enemy’s trenches, but the machine crashed in “No Man’s Land,”
   and turned completely over. Heavy machine-gun fire was opened
   by the enemy, and though his jaw was broken he extricated the
   observer, who was pinned under the machine and was unconscious,
   and dragged him to a shell-hole in the face of the enemy’s fire.

   and got into action on the final objective in a very short time.

   in action and supplied with ammunition, until relieved three
   days later. It was only owing to his brilliant leadership and
   cheerful example that the mortars were kept in action.

   front line, and took command until the battalion was relieved,
   showing marked coolness and contempt of danger.

   machine, which he forced to land in our lines. On a later
   occasion he volunteered to attack a hostile aerodrome in foggy
   weather. He dropped four bombs from a height of 200 feet, which
   blew in the sides of one of the hangars, and then attacked horse
   and motor transport on the road, finally engaging enemy troops
   in the main street of a village with machine-gun fire. He has
   shown great skill and daring as a leader of offensive patrol.

   devotion to duty when in command of a raiding party. He led his
   party against an enemy strong point, and was the first to enter
   it, shooting two of the enemy with his revolver and bayonetting
   a third. Though under fire from another strong point he very
   coolly made a careful reconnaissance of both positions, and
   brought back valuable information. He set a magnificent example
   of coolness under fire to his men, and it was largely due to his
   initiative and energy that the operations were successful.

   POEILLY, 21st to 23rd March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. This officer handled his company with skill
   and resource for some ten days’ fighting, until he was wounded.
   When in battalion reserve he made several counter-attacks, and
   closed a gap in the right flank. His company found the rearguard
   at the crossing of a river, and it was mainly due to his leading
   that the enemy was held off while the retirement was being
   effected.

   the ground, and received a serious wound. Despite this, and the
   most adverse weather conditions, he succeeded in locating the

   and bringing back most valuable information. By his disregard
   of personal danger and unfailing devotion to duty he has set a
   splendid example to all ranks.

   devotion to duty. He constantly displayed the utmost courage in
   visiting all his posts and looking after his men during heavy

   he successfully maintained his line against repeated attacks,
   although for nearly six hours his left flank was unprotected.

   machine guns and many prisoners. He set a splendid example of

   gallantry and devotion to duty. After the enemy had secured a

   with his platoon and cleared them out, and when his original
   bombers had sustained casualties and were too tired to throw
   bombs accurately he collected a fresh squad of men from another
   unit and attacked again. His excellent leading, clear orders,
   and great coolness under fire very largely contributed to the
   success of the attack.


CARD, 2/Lt. Arthur Henry                                  12/Middlesex

   devotion to duty. This officer’s company covered the retirement
   of two brigades, and was then sent back by him as ordered. He

   a position where he could enfilade the enemy, and with the man
   to carry spare drums, inflicted severe casualties, bringing them
   to a halt. The following day he organised a delaying action and
   held up an attack. Throughout the ten days’ operations until he
   was wounded he did much good work.

   repelling the enemy’s infantry.


CLIVELY, Major Richard Constantine                       16/Tank Corps

   QUENNEMONT COPSE, September 29th, 1918. For conspicuous
   gallantry and excellent leadership. When the situation was
   obscure, and it was obvious that the attack had miscarried,
   and the enemy was holding the line in strength only 500 yards
   in front, he held a conference with the infantry company
   commanders, and under heavy shell and machine-gun fire organised
   a fresh attack to endeavour to reach the start line. He
   distributed his tanks amongst the infantry, and by his coolness
   set a splendid example to all ranks.

   REGHA TRENCH, 23rd to 31st October, 1916. He displayed great

   LOMBARTZYDE, 10th July, 1917. As artillery Liaison Officer,
   at a time when all communication with his artillery group was
   severed, he made repeated attempts to restore the connection,
   and personally crossed a river under heavy fire in his efforts

   gallantry and disregard of danger throughout the operations, and
   only desisted from his efforts on receiving the direct order
   from his headquarters to do so.


COLE, Lieut. Gordon James                             17/Rifle Brigade

   N. of FAMPOUX, 23rd March, 1918. When the enemy had forced an
   entrance into the front line trench and were bombing along it,
   and the situation appeared to be critical, he went forward from
   headquarters to reconnoitre. He collected all available men
   and formed a defensive flank and then organised and took part
   in a counter-attack which drove out the enemy and completely
   re-established the position. He showed splendid skill and
   resource in a most difficult situation.


COLE, 2/Lt. William Maurice                                5/Leicester

   Near LE TOURET, 9/10 June, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. He led a patrol in daylight to the enemy’s
   lines, crawled through three belts of wire, surrounded, with
   three of his men, an enemy organised shell-hole and tried to
   take the sentry prisoner. The man resisted, and the noise
   disturbed an enemy machine-gun post close by, so they shot him
   for identification. Next day he again led a daylight patrol and
   gained valuable knowledge of the enemy’s movements, locating
   several posts and the time at which they were manned.


COLEMAN, 2/Lt. George Herbert                              5/Liverpool

   Near RAILWAY WOOD, 4/5 March, 1917. In leading two separate

   energy during the attack. On reaching his objective in command
   of a company, he was senior officer left in the battalion,
   and supervised the reorganisation practically single-handed,
   completing it in a very short time, though the men were tired
   and inexperienced. He showed fine determination under trying
   conditions.


COLLINS, 2/Lt. John Edmund                                   22/London

   METZ, 23rd March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and devotion
   when fighting a rearguard action. Although his platoon suffered
   many casualties, and was almost surrounded, by his disregard of

   hours, at a time when delay was of the greatest importance. His
   gallant conduct undoubtedly saved the battalion and enabled the
   withdrawal to be completed.

   GAZA, 26th March, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and devotion
   to duty. He led his company with great dash and gallantry in an

   he repulsed with heavy loss the numerous determined attacks
   launched by the enemy against his position, though the latter
   was enfiladed by machine-gun fire from both flanks. His
   gallantry and able leadership merited the highest praise.

   Near MANANCOURT, on the night of 5th September, 1918. For
   conspicuous gallantry and determination. He went forward and
   took command of a company that had got separated from the
   battalion during the attack and lost all its officers except
   one. Having collected the company together in the pitch darkness
   he got it into position. Although much fatigued the men led by
   him gained their objective, killing many of the enemy and taking
   a number of prisoners and machine guns. He behaved splendidly.


CONIBEER, 2/Lt. Ralph William                            3/East Surrey

   BOURSIES, 23/24 October, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty during the operations. He led his platoon

   Near LAGNICOURT, 21st March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty during a hostile attack, when the expeditious
   manner in which he moved the Lewis guns of his company to its
   threatened flank was largely responsible for holding up the
   enemy’s advance. Throughout the action he commanded his men,
   under extremely heavy fire, with the greatest courage and skill
   until severely wounded.


COOKE, 2/Lt. Philip Andrew                                  8/K.R.R.C.

   devotion to duty, when he commanded his section so well that his
   guns wiped out the personnel of three machine guns and silenced
   two others; and when he retired his section without loss, after
   waiting until the enemy was within 100 yards of him, enabled
   the garrison of a village to get clear. Again, when his battery
   made a fine stand, his calm forethought and determination were
   prominent.

   qualities of initiative and marked ability in dealing

   devotion to duty. This officer in command of a company was

   to duty. When commanding his platoon during an advance, an enemy
   strong point manned by machine guns threatened to hold up the
   right flank of his battalion. With great courage and initiative,
   he organised a bombing party, personally led it against the
   position, and after a fierce encounter, killed the garrison and
   put the guns out of action. On reaching the first objective,
   he took command and reorganised half of the battalion, and
   throughout the advance he displayed the greatest personal
   courage and gallantry in the forefront of the fighting.

   conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty as Intelligence
   Officer during the operations. On the 17th October especially,
   when the position was very obscure owing to the heavy mist, he
   made his way to the assaulting troops, put some who had lost
   direction on their right way, and cleared up the situation
   generally. All this was done under heavy machine-gun fire.

   In FRANCE, 8th and 11th March, 1918. Whilst on artillery
   observation duty he engaged a hostile scout, which he succeeded
   in sending down out of control. He then continued to observe
   for the shoot, and successfully accomplished his task. Later,
   whilst again on artillery patrol, though attacked by five
   hostile aeroplanes, he, by successful man[oe]uvring, enabled
   his observer to fire several bursts into the leader of the
   formation, whose machine was seen to go down in a vertical
   nose-dive and crash to earth. Continuing the fight against
   the remaining four hostile machines, he eventually forced
   them away, and succeeded in ranging on and neutralizing three
   hostile batteries. He set a magnificent example of skill and
   determination.


DAVIES, 2/Lt. Gwylon                        4/Northumberland Fusiliers

   CAULINCOURT, 21st to 27th March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. During a withdrawal this officer
   volunteered to go forward and locate the enemy position,

   devotion to duty in action. In every phase of the fighting he
   led his men in a most splendid manner. His tireless energy and

   BOURLON WOOD, 23rd November, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. When his company had reached their objective
   he heard that men of another battalion on his left were in
   difficulties. Collecting a few men he went to their assistance,
   and by pushing forward enabled them to continue their advance.
   Returning to his company he repeatedly led his men forward
   and did much to bring the heavy enemy counter-attacks to a
   standstill. He showed splendid coolness and initiative.

   carrying and ration parties up to the front line, and carried

   under an intense barrage. He also took command of his company,
   reorganised them and brought them out successfully.


DAVIS, 2/Lt. Ralph                                           Leicester

   GUEUDECOURT, 25th September, 1916. He led his men in the

   consolidation, and set a splendid example.


 DAVIS, Capt. Richard Nevill                               2/Leicester

   MONTNOIR, 17th April, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty during an enemy attack. He kept the situation
   well in hand during the temporary absence of his commanding
   officer, and ensured the right flank of his battalion being
   thrown back so as to enable the front positions to be
   maintained. He continually sent back information as to the
   situation. His work has been splendid, and his coolness under
   fire most noticeable.


DAVIS, 2/Lt. Thomas Henry Clifford                              R.F.A.

   SAVERNAKE WOOD, 18th September, 1916. When his O.P. was blown in

   and enterprise.

   CROISILLES-HENIN ROAD, 31st March, 1917. He led his platoon in

   POELCAPPELLE, 12th October, 1917. Shortly after the attack was
   launched the leading platoons of his company were held up by
   intense machine-gun fire. He pushed on and, in conjunction with

   attack. After his company commander became a casualty, he took
   command of the company and some men of another division, and

   on the enemy by his prompt action.


DEBONO, Lieut. George Peter                              5/Royal Berks

   and determination. He held on to the post of which he was in
   command, though entirely surrounded by the enemy, who were
   eventually repelled with heavy casualties. It was chiefly owing

   maintained intact.


DE LANDRE-GROGAN, Lieut. Leon Victor St. Patrick

DOUGLAS, 2/Lt. George Frederick                                   R.E.

   S. of ST. JULIEN, 8th September, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty when in charge of gas projectors emplaced
   in a very exposed position. A hostile barrage being put down
   on and behind the projector emplacements he distributed his
   men in shell holes, and, without calling for any assistance
   from them, himself completed the final connections. Withholding
   his fire until the appointed time he fired four out of the
   five batteries, only returning to cover after having assured
   himself that all the projectors had fired. This involved careful
   and cool-headed work in a very exposed position and under
   exceptionally heavy fire.


DOWDEN, 2/Lt. Henry James                        312th Brigade, R.F.A.

   got all the guns into action, and maintained a quick rate of
   fire in spite of heavy barrage. He fired one gun himself until

   wounded officer.


DOWSON, Lieut. Sydney Houghton                         1/Royal Warwick

   Awarded 1st January, 1919.


DOYLE, Lieut. Algernon Gordon                   123rd Field Coy., R.E.

   Near MONTAY, 15/16 October, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   determination in connection with bridging the RIVER SELLE. On
   the night of 15/16 he took measurements of the river to enable
   a tank bridge to be made. On the 16th he prepared the necessary
   materials for the bridge, and that night worked for nine hours
   breast-deep in the water under heavy shell and machine-gun
   fire and sniping. When approaching daylight forced him to stop
   work, he had, by twenty-three hours’ continuous work under
   most trying conditions, ensured the success of the scheme. He
   continued the work during the next two nights, and the bridge
   was satisfactorily completed twenty-four hours before zero. His
   bridging work proved of great value in the attack on the 20th.


DRAKEFORD, Capt. Herbert                                   7/Liverpool

   HOUPLINES, 15/16 July, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty during a determined hostile raid upon our front
   line. He organised a post for defence, and succeeded in beating
   off a strong party of the enemy from both front and rear. He
   then visited all the front line positions in his sector under
   an intense barrage, during which he killed one of the enemy and
   obtained identifications.


DUCKWORTH, 2/Lt. John Edwin Hardie              7/Worcester (16/Devon)

   Near RONSSOY, 18th September, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and initiative when he led the attack splendidly and was the
   first man on the objective between TOINE WOOD and ORCHARD POST.
   At one period he got considerably in advance of the main force
   but still pushed on. Without the courageous example set by this
   officer it is doubtful whether this position would have been
   taken at the time. One hundred prisoners and a machine gun
   were captured in this sector alone. During consolidation, with

   to duty in leading his company successfully when all the other

   situation. He set a splendid example of determination and
   resource.

   numerous snipers, on two separate occasions carried out personal
   reconnaissances as far as the forward occupied posts, bringing

   on very many occasions carried out exceptionally valuable patrol

   devotion to duty. He remained with another officer and a few men

   HILL 60 Sector, 7/8 June, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and

EDWARDS, Capt. William Howell                 11/Royal Welch Fusiliers

   Near MONTAY, 20th October, 1918. In the attack he showed
   conspicuous gallantry as adjutant. Under constant machine-gun
   fire he made the preliminary arrangements for the assembly of
   the battalion east of the RIVER SELLE. It was largely due to his
   skill that the battalion was able to assemble so close to the
   first objective without enemy knowledge.


EGLINGTON, Lieut. Dudley Charles          2/Royal Highlanders (R.F.C.)

   LILLE, 20th May, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and devotion
   when acting as an observer. In the course of a fight with
   several Albatross scouts, in which he shot down one, the pilot

   the machine to dive with the engine full on. He climbed out,
   standing outside the fuselage on the lower plane, dragged the
   pilot back, and, switching off the engine, pulled the machine
   out of its dive. Not being a trained pilot, his act exhibited
   great fearlessness and skill.

   gallantry and devotion to duty in command of a company,

   courage were pre-eminent. At one critical moment he hastily
   reorganised and established a defensive flank, which gave time
   for a new position to be taken up in rear.

   troops on his flanks by giving them information and enabling
   them to continue the attack.

   BOURSIES, 3rd September, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry during
   an attack. Having obtained his objective with his company, he
   at once pushed forward patrols to the next tactical feature,
   thereby enabling the advance of the battalion to be expedited.

   greatest coolness and devotion to duty under heavy gas shelling,
   and, though gassed himself, remained at duty until three out of
   his four platoons had established themselves.

   HAMEL, 26th to 28th March, 1918. During three days’ operations,
   he carried out a valuable reconnaissance under direct

   fire was a splendid example to his men.

   withdrawn, he attempted to rush a hostile post with eight men.

   strong. A splendid leader, who can always get the best out of

   encountered a much stronger hostile party, which attempted to

   two points. By working close up he was able to locate the exact
   position of these guns. He further located two machine-gun posts
   further behind, from which our men were being sniped, and again
   two more posts from which a machine gun was captured. He was
   out for nearly four hours, most of the time behind the enemy’s
   posts. He displayed conspicuous gallantry and skill.

   FLAVY-LE-MARTEL, 23rd March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. When his commanding officer had become a

   and initiative during an attack. The officers commanding the two

   became somewhat disorganised. He immediately moved forward
   his support company, reorganised the line, and reached and

   gallantry and devotion to duty. He displayed the greatest
   courage in consolidating, under heavy fire, a position just

   re-established the position. His cheerful courage and energy

FLEMING, 2/Lt. Herbert Sidney               5/Northumberland Fusiliers

   Near LAVENTIE, 1918. This officer, who was commanding a platoon,
   had orders to advance. An hour after receiving the orders he
   led his platoon forward, and, although he had never seen the
   country before him during daylight, kept direction accurately,
   quickly taking each objective as he came to it. Although met
   by hostile machine-gun fire, he pushed on through two hostile
   strong points, capturing a machine gun and the gunners, and
   establishing himself well in advance of his final objective.
   By his coolness under fire not only did he set a good example
   to his platoon but inflicted many losses on the enemy, whom he
   encountered in greatly superior numbers.

   devotion to duty while in charge of the right attacking platoon

   spirit and powers of leadership, personally accounting for many
   of the enemy. When the time for withdrawal came, he remained
   behind to assure himself that all his casualties were brought
   back, assisting to carry some of them himself. He was the only
   surviving officer, and his gallant behaviour throughout was a
   fine example to all ranks.


FORBES, Lieut. George Freeman Murray                      1/Gloucester

   N. of GRICOURT, 29th September, 1918, when a frontal attack was
   held up, this officer on his own initiative worked round on a
   flank and entered the enemy’s trenches. By this action he was
   enabled to organise a bombing attack party which worked up to
   the trench and took the enemy by surprise and caused him to
   retire. This enabled the frontal attack to gain their objective.
   He showed the greatest gallantry, initiative and resourcefulness.


FOULKES, 2/Lt. Edward                                 South Lancashire

   devotion to duty during an enemy attack. This officer displayed

   and coolness and captured his objective under very heavy rifle
   and machine-gun fire.

   good leadership. When the advance on his flank was held up by

   his fine example inspired confidence in all ranks.

   magnificent example.

   Near TOURNAI, 8th November, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty in action. He led his platoon with great
   determination in the face of heavy machine-gun fire, in
   endeavouring to force a passage across the ESCAUT RIVER, and

   despite heavy casualties, hustled the enemy to the river bank,
   and almost prevented the last bridge being blown up.

   S. of HEBUTERNE, 17th July, 1918. He led his platoon forward
   from the reserve company through heavy shell fire with
   great gallantry and ability, reaching the forward companies
   with ammunition and entrenching tools, immediately after
   the objective had been gained, thereby greatly assisting
   the consolidation. When he found that one of the forward
   companies had lost nearly all its officers, he sent his platoon
   back, remaining himself to assist in the organisation and
   consolidation of the position, which was successfully carried
   out in spite of heavy shell and machine-gun fire. He displayed
   throughout great coolness and complete disregard of danger.

   devotion to duty when in charge of a section working on tracks
   immediately behind the assaulting infantry. In spite of heavy
   fire he kept in touch with the situation by constant personal
   reconnaissance, and thus enabled the work to be pushed forward
   rapidly with small loss. His party was instrumental in capturing
   seven prisoners.

   Near ORSINVAL, 4th November, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty when in command of Stokes mortar section. When
   the leading wave was held up by machine-gun fire, he brought
   up a mortar, and, despite casualties caused by the heavy fire
   directed on him, silenced the machine guns. The promptness with
   which he grasped the situation enabled the infantry to advance
   and gain their objective with small loss.

GAYWOOD, 2/Lt. Frederick James                  8/East Surrey (T.M.B.)

   S. of MIRAUMONT, 15th February, 1917. He established his two

   CHERISY, 3rd May, 1917. He accompanied and supported the
   assaulting battalion with his trench mortar, knocking out two
   enemy machine guns and accounting for a number of the enemy.

   assisted in reorganising the infantry.

                          SECOND BAR TO M.C.

   Near PRIEZ FARM, 1st September, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. He kept his company close behind the
   barrage, and took the farm in the first rush, the garrison of
   about 100 retiring. By the time the enemy counter-attacked he
   had organised a strong defence, and easily beat them off. With
   the assistance of two other officers he gradually rounded up
   the enemy in the vicinity, and after seven hours’ fighting they
   surrendered. His initiative and leadership gained this very
   formidable strong point.


GEORGE, Major Walter Hope                                    16/M.G.C.

   Awarded 3rd June, 1919.

   THILLOY, 27th August, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and able
   leadership. After his company commander had become a casualty
   this officer took command and materially assisted the advance by
   working his men round to a flank and engaging enemy machine guns
   which were holding up the company in front. Throughout the day
   he set a fine example to those around him.

GIBBS, Capt. Lawrence Henry                    10/Lancashire Fusiliers

   GOUZEAUCOURT, 9th September, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry

   gas bombardment and reached the objective, driving the enemy
   out, killing two with his revolver. His company was then counter
   attacked from the flank, but the attack was repulsed, with
   the loss of twenty-two prisoners. He set a splendid example
   throughout the day’s fighting, constantly exposing himself and
   encouraging his men.


GIBBS, Capt. Thomas Raleigh                            2/Highland L.I.

   N. of VERTAIN, 23rd October, 1918. For most conspicuous
   gallantry and initiative during the operations. On reaching his
   objective he discovered a pocket of the enemy holding a sunken
   road. He rushed forward with one N.C.O. and killed two of the
   enemy and captured thirty. Six machine guns were found in the
   road, and but for his dash and courage a dangerous situation
   would have arisen.

                              BAR TO M.C.

   Awarded 1st January, 1919.


GIBSON, Lieut. Archibald                       2/Royal Scots Fusiliers

   LEDEGHEM, 14th October, 1918. During the advance he was
   conspicuous for his initiative and contempt of danger. His
   company was in support, and on seeing the front company held up
   by heavy machine-gun fire he personally reconnoitred the ground
   and then pushed a platoon round the flank which captured the
   position and thus allowed the flank to advance. After taking
   the final objective he went forward under machine-gun fire and
   sniping, got in touch with his flanks, and selected the best
   positions for his men.


GIBSON, 2/Lt. Dudley Robert                              4/Royal Berks

   FAUQUISSART, 19th July, 1916. He led his platoon with great
   dash up to the enemy wire. Finding they could not get through,

   under heavy fire.

   Near RANSART, 17/18 February, 1917. He personally conducted the
   raiding parties back to the supporting troops, and, on hearing
   that one group had not returned, he went back, found it, and
   let it back through the gap. He previously carried out several
   daring reconnaissances of the enemy’s position.

                              BAR TO M.C.

   NEUVE EGLISE, 13th April, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty during a counter-attack which repulsed the

   service.

   Near YPRES, 31st July, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. Having led his company to its objective, he
   held on throughout the day under a very heavy bombardment,

   the heaviest fire.

   FONTAINE-LES-CROISILLES, 28th May, 1917. At great personal risk
   he extinguished a burning ammunition dump. His promptitude and
   fearlessness saved several hundred rounds of ammunition, and
   probably many lives as well.


GILLESPIE, Lieut. Thomas Leslie                            4/Worcester

   E. of BAILLEUL, 1st September, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and good leadership. When his company, which had been ordered
   to move up and fill a gap between two corps, was held up by
   machine-gun fire, he went forward and by personal reconnaissance
   located enemy machine guns, and turned his Lewis guns on to them
   with great effect, thus clearing the way for his company. The
   success of the advance was largely due to his fine courage and
   personal example.


GILLOTT, Lieut. Cecil                                   14/Durham L.I.

   Near MORCHAIN, 25th March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. When defending part of a line with his
   platoon, although wounded early in the attack, he remained with
   his men until hit for the third time. By his fine example of
   coolness and absolute disregard for personal safety, his platoon
   was able to inflict heavy losses on the enemy, and to hold them
   up until they had worked round the flanks.


GJERTSEN, Capt. Rudolf                                         4/Essex

   Awarded 1st January, 1918.

   MOEUVRES, 27th September, 1918. He displayed most gallant
   leadership, capturing more than 200 prisoners in the Canal.

   objective. He inspired his men by his utter disregard of danger,
   and continued to set a splendid example until wounded a short
   while afterwards.

GODFREY, 2/Lt. Stanley Charles                 2/Royal Scots Fusiliers

   GUN TRENCH, 30th September, 1915. For conspicuous gallantry
   when the Germans had succeeded in entering Gun Trench and were
   bombing down it. It was largely owing to the personal bravery
   and initiative of 2/Lt. Godfrey that their advance was stopped.
   He organised bombers, collected bombs and attacked the enemy,
   gaining some ground. He was continuously fighting from 6.30 p.m.
   till 5 a.m. next day.


GOLDIE, Capt. Bernard Charles Mary                           10/London

   Near SIVRI TEPE, EGYPT, 19th September, 1918, For conspicuous
   gallantry and dash during the operations. He, in conjunction
   with another officer, each in command of a platoon of the
   advanced guard, though taken on both flanks by machine-gun fire,
   pushed on, captured their objective and several prisoners. This
   manœuvre turned Sivri Tepe, and was instrumental in causing the
   enemy to retire, thus materially assisting the advance.


GOLDSBURY, 2/Lt. Charles Melville                             7/London

   Near HOLLEBEKE, 9/10 July, 1917. When in command of a raid, he
   was the first to reach the farm which was the objective, and in
   spite of enemy barrage and heavy rifle fire dashed on ahead and
   bombed the place, setting it on fire and capturing 10 prisoners.
   He was severely wounded whilst returning, having remained
   behind in the burning building to search for a trench mortar.
   The success of the enterprise was entirely due to his splendid
   example of fearlessness and personal leading.


GOSLETT, Capt. Raymond Gwynne                                 R.A.S.C.

   Awarded 1st January, 1918.


GOSNEY, Lieut. Harold William                         13/Rifle Brigade

   Near LOUVIGNIES, 4th November, 1918. For conspicuous
   gallantry and cool ability. His company commander and others
   being wounded, he reorganised the company, and on reaching the
   first objective he personally went along his line, adjusting
   liaison on both flanks. On reaching the final objective, and
   finding himself the senior officer present, he superintended
   consolidation on the battalion front.


GOTCH, 2/Lt. Davis Ingle                                 6/Northampton

   REGINA TRENCH, 25th to 29th October, 1916. For conspicuous
   gallantry in action. Although several times buried himself,

   E. of POELCAPPELLE, 31st March and 1st April, 1918. He was in
   command of a patrol which was fired on by an enemy machine gun
   at a range of 30 yards, and three of his men were wounded. He
   succeeded in dragging two of them back with the help of the
   third man a distance of 200 yards to a point where he could
   return to our lines and bring back help. His courageous and
   determined action prevented the men from falling into the
   enemy’s hands.


GOULD, Lieut. Cyril Edward              280th (London) Brigade, R.F.A.

   SEBOURG, 5th November, 1918. Whilst coming into action in a
   new position, his battery came under heavy fire, which caused
   a block in the traffic and the ditching of one of the guns. He
   displayed great presence of mind and coolness, quickly found
   another route of advance, and eventually got the battery forward
   into action. He thereby enabled not only his battery but many
   others in the rear to get forward and into action.


GRAHAM, Lieut. Keith                                      15/Hampshire

   MENIN, 2nd October, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. Although nearly surrounded by enemy machine
   guns he held his position and succeeded in capturing a strong

   Near FRELINGHEM, 1st October, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. When sent out on a patrol with three men
   to examine a river, he found a footbridge, crossed it, and
   made a thorough reconnaissance. On returning, the enemy made
   an unsuccessful attempt to cut him off, and he withdrew his
   patrol under fire without a casualty. On the following night
   when on patrol he was instrumental in the discovery of a second
   footbridge, and owing to his good leadership his patrol gained
   most valuable information. On both occasions he showed great
   determination and sound judgment.


GRAY, Capt. Harold Vernon                                 6/Gloucester

   HOLNON WOOD, 22nd March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. The enemy were believed to have penetrated
   into a position held by an advanced right company, and he was
   sent to report on the situation. He displayed great courage and
   resource both in going and returning under heavy shell fire,
   organised the position, and successfully returned with a very
   clear report.


GRAY, 2/Lt. Harry Albert                               Royal West Kent

   N. of YPRES-MENIN ROAD, 3rd October, 1917. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty in maintaining direction as
   leader of an assaulting wave. When his company commander became
   a casualty he reorganised the company, which had lost over 60
   per cent., and beat off several minor attacks. He remained
   with his men in a shallow trench when they were being heavily
   shelled, when he might have gone to his headquarters. The good
   work done by the company was mainly due to his splendid example.


GRAY, Lieut. James                                 5/Royal West Surrey

   Near GRAND ROZOY, 29th July, 1918. He repeatedly
   distinguished himself in action, especially when he led his

   situations.


GRAY, Lieut. Samuel Alexander                                23/London

   HAPPY VALLEY, 22nd August, 1918. He carried out several
   important reconnaissances under heavy fire, bringing back
   information of essential value on each occasion. Later, when
   the enemy attacked with some success, he fought a determined
   rearguard action, holding successive positions to the last
   moment. Throughout the operations his gallantry and devotion to
   duty were conspicuous examples to his men.


GREEN, 2/Lt. Arthur                                         3/D.C.L.I.

   Near MERVILLE, 12th April, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. He acted as adjutant until he was wounded, and
   rendered the utmost assistance in reforming and reorgansing a
   defensive line at a time when great pressure was being brought
   against the battalion and the position was obscure. His personal
   example under trying conditions and heavy fire at close range
   was altogether admirable.


GREEN, Lieut. George Richard                          Grenadier Guards

   Awarded 3rd June, 1918.


GREEN, Capt. William Charles                          1/South Stafford

   gallantry and devotion to duty during an enemy attack. When
   the enemy had broken through on his left and his company had
   suffered severe losses, he rallied the remainder of his men
   and held on for a considerable time. Having lost touch with
   troops on his right, he withdrew to a trench in rear and again
   maintained touch with them. His numbers being greatly depleted,
   he attached himself to the troops on the right until wounded the
   following day.


GREENWOOD, Lieut. James Hurst                       11/Royal West Kent

   YPRES-COMINES CANAL, 14th June, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. Although wounded in the jaw, he continued

   machine gun.

   ACHIET-LE-GRAND, 21st to 23rd August, 1918. For conspicuous
   gallantry and good leadership. He led his platoon in an attack
   with great skill to the final objective in spite of heavy
   machine-gun fire. When the flanks were exposed and a withdrawal
   became necessary, he maintained his position for two hours
   over a thousand yards in advance of the new line covering the
   withdrawal, and then brought back his men in perfect order. In a
   later attack he captured all his objectives and took command of
   a large number of troops who had lost their leaders. The success
   achieved was largely due to his courage and coolness.


GUTTRIDGE, 2/Lt. John Frederick                                9/Yorks

   Awarded 1st January, 1919.

   covered them with a Lewis gun and went out himself and brought
   both back prisoners.

   FORET DE NIEPPE, 28th June, 1918. Soon after the commencement
   of an important attack this officer went well forward
   and established a signal station, from which he kept up
   communication between battalion headquarters and the companies,
   notwithstanding the heavy enemy shell fire, which constantly
   broke the wires. His personal courage and coolness under trying
   circumstances were a fine example to his men, and he sent back
   valuable information from his position in the front line.


HALL, Capt. Alner Wilson                                     1/Artists

   Awarded 3rd June, 1919.

   Near VERMELLES, 28th September, 1915. For conspicuous
   gallantry at the quarries. He led his bombers and threw bombs

HALLIDAY, 2/Lt. Clarence Peter                        2/Yorkshire L.I.

   FAYET, 14th April, 1917. He led his platoon with great skill

   counter-attack, thereby rendering valuable assistance at a
   critical period.

   ASIAGO PLATEAU, ITALY, 10/11 October, 1918. For conspicuous
   courage and determination during a night raid on enemy trenches
   at Sec. In spite of the darkness and a heavy enemy barrage, he
   led his men straight to the final objective, where he engaged
   the enemy with great gallantry. An enemy machine gun opened fire
   on his party at close range; he at once, with only a few men,
   rushed the gun, putting the team out of action, and brought the
   gun back to his lines.


HALLOWES, 2/Lt. Rupert Price                               4/Middlesex

   HOOGE, 19th July, 1915. For conspicuous gallantry on the night
   of 19th July, when owing to shortage of bombs the enemy was
   advancing down the communication trench. He got out of his
   trench, exposing himself fearlessly, and fired at the enemy in
   the open, hitting several. He also assisted in making a block,
   dug out a communication trench under heavy shell fire, and
   rebuilt a parapet that had been blown in. Throughout the night
   he assisted in keeping touch and supplying bombs.

   conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He has on many
   occasions displayed the utmost dash and fearlessness in

   engaging enemy aircraft at close range, and has succeeded
   in destroying a considerable number. He also attacked with
   machine-gun fire, and from low altitudes, enemy formations on
   the ground, and dropped bombs on points of importance behind the
   hostile lines. He has invariably shown great determination and a

   showed great courage and initiative, and his contempt of danger
   had a great effect on his men.

   E. of NIEUPORT, 10th July, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty when in charge of the maintenance of canal

   of 15/16 October, when in face of considerable difficulties and
   hostile fire, he got his company over the HAUTE DEULE CANAL.
   For this purpose he made a rough raft himself, was the first

   and ability in an attack, and drove the enemy, with many
   casualties, from the position where he was holding up our
   advance. At one time his men were practically surrounded and
   under heavy fire, through which he rushed without hesitation to
   warn an advancing battalion of the position of his company. He
   averted what might have been a most unfortunate accident by his
   promptitude and disregard of danger.

   been expended. His courage and endurance were a splendid example
   to his men.


HAWKSWORTH, 2/Lt. Henry Charles Harold                        10/Essex

   YPRES, 31st July, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and devotion
   to duty. When the two assaulting battalions of an attack were
   short of ammunition and it was of the utmost importance that
   a fresh supply should reach them as soon as possible, he led
   an ammunition party forward about two-and-a-half miles over
   the most difficult country, exposed the whole time to the
   heaviest shell fire and without a guide. One third of his party
   were knocked out, but he safely delivered the ammunition, and
   hearing on his return journey that a hostile counter-attack was
   probable, he turned his party about and again reported to the
   battalion headquarters in case his aid should be required. His
   determination and devotion to duty set a splendid example to his
   party.

   example throughout that greatly inspired and encouraged his men.

   good leader of men.

   during an enemy attack. Throughout the fighting he maintained

   valuable information. When the front line was broken he held
   up the enemy with Lewis gun fire, and by constant patrolling
   kept touch with the division on his right, closing up a very
   wide gap in the second line. He showed great fearlessness, and
   by reinforcing his threatened flank undoubtedly prevented the
   enemy’s further advance.


HILL, 2/Lt. Arthur Dudley                                  1/Middlesex

   which he captured, killing three of the enemy. Being wounded,

   charge of an important advanced post had become a casualty, he
   immediately went up through a heavy barrage and took command.
   He organised and controlled the fire of the garrison with such
   effect that the enemy began to waver, so he promptly advanced,
   inflicting severe casualties; but, finding them too numerous, he
   withdrew, after ascertaining their dispositions. His courage and
   coolness throughout the whole operations were very marked.

IMRIE, 2/Lt. David Patrick Cuthbert                           1/London

   WARNETON, 9th April, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. He was in charge of a platoon occupying a
   strong point, and after both flanks had been forced back he
   held on and inflicted very heavy casualties on the enemy at
   close range, thus delaying the enemy’s advance and allowing the
   troops, which had withdrawn, to take up a new position. His
   tireless energy and cheerfulness deserve the highest praise.

IRELAND, 2/Lt. Ernest Pinnock                               Tank Corps

   Near ST. JULIEN, 22nd August, 1917. When acting in support
   of another officer, the tank commanded by the latter became
   ditched, whereupon 2/Lt. Ireland attempted to tow it out with
   his own, but got ditched in the attempt. He unditched his own
   tank and brought all the wounded and the guns of both tanks
   safely out of action, although while doing so his tank was put
   out of action by shell fire. During the whole of this time, he
   was under heavy shell and machine-gun fire. He showed great
   gallantry and fearlessness.


IRVING, Capt. George Gray Hammond                      9/Rifle Brigade

   ACHIET-LE-GRAND, 21st to 25th August, 1918. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty. He made a personal
   reconnaissance of the outpost line under heavy machine-gun fire,
   and returned with information of great importance. During five
   days’ operations he was untiring in his efforts to arrange food,
   water and ammunition supplies, and by his masterly grip of the
   situation rendered invaluable service.


JACKSON, Capt. Mark Keith                                    6/Warwick

   E. of VILLERS PLOUICH, 3rd to 5th December, 1917. For
   conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in action. Although
   in a very exposed position with his company, he maintained it
   for many hours under a very heavy shell fire. Later, seeing
   a company of another unit on his left being hard pressed, he
   gallantly led a party of men across the open to attack the enemy
   on the flank, and was wounded while so doing.

                              BAR TO M.C.

   BAC ST. MAUR, 6th September, 1917. He organised the final attack
   which drove the enemy out of his positions with great skill, and
   carried it out with courage and determination, capturing many
   prisoners and four machine guns. His conspicuous courage and
   devotion to duty inspired all the men of the company under his
   command.


JACKSON, 2/Lt. Stewart Spiers                              6/Worcester

   LA VACQUERIE, 3rd December, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. When sent up with reinforcements to a post
   which was almost surrounded by the enemy he led his men through
   heavy rifle and machine-gun fire. He went forward alone to
   reconnoitre the best means of approach, and by his coolness and
   courage succeeded in bringing timely assistance to the garrison
   of the post.


JAGGER, Lieut. Charles Sargeant                           13/Worcester

   NEUVE EGLISE, 11th to 14th April, 1918. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty while commanding a company. He
   beat off several attacks by superior forces, and when his right
   flank was exposed and communication cut he still held on to
   his position. He made a valiant fight, and not until he was
   compelled to do so did he order a retirement.


JAMES, 2/Lt. Lawrence Edward                                  7/London

   S.E. of YPRES, 20th September, 1917. When the advance of his
   company was held up by enfilade fire from a dug-out he quickly
   made up a party, and after hard fighting captured the position,
   accounting for eight of the enemy. His prompt action was
   invaluable to the battalion.


JAMES, 2/Lt. William Thomas                                   1/London

   N.W. of BULLECOURT, 16th June, 1917. He took command of his
   company when his other officers had become casualties, and
   consolidated and held a position for 24 hours, although
   subjected to repeated bombing attacks and sniping from all
   sides. His conduct and bearing throughout were most creditable,
   and set a splendid example to his men.


JARVIS, Captain Arthur                                    1/Gloucester

   Awarded 3rd June, 1919.


JEFFERYS, Capt. Arthur Harold         7/Middlesex (Loyal North Lancs.)

   GIVENCHY, 18th April, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. As soon as the enemy barrage lifted
   he ordered his company to stand to, and when he found that
   the enemy had penetrated the trenches he led an immediate
   counter-attack and drove them back some distance. He then
   organised and led bombing parties to clear the enemy out, and
   join up with a company on the left. He succeeded in this, and,
   although wounded, insisted on reorganising the sector, and did
   not leave till the next day.


JERWOOD, Capt. Edward Longsden                           1/Royal Berks

   S. of RICHEBOURG L’AVOUE, May 15th, 1915. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty during a night attack on the
   enemy’s trenches, when in charge of machine guns. He established
   a machine gun in position in the second captured German
   trench under rifle and machine-gun fire, and also recovered a
   machine gun that had been lost between the first and second
   German trenches. On 17th May he gallantly led a section which
   established two machine guns in the firing line under shell
   fire, and set a fine example to the men under his command.

                           FIRST BAR TO M.C.

   Near OPPY, 29th April, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty in leading his company during an attack. By his
   dispositions and personal example he was able to repulse several
   heavy counter-attacks until himself wounded. The reports he sent
   back were invaluable.

                          SECOND BAR TO M.C.

   Near BERMERAIN, 24th October, 1918. For marked gallantry and
   devotion to duty. When in command of the support company he
   noticed that the left front company and the battalion on his
   left were held up by heavy enfilade machine-gun fire. He
   promptly advanced his company and captured the final objective.


JERWOOD, Capt. John Hugh                                10/Durham L.I.

   S.E of HOOGE, 21/22 and 24/25 August, 1917. He maintained his
   position regardless of withdrawals on his right and left and
   of the fact that the enemy had penetrated the line on both his
   flanks. He displayed a coolness and fearlessness which inspired
   all ranks with confidence.


JOHNSON, Capt. Alfred Forbes                                    R.G.A.

   Awarded 1st January, 1919.


OHNSON, Capt. Charles Beckett                   5/Border (9/Liverpool)

   Awarded 3rd June, 1919.


JOHNSTON, 2/Lt. John Darrell                              5/Gloucester

   E. of YPRES, 22nd August, 1917. During the attack he led his
   company through the barrage and took up and consolidated a
   position. He took command of the forward line and organised
   the defence of four different units. He displayed exceptional
   qualities of leadership, and by his cheerfulness and disregard
   of danger inspired all ranks to consolidate and hold on at a
   critical time. His organisation of the line helped the troops on
   his flanks to hold on to the objectives.


JOHNSTONE, Lieut. Robert                             4/London (R.F.C.)

   Near LE TRANSLOY, 17th October, 1916. For conspicuous
   gallantry in action. He has shown marked courage and initiative
   in turning our artillery on to columns of enemy infantry. On one
   occasion he carried out counter battery work in cloud and mist
   at 800 feet under heavy fire from the ground.


JONES, Lieut. Percy Hudson                                        R.E.

   FESTUBERT, 18th April, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. As brigade signalling officer he displayed
   untiring energy in his efforts to establish communication
   with battalions which had become dislocated owing to heavy
   bombardment and mist. Throughout the day he was up and down
   seeing what could be done to improve matters, regardless of
   personal risk.


JONES, 2/Lt. Reginald Lucas                                   9/London

   Near WESTHOEK, 16th August, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty on several occasions in hand-to-hand fighting.
   On one occasion he cleared a tunnel dug-out with a Lewis gun,
   inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.


JOSEPHS, 2/Lt. Edward Albert Robert                       5/Gloucester

   S. of POELCAPPELLE, 4th October, 1917. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty. He took command of his company
   in an attack and led it forward under heavy fire. He showed
   great initiative and energy in organising and consolidating the
   captured ground.


JUPP, Lieut. John Morton Scott                           10/Manchester

   BRIASTRE, 20th October, 1918. For marked gallantry and
   determined leadership. He was in command of a company, and under
   heavy machine-gun fire, dashed forward with a few men, shooting
   several of the enemy with his rifle and capturing the guns.
   Later, finding that the company on his flank had not reached its
   objective, he led a platoon and attacked the enemy on his flank.


JULL, 2/Lt. Robert Charles                                      R.G.A.

   Awarded 1st January, 1918.


JUNGIUS, Lieut. Ernest James Theodore               1/Bedford (M.G.C.)

   Awarded 3rd June, 1918.


KEEP, 2/Lt. Alan Ralph                             3/Royal West Surrey

   OVILLERS, 27th July and 13th August, 1916. For conspicuous
   gallantry during operations. He kept his battery continually in
   action day and night under heavy shell fire, thereby materially
   assisting the infantry to capture enemy trenches.


KEEY, Lieut. Cecil Walter                                     7/London

   SAULCOURT and EPEHY, 7th September, 1918. For conspicuous
   courage and devotion to duty during the operations. He was in
   charge of two mobile trench mortars, and had both guns put out
   of action, and the majority of the teams wounded. Despite the
   fact that he was wounded in the face he took over the remnants
   of two companies of infantry who were left without an officer
   and reorganised them, and consolidated on a line just west of
   CAPRON COPSE. His initiative and courage in the face of great
   danger were a splendid example to all ranks concerned.


KEKEWICH, 2/Lt. Stanley Buck                                    R.F.A.

   LA VACQUERIE, 30th November, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. He assisted his battery commander in
   man-handling the guns back when the ammunition was exhausted
   during an enemy attack. He set a splendid example of coolness
   and courage under heavy fire.


KELTY, Lieut. Stanley William                  9/Liverpool (30/M.G.C.)

   WERVICQ, 14th October, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   initiative. During the attack he twice went forward to
   reconnoitre the ground prior to the advance of his guns. When
   an enemy post was holding up our advance he crept forward to
   ascertain the strength with which it was held. He obtained most
   useful information concerning the enemy’s position, although
   persistently fired at by snipers and machine guns. Later, he
   took his guns boldly forward and had them in their consolidated
   positions within half an hour of the capture of the locality.


KENNEDY, Lieut. Cyril Arthur Reginald              R.F.A. (Y/9/T.M.B.)

   Near STEENBEEK, 15th October, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. He was in charge of mobile 6-in. mortar
   in close support of the infantry. When the attack began heavy
   enemy machine-gun fire was immediately opened on the mortar and
   its detachment. With great coolness and gallantry he continued
   to keep his mortar firing and render very material assistance in
   diminishing the enemy’s fire, and thus enabling the infantry to
   continue their advance.


KERCKHOVE, 2/Lt. Herbert Vincent                         4/East Surrey

   HAUSSY, 16th October, 1918. For gallantry and resourceful
   leading during the attack. After several attempts had failed
   to rescue a wounded man who was lying in front of our posts
   he crept out under heavy machine-gun fire and got the man in.
   Later, he organised a party of 10 men and surrounded an enemy
   post in a sunken road, which was inflicting great damage and
   casualties upon the attacking force, and succeeded in capturing
   the whole garrison of 60, with two trench mortars and two
   anti-tank rifles. His courage and coolness were admirable.


KERR, 2/Lt. John Vass                                         7/London

   Near HANGARD, 24th April, 1918. This officer’s platoon was
   subjected to very heavy fire during an enemy attack, which drove
   back the troops on either flank. His determination encouraged
   his platoon to stand fast and pour a steady fire into the
   advancing enemy, causing them to bring up a large number of
   troops, supported by two tanks, against him. Although his
   men began to waver, he went round the platoon, regardless of
   personal danger, and rallied them at the critical moment by his
   example, so that not one of the enemy reached his post. But for
   his gallant stand a considerable amount of ground would have
   been lost.


KIDD, Lieut. Claude Bernard                                15/Cheshire

   Near EPEHY, 24th August, 1917. He did remarkably fine work
   when his company was holding a position for many hours from
   early morning till late at night, while heavily shelled. It was
   entirely due to his efforts that the men were kept together. He
   encouraged his men throughout the day, continually going up and
   down the trench. His conduct was splendid, and he set a fine
   example.


KING, 2/Lt. Bernand Ellis                                   10/Norfolk

   Awarded 1st January, 1918.


KING, 2/Lt. Harry Norman                      4/Loyal North Lancashire

   Near CORDONNERIE, 29th July, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty when leading his platoon in a raid on the
   enemy trenches. After fierce hand-to-hand fighting, in which
   his platoon sergeant and four section leaders were all wounded,
   an enemy party superior in numbers appeared on his right. He
   at once collected his men, charged this party, and in a second
   hand-to-hand fight put them to flight. Although half his platoon
   had become casualties he remained out in “No Man’s Land” until
   ordered to retire, when he collected wounded and brought them
   in. His absolute contempt of danger and fine leadership so
   inspired his men that they completely routed a force of twice
   their strength.


KINGDON, 2/Lt. Frank Denys                         29th Battery R.F.A.

   SAPIGNIES, 25th August, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry. When
   heavy enemy fire killed two men and wounded several others of
   his battery he organised a stretcher party and got them to a
   place of safety under heavy shelling. By his example of coolness
   he kept the battery in action and saved several lives. Later,
   while observing under heavy enfilade fire, he showed marked
   devotion to duty, and kept up communication with his battery by
   visual, and got back valuable information.

KNIGHT, 2/Lt. Alfred Ovenden                 12/Loyal North Lancashire

   GOUZEAUCOURT, 30th November, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. During the preliminary portion of the attack
   he showed great courage and exercised complete control over
   his company. On the enemy opening a heavy barrage, and while
   they were seen to be advancing, he ordered all the sections
   with which he could get into touch to retire, only leaving the
   position himself when the enemy were not more than 300 yards
   away. It was very largely due to his courage and skill that the
   whole company were extricated from a very awkward situation with
   very few casualties.


KNOWLES, 2/Lt. Roland Ernest                                    R.G.A.

   N.W. of HEBUTERNE, 5th April, 1918. Whilst on duty at the guns
   under heavy enemy bombardment he helped to rescue the wounded
   from a blown-in dug-out. He kept all the guns in action, moved
   from pit to pit with the greatest coolness, and personally
   assisted in serving the guns when short of men. He displayed
   fine courage, and set a high example by his behaviour.


LAING, 2/Lt. Ivan                                    Coldstream Guards

   Near GINCHY, 15/16 September, 1916. When he was the only officer
   left in his company, he reorganised his men, rushed forward
   through a heavy barrage, and remained out securing the front
   till ordered to withdraw.


LAMBERT, 2/Lt. Philip Felix                              2/West Riding

   FAMPOUX, 9th to 11th April, 1917. He displayed great courage and
   resource in taking command of his company in the advance. When
   the party was withdrawn at night he did good work in organising
   the defence of a captured trench; he set a fine example
   throughout.


LAMBDIN, Lieut. John Reginald             7/West Yorks (2/Durham L.I.)

   Near ST. QUENTIN WOOD. For marked gallantry and devotion to duty
   on the night of 17/18 September, 1918. He was sent to show the
   battalion guides the route to the assembly position. He took the
   party up and got shelled. Out of sixteen guides six came back,
   the remainder being killed. Although himself badly shaken, he
   returned to the battalion and, practically unaided, guided the
   companies into position. He then volunteered to take a message
   over ground swept by shell fire.


LAST, Capt. Ernest Reginald                                1/Liverpool

   VIMY RIDGE, 1/2 June, 1916. For conspicuous gallantry. He
   organised an assault on the enemy’s trenches, and displayed
   great coolness and an utter disregard of personal danger during
   the operation, which was carried out under a heavy hostile
   bombardment.


LAWLESS, Capt. Philip Henry                               18/Middlesex

   Awarded 1st January, 1919.


LEE, Capt. Reginald William                                    4/Essex

   ALI-EL-MUNTAR, EGYPT, 26th March, 1917. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty. During an attack he went back
   under heavy machine gun and rifle fire at close range, collected
   and brought up reinforcements regardless of his own safety. He
   then organised and skilfully led the final assault from his part
   of the line.


LEECH, Lieut. Arthur William                6/Northumberland Fusiliers

   Near HARBONNIERES, 27th March, 1918. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty. During a counter-attack, when
   his commanding officer had become a casualty, he took command
   of the battalion and successfully led the attack to its
   objective, capturing two machine-guns and several prisoners.
   This successful counter-attack was instrumental in holding up
   the enemy at a critical moment, and great praise was due to this
   officer.


LE FEVRE, 2/Lt. Frank Ewart Bayliss                          3/Lincoln

   S.W. of LENS, 1st July, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty during an assault upon the enemy’s position.
   When the leading company was temporarily checked he pressed
   forward, killing many of the enemy, and personally taking a
   prisoner. When he could go no further he dug in. He afterwards
   made it his special mission to keep touch between the right and
   left companies, repeatedly passing over ground which was under
   fire, and showing a complete contempt for danger. His consistent
   coolness under fire has always set a magnificent example to his
   men.


LEITH, Lieut. George Hector                       18/Machine Gun Corps

   FORET DE MORMAL, 4th November, 1918. During the attack he
   handled his section of machine guns with great courage and skill
   under heavy machine-gun fire, enabling them to select positions
   of great value, from whence they were able to inflict heavy
   casualties on the enemy, as well as to neutralise the enemy’s
   fire, and materially assisted the advance of the infantry. He
   has consistently done good work.


LEWIS, Capt. Francis Attwater                                  5/Welch

   Awarded 11th April, 1918.

   S.E. of La CLYTTE, 8/9 August, 1918. For conspicuous
   gallantry and good leadership. He was the first to reach the
   objective on the front of the company of which he was in
   command. When the position had been gained he consolidated with
   skill and promptitude, in spite of many casualties, sending back
   valuable information to battalion headquarters. Throughout the
   operation his fine example had a great effect on his men.


LINDSAY, Lieut. Gordon Parmiter                               2/Border

   Near BAPAUME, January, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. He displayed great courage and initiative
   during a raid, and was the last to leave the enemy’s front line
   trench. Later he made a gallant attempt to rescue a wounded man.


LISTER, 2/Lt. Alfred Walton                                     R.F.A.

   FLEURBAIX, 9th April, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. When the battery position was being heavily
   shelled he helped to keep up the fire of his battery by running
   from one gun to another, passing orders. When the order was
   given to limber up he helped with the teams so that the guns
   were got away under shell and machine-gun fire. He worked day
   and night when he and another officer were the only two left
   with the battery, inspiring all ranks to do their utmost.


LLOYD-JONES, Lieut. John                                   2/Yorkshire

   Awarded 1st January, 1916.

   EGYPT, 19th September, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and

   S.W. of ASIAGO, 15th June, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty during an enemy attack. When his company
   commander had been killed he, though wounded in the head,
   commanded the company throughout the day, and only went to the
   Aid Post when ordered to do so by the commanding officer in the
   evening. He set a very fine example of grit and perseverance to
   his men.


LONGSTAFF, Capt. Ralph                                    8/East Yorks

   Awarded 1st January, 1917.


LORD, 2/Lt. Gilbert Henry                            5/Royal Lancaster

   gallantry and ability in action. He and a N.C.O. went out to the
   help of a fighting patrol who had suffered severe casualties. He
   promptly organised stretcher parties, and made many journeys to
   and from the front line under heavy machine-gun fire, himself
   unaided carrying one man 100 yards. When all casualties were
   clear he twice attempted to rescue the Lewis gun and was wounded

   devotion to duty at the crossing of the OISE-SAMBRE CANAL.
   He carried out personal reconnaissance, and pushed his guns
   boldly forward before the attack. During the attack he opened
   an intense fire on enemy machine guns, and swept the points
   from which the bridging parties could be fired on. This made it
   possible for the canal to be bridged very quickly.

   YPRES, 31st July, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. He rendered most valuable assistance to the
   infantry, and when his tank had become badly ditched under
   heavy shell fire he formed two strong points with his crew, and
   kept them supplied with ammunition until he was wounded. He
   remained with his men in one of these strong points for over
   an hour, until he became so weak from loss of blood that the
   crew persuaded him to go back to the dressing station. He set a
   splendid example of pluck and devotion to duty.

   coolness and initiative.

                              BAR TO M.C.

   with the knowledge gained, he led his platoon round the first,
   killing the garrison, and then rushed the second. The same night
   he drove out nest after nest of machine-guns with his platoon,
   his energetic leadership inspiring his men with great confidence.

   gallantry and devotion to duty. When all the other officers of
   his company had become casualties he took command, and led them
   with the greatest gallantry and skill during the severe fighting
   which ensued, returning after the capture of each strong point
   and collecting more men, whom he led forward. While doing this
   gallant work he fell severely wounded in the head, having very
   materially assisted in the capture of the position.

   WESTHOEK RIDGE, 10th August, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. When in charge of the battalion carrying
   and ration parties he carried out his work with the greatest
   coolness and ability, and although by reason of the heavy shell
   fire it was of a most arduous and dangerous nature it was due
   to his exertions and personal supervision that rations arrived
   regularly. On another occasion during an attack he led his men
   forward with great coolness, setting a fine example to those
   around him. He afterwards took over and reorganised another
   company whose officers had all become casualties.


MACDONALD, Lieut. Kenneth                      7/Seaforth Highlanders

   conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He always showed
   great initiative and skill in attacking enemy aircraft, and
   drove down or destroyed several enemy machines. On one occasion
   while on patrol he encountered three enemy two-seater machines,
   and though his engine was giving trouble he attacked them
   single-handed and drove one of them down out of control, having
   shot the observer. On another occasion, after driving down an
   enemy machine, he attacked and silenced a battery of six guns
   which were firing on our machines. His example of pluck and
   determination was of the utmost value to the squadron.

   Near ZONNEBEKE, 23rd October, 1917. On a wireless station being
   blown in by hostile shell fire he organised a rescue party from
   his platoon, which was quartered in adjacent dug-outs. In spite

   and had them carried back to a dressing station. By his prompt
   action and fine example of courage the lives of these men were
   saved.

   and devotion to duty during an intense hostile bombardment of
   the town. He occupied the brigade observation post, which was
   unprotected, and at the top of a conspicuously high building,
   for twelve hours under intense shell fire. His work enabled
   the brigade commander to keep in touch with the situation, as
   all other means of doing so were being continually interrupted,
   and in spite of the shells bursting all round his post and
   passing through the building he declined to vacate it, except
   to repair his telephone wires. He set a magnificent example of
   fearlessness and devotion to duty.


MACKAY, 2/Lt. Donald John Everall                                 R.E.

   LA BASSEE CANAL, 18th April, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. When the enemy was seen massing in force
   at the head of a pontoon bridge, in spite of the shelling and
   machine-gun fire, he and his men swung and sank the bridge,
   and then assisted the garrison to man the trenches and repulse
   the enemy. Undoubtedly his coolness and resource under most
   difficult conditions saved what might have been a serious
   situation.

   CHAUNY, 21st March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. His section was under intense shell fire, and
   he found it impossible to keep the communication line working,
   so he established a post in the open, and from there maintained
   connection all day with the brigade, and got messages through to
   the section by runners. He was wounded in the evening.


MACKIE, Lieut. William Gordon                            5/West Riding

   KEMMEL, 27th April, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. This officer personally reconnoitred under
   heavy machine-gun fire the whole front of the battalion, which
   had been ordered to advance at short notice, without having had
   an opportunity of examining the ground beforehand. When the
   flank was threatened the reserve company of which he was in
   command was pushed into the gap, and he made able dispositions
   of his platoons and Stokes and Vickers guns. Under heavy fire
   he crawled forward and secured maps and papers from wounded and
   dead enemy in front of our lines. Later, when fifty of the enemy
   endeavoured to rush one of his posts, he turned a Lewis gun on
   them and accounted for them all. He was severely wounded--losing
   an eye while doing this--but he did not desist until the enemy
   was completely repulsed. His gallantry and initiative were
   conspicuous throughout the day, during the whole of which he was
   under close machine-gun fire.

   devotion to duty while in charge of the guns of a battery who
   were covering the withdrawal of a division. The battery was
   under heavy machine-gun fire at a range of about 900 yards. He

   then withdrew them successfully. On this occasion he behaved
   with the greatest coolness, and all through the operations
   showed great courage and energy.

   accomplished his task, enfilading the enemy’s position and

   AYETTE, 14/15 July, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry in
   leading his company in a raid against the enemy outpost system,
   when nine prisoners were captured and as many more killed. The
   success was due to his very thorough all-night reconnaissances.
   He showed the calmest determination, and his personal example
   inspired a fine offensive spirit in the men he took over the
   parapet.

   leadership and gallantry when in command of a company. Again,

   was detached from the battalion, he showed great initiative in

   his company captured eight machine guns and over 50 prisoners
   was largely due to his fine courage and leadership in mopping-up
   dug-outs and enemy snipers.

   observation of the enemy, he arranged a tow rope himself and
   took the disabled tank in tow. He was heavily shelled for some
   distance, but brought the broken-down tank back to its rallying
   point, a distance of about 7,000 yards.


MAXWELL, 2/Lt. George Barton                      32/Machine Gun Corps

   Near SEQUEHART, 1st October, 1918. For great courage and
   initiative in the fighting on this date. When the enemy
   counter-attacked and our infantry were driven back, he kept his
   guns going till he was practically surrounded and our barrage
   had fallen behind him. He then fought his way out, and with his
   revolver put out of action five of the enemy who attacked him.
   During a second counter-attack he stayed in action till the
   last, and then helped to form a new line and held it with his
   guns assisted by infantry he had helped to collect. Later, he
   beat off a further local counter-attack with his guns. By his
   personal courage and example to his men he rendered the greatest
   service.

   under enemy shell fire, which killed three of his men and
   wounded six, besides killing five horses. Though badly shaken he
   organised a party and cleared the road, and brought his gun and
   wagons to the position with the least possible delay. He showed
   great pluck and determination.

[MESSOM, 2/Lt. Harold                             2/Royal West Surrey]

   _In the London Gazette of 23rd June, 1915, an award of M.C.,
   intended for 2/Lt. Messom, who had been mentioned in Despatches,
   for gallant conduct in February 1915, was by a clerical error
   published in the name of another officer in his Regiment of very
   similar name. On the mistake being discovered, that notification
   was cancelled. But in the meantime 2/Lt. Messom had been killed
   in action, and it is understood that the error could not be
   further rectified as at that date posthumous awards (except of
   V.C.) were inadmissible._ ED.

   When the troops on the left were heavily counter-attacked, he
   crossed about 200 yards of open ground under heavy fire, rallied

   LANNOY, 4th May, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and devotion
   to duty. At dawn the enemy commenced a heavy bombardment on the

   decided to withdraw the detachments to a place of safety. While

   his head, bringing the brickwork on the top of him and burying
   him. He crawled out, trying to get to the guns, when another
   shell burst close by, again burying him. He managed to crawl
   out, and though much shaken, got to the guns and superintended
   their withdrawal. The bombardment continued for an hour, and it

   gallantry and devotion to duty during an enemy attack. Finding
   that the enemy were occupying the trench immediately on his
   flank, he made an effective bomb block, and at the same time

   forced the enemy completely out of the support system. His

   bombing attacks up DUNCAN AVENUE and POT LANE, which enabled him
   to get in touch with units on both flanks and clean up a large
   body of the enemy.

   them from advancing further than the front line. He then made
   a daring reconnaissance under heavy machine-gun fire, and,
   organising a counter-attack, drove the enemy out again from one
   of the points. The next day he counter-attacked the other point,
   and succeeded in completely restoring the line.

   conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. In an assault on a

   dashing leadership. This officer was detailed to mop-up part
   of the village. Although badly held up by enemy machine-gun
   fire he led his platoon on and showed great initiative, and set
   a splendid example by rushing two enemy machine guns, which
   he captured, killing the crews of both. In the attempt he was
   wounded, but carried on until his platoon had completed its
   task, and were definitely established on the objective.

   Later, while still ahead, he silenced another machine gun and
   took the crew prisoners. He was in action for seven hours and
   set a splendid example of courage and devotion to duty.


PEAL, Lieut. Arthur Francis Henry    5/York & Lancaster (148th T.M.B.)

   YPRES, 28/29 June, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and devotion
   to duty while in charge of two mortars which were taken out
   into “No Man’s Land” during a raid on the enemy’s trenches.

   one mortar became useless owing to a damaged striker. He
   personally remedied the defect and brought the mortar into
   action again immediately. By his fine example of coolness and
   determination he kept his mortars firing exactly to time, each
   of which expended 80 rounds.

                              BAR TO M.C.

   HASPRES, 13th October, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry in action

   mountings were missing through casualties, he continued to fire
   the mortars until forced to withdraw.

   and devotion to duty. After the battalion had launched a
   counter-attack he pushed forward to a very advanced position
   and sent back excellent reports containing most valuable

   who had been driven back, and re-establishing a line. In these
   operations he was wounded.

   Near CROISILLES, 27th August, 1918. He carried out a
   reconnaissance on the flank of the battalion with great skill,
   and obtained such successful results that, owing to his
   information, the artillery were able to concentrate on a large
   body of enemy who were assembling for a counter-attack, and
   dispersed them with very heavy loss. He was later on wounded in
   three places by the explosion of a shell as he was attacking
   a machine gun that was causing casualties. His gallantry and
   ability were conspicuous and he rendered most valuable service.

   forward two of his platoons into the ROUVROY-FRESNES line, and
   led them through advanced troops which were hung up and captured
   a further 1,000 yards of the line. He himself rushed two machine
   guns which were enfilading our troops, and captured seventeen
   prisoners. His splendid example, courage and leadership enabled
   touch to be gained all along the line. Later in the evening he
   himself pushed forward into Neuvireul and captured two heavy
   trench mortars which had been causing many casualties to the
   battalion on his left.


PULLINGER, 2/Lt. Charles Edward                             7/K.R.R.C.

   cables this officer and his party were confronted with a very
   heavy hostile barrage and intense machine-gun fire. With great
   determination he pushed on with four men and succeeded in
   getting his telephone lines across a river. His personal courage
   and perseverance set a splendid example to his party, and it was
   entirely due to his disregard of his own safety that the work
   was successfully carried out, the party being under heavy fire
   all the time. He was severely wounded whilst engaged on this
   duty.

   with its engine damaged. Later, he attacked one of five enemy
   two-seater machines, and drove it down out of control. He has
   destroyed in all three enemy machines and driven three others
   down out of control. He continually attacked enemy troops and

   and devotion to duty. During a night air raid this officer was
   in charge of the workshops and technical stores dump, next to
   a large ammunition dump and kite-balloon depot. At 10 p.m. two
   fires were started by bombs in the ammunition dump. With the
   exception of the anti-aircraft machine-gun crew, all men were
   sent to safety. Violent explosions on the dump filled the air
   with shells and fragments, and the camp was continually bombed
   by the light of the fire. He sent all the machine-gun crew away,
   and fired the two machine guns himself until they both jammed.
   Later a fire broke out in the balloon shed, which he helped
   to extinguish, saving a great deal of valuable material. He
   worked continuously for five hours under continuous bombing and
   explosives.

   out daring patrols of the enemy’s wire, and the success of a
   raiding party was largely due to his information.

   field battery opened fire at about 100 yards range. Though one
   tank was put out of action, and he was severely wounded, he
   effectively silenced the battery, and enabled the infantry to
   continue the advance. He set a splendid example to all ranks.


RICHARDS, Lieut. Lincoln Winfield               5/Lincoln (12/Norfolk)

   VIEUX BERQUIN, 19th August, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty during an attack. He rushed an enemy post,
   shooting the officer and putting the remainder to flight. He
   was the first to reach the final objective, cheering on and
   encouraging his men. His courage and leadership inspired his men
   at critical stages of the attack.


RICKATSON, 2/Lt. Hugh Cecil               1/Artists: Coldstream Guards

   GOUZEAUCOURT, 30th November, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. When his company had to remain under fire
   in the open during an attack while a flanking movement was
   being carried out his example of coolness and courage was an
   inspiration to his men. On arriving at the objective, though
   wounded, he superintended the consolidation of the position
   under intense fire.


RICKWOOD, 2/Lt. John Edgell                              5/Royal Berks

   Near DOURGES, 15th October, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   initiative. He volunteered to cross the HAUTE DEULE CANAL and
   make a reconnaissance. After crossing the canal at PONT-A-SAULT
   his presence was discovered by the enemy, who kept him covered
   with their machine guns. In spite of this he worked his way
   along the eastern bank of the canal and brought back most
   valuable information, which enabled his company to form a
   bridgehead.


RIDLINGTON, Lieut. Alfred Charles   17th Armoured Car Bn. (Tank Corps)

   LE CATEAU-MARETZ ROAD, 9th October, 1918. He displayed
   marked gallantry and skill when in charge of a section of
   armoured cars. He first attacked a machine-gun post which was
   holding up our advance, and, in conjunction with the infantry,
   successfully cleared it and captured the guns. In proceeding
   forward with two cars a bridge was blown up behind him by the
   enemy, separating him from the second car and from our troops.
   With one car, however, he went forward through Maurois and
   Honnechy, which were both strongly held by the enemy, of whom he
   killed five in one spot in the latter village. His prompt action
   prevented the railway bridge from being blown up by the enemy.

   in great danger from an explosion.

                                 4/Gloucester (7/Lancashire Fusiliers)

   E. of HEBUTERNE and BEAUREGARD DOVECOTE, 21st to 23rd August,
   1918. For conspicuous gallantry during an attack. He led the
   attack on a position and successfully checked the enemy’s
   counter-attack. Finding his right flank in the air he attacked
   the enemy in a trench on his right flank, and in conjunction
   with another company captured an officer and about 90 other
   ranks. He showed great courage and ability to command.


ROBERTS, Lieut. Frederick Arthur Donkin        18/Lancashire Fusiliers

   VIJEWEGEN, 14th October, 1918. During the operations south-west
   of LEDEGHEM and subsequent operations south of GULLEGHEM he
   was conspicuous for his gallant and skilful leadership. In
   the attack south of MOORSEELE, when hostile machine guns were
   holding up the advance, he led his men forward and secured
   valuable positions and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.


ROBERTS, 2/Lt. Henry                       7/West Yorks (1/East Yorks)

   Near LIMONT FONTAINE, 7th November, 1918. During the
   operations he showed fine and determined leadership. When the
   advance of his battalion was held up by machine-gun fire he took
   command of two platoons, and led them forward, working round
   the enemy’s flanks, and causing him to retire and abandon his
   machine guns. Later he led another attack on a machine gun.


ROBERTS, 2/Lt. John                                             R.F.A.

   Near YPRES, 25th November, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. He was in charge of a party building a gun
   position, and when they were heavily shelled he ordered the men
   to take cover. When one of the party was severely wounded he
   and one man went back, and though twice knocked down by shells
   succeeded in carrying him to cover.


ROBERTSON, 2/Lt. Albert                                   7/Shropshire

   Near HEKIN and HENINEL, 21st to 28th March, 1918. For
   conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in leading his
   platoon. On several occasions he withstood determined enemy
   attacks under intense bombardment, successfully directing his
   platoon when compelled to withdraw.


ROBERTSON, 2/Lt. Frank Bruce                               1/Leicester

   QUADRILATERAL, 15/16 September, 1916. He performed most
   valuable work requiring great courage, twice passing through a

   fine work.

   MARESCHES, 1st November, 1918. For great gallantry and good
   work. He advanced with his platoon to the RIVER RHONELLE,
   placed a bridge across, and then successfully helped to
   mop-up the village of Maresches. Later, after the enemy had
   counter-attacked, he advanced with two platoons, collecting men
   of other regiments, and eventually established our position
   north-east of the mill, which he held until relieved. In the
   operation he took 40 prisoners.


ROBINSON, 2/Lt. Norgrove Stewart                                R.G.A.

   ST. QUENTIN, 21st March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. This officer, commanding the left-half
   battery, was engaged in pulling into position when the enemy
   opened a heavy and concentrated fire, inflicting a number of
   casualties on the men, who had been up all night. Only one gun
   was in position, but he got the second gun into action, only to
   be destroyed by a direct hit, which killed or wounded the whole
   detachment. Meantime, with great exertions he got the third gun
   into action, and kept the two guns firing till midday, when the
   ammunition was expended. His conduct throughout the day was
   admirable.


ROCHFORD, 2/Lt. John Robert                           10/Royal Warwick

   Near LOUPART WOOD, 25th March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty in directing the fire of his company
   with the greatest coolness when the troops on both flanks had
   withdrawn. His splendid example inspired his men to hold on
   until the last possible moment, and in the final withdrawal
   he was again conspicuous in handling his men to provide the
   necessary covering fire.


ROE, Lieut. Alfred                              7/Lancashire Fusiliers

   Near ARMENTIERES, 1st February, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. He led his party to their final objective,
   obtained valuable identifications, and brought his party back
   without a casualty. He set his men a splendid example.


ROLLES, 2/Lt. Nathaniel                               14/Royal Warwick

   Near GOUZEAUCOURT, 27th September, 1918. He led his platoon
   in the attack with conspicuous gallantry under heavy fire to
   the further objective, during which his company lost 60 per
   cent., including all the officers. His consistent courage and
   determination in the face of heavy odds in keeping his men
   together, and rallying leaderless men of other units, was worthy
   of the highest praise.

ROSCOE, Major William                   2/South Lancashire (25/M.G.C.)

   BEAUREVOIR. For gallantry, initiative and devotion to duty
   throughout the period 8th to 18th October, 1918. On the night
   7/8 he was in charge of the machine-gun barrage in front of
   BEAUREVOIR. He moved his company into positions under heavy
   shell fire, personally reconnoitring each position and sighting
   all guns. Later, on 17th October, at LE CATEAU, he was again in
   charge of the machine-gun barrages, which he contrived to fire
   repeatedly on various targets at the request of the infantry.


ROSE, 2/Lt. Eric William                          Lancashire Fusiliers

   SAPIGNIES, 25th March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty in action. Although a very junior officer he
   commanded his company with great courage and ability, and his
   resolution in the leading of a counter-attack was worthy of the
   utmost praise.


ROSE, Lieut. Matthew Howard                              22/Manchester

   GUILLEMONT, 21st August, 1916. For conspicuous gallantry and
   determination on reconnaissance. Having discovered some of the
   enemy in a dug-out at the bottom of a steep bank, and being
   accompanied by only one man, he returned to our lines, and the
   same night organised a successful bombing party against the
   dug-out, capturing a machine gun. The success of this raid was
   entirely due to the coolness and ability displayed by Lieut.
   Rose.


ROSHER, Capt. John Brenchley                            10/Durham L.I.

   Awarded 1st January, 1917.

   Near LIEVIN, 9th May, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty in making his way on two occasions to
   advanced posts which were under heavy hostile shell fire. He
   rallied and reorganised the men, who were considerably shaken,
   remaining with them until the enemy’s fire slackened, and
   restoring their confidence. He showed great initiative and
   disregard of danger.

                              BAR TO M.C.

   RICHEBOURG ST. VAAST, 3rd September, 1918. He handled his
   company with remarkable skill and gallantry in an attack.
   Being in support when the company in front was held up, he
   displayed commendable initiative and great disregard of danger
   in reconnoitring close to the enemy’s position, whereby he was
   able to attack them in flank, killing or taking prisoners many
   of them, and capturing a machine gun.


RUNDELL, Capt. Leslie Eric                                    7/London

   LOOS, 14th February, 1916. For conspicuous gallantry. When the
   enemy exploded a mine, destroying a portion of our trench,
   his prompt initiative and disregard of personal danger under
   heavy fire enabled the near edge of the crater to be seized and
   consolidated.

                              BAR TO M.C.

   VIMY RIDGE, 21st May, 1916. For conspicuous gallantry and

 SALTER, Lieut. Carl Russell Colley                          20/London

   SHAB SALLAH, 29th December, 1917. During the attack, after his
   company commander had become a casualty, he took charge of
   the company, which he reorganised under heavy machine-gun and
   rifle fire, repulsed an attack on his flank, and personally
   led a charge against the enemy on his front. His leadership,
   coolness and initiative largely contributed to the success of
   the operations.


SAUNDERS, Capt. Cornelius James                              24/London

   Awarded 3rd June, 1917.


SAVAGE, 2/Lt. James Percival                                 13/London

   JERUSALEM, December, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. On the enemy gaining a temporary footing on
   the right flank of the line he immediately collected a few men
   and charged into the midst of the enemy, whom he succeeded in
   holding in check until that section of the line was reorganised,
   after which the enemy were completely repulsed. His gallantry
   and presence of mind undoubtedly averted the possibility of
   critical developments.


SAVOURS, 2/Lt. Herbert Jay                           3/Royal Fusiliers

   FONTAINE-AU-BOIS, LEVAL and MONT DOURLERS, 3rd to 8th November,
   1918. For conspicuous skill and gallantry in leading his company
   during the operations. In spite of a dense fog he made good each
   stage of the advance until the final objective was reached,
   where his company captured an enemy field battery near LES
   ETOQUIES. He set a very fine example to his men.


SAWNEY, 2/Lt. Leslie Thomas                           7/West Yorkshire

   BUCQUOY, 23/24 May, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and devotion
   to duty in charge of a raiding party against a suspected hostile
   post, which he had previously located by a daring reconnaissance
   under heavy fire. When the raiding party approached the post
   the enemy were found to be on the alert and in great force,
   and his party came under heavy rifle fire. He nevertheless
   rushed forward in advance of his men and engaged the enemy in
   hand-to-hand fighting. Having inflicted severe casualties on
   them, he gave the signal for the raiding party to retire, and
   was himself the last man to leave the trench. His fine courage
   and leadership throughout set a fine example to all ranks with
   him.


SCOONES, 2/Lt. Thomas Collins                     2/Gordon Highlanders

   Awarded 1st January, 1916.

   PASSCHENDAELE, 4th to 12th October, 1917. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty in directing traffic during eight
   days’ operations with very little rest. His fine example, great
   coolness and judgment had a marked influence on the troops
   crowded on the road, when excitement would have added to the
   dangers and difficulties caused by heavy congestion.


 SCOTT, Capt. Robert Francis Cloete                          1/Lincoln

   Awarded 3rd June, 1919.


SCOTT, Lieut. Theodore Gilbert                               4/Norfolk

   VIRY NOREUIL, 24th March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty when at a critical stage of a heavy
   enemy attack he collected a party of 50 men at a bridgehead
   and directed a deadly fire upon the advancing enemy masses,
   delaying their advance. He continued to walk about under heavy
   machine-gun fire, encouraging his men until ordered to retire to
   a new line of defence. He set a magnificent example of courage
   and leadership.


SCOTT-JAMES, 2/Lt. Rolfe Arnold                                 R.G.A.

   Near BEAURAIN, 28th March, 1918. Whilst the battery was in
   action, and also on the occasion when the guns had to be quickly
   withdrawn, he at all times, by his example and disregard of
   danger kept the detachments working coolly and efficiently,
   despite the most intense hostile shelling.


SCUDAMORE, 2/Lt. Charles Greenwich                            7/London

   HENINEL, 13th April, 1917. Although wounded he continued to lead
   his men, and gave directions for the holding of the captured
   positions, and returned to hand in his report before having his
   wound attended. He set a fine example throughout.


SCURLOCK, Lieut. Stephen John                   8/Lancashire Fusiliers

   Near MERRIES and CELERY COPSE, 13th August, 1918. For
   conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. After his company
   commander had been killed he ably reorganised his company,
   which had suffered heavy casualties, under heavy fire. He also
   made a personal reconnaissance and brought back very valuable
   information. He did fine work.


SCRUTTON, Major Alan Edward          1/Artists (2nd & 15th Tank Corps)

   BAYONVILLERS, 8th August, 1918. This officer showed conspicuous
   ability and gallantry. In order to make certain that his tanks
   reached their starting-points in good time, and went into action
   ahead of the infantry, he went with them to the starting-point
   and went into action on foot with the infantry. He afterwards
   rallied his tanks at the first objective, reorganised them
   there, and detailed sections for tasks in the second phase
   of the operations. In this phase his tanks encountered heavy
   resistance from heavy field guns firing over open sights, but he
   nevertheless kept in close touch with them throughout, and went
   on with them to their final objective, which they reached after
   overcoming very formidable resistance at many points on the
   way. He has at all times shown remarkable initiative, powers of
   leadership, and contempt of danger.


SCRUTTON, Lieut. John Austin                                      R.E.

   Awarded 3rd June, 1916.


SELFE, Capt. Arthur Edward Ferrour        1/Artists: Coldstream Guards

   PILKEM RIDGE, 31st July, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. During an attack he displayed remarkable
   initiative and grasp of a difficult situation in capturing his
   own objective as well as a strong point outside his area which
   would have considerably held up the attack. On obtaining his
   objective he quickly reorganised under heavy machine-gun fire,
   and throughout this day and the following one kept his company
   going under the most adverse circumstances by his splendid
   personal example.


SELIGSOHN, 2/Lt. Heinrich Leon                                3/London

   NOREUIL, 22nd March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. Having brought up a party of men from the
   transport lines he took up a line in front of a village, where
   he was attacked in great force. He held out for many hours, but
   was finally driven back. He rallied his men on the other side of
   the village, and with the greatest dash and determination led
   a charge through the village and recaptured the line, thereby
   undoubtedly saving a very serious situation.

                              BAR TO M.C.

   Near CHIPILLY, 8th August, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry in
   action. With a small party of headquarter details he attacked

   inspiring effect on all ranks.

   Awarded 3rd June, 1918.

   RIENCOURT, 30th August, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion during an attack, when his company was exposed to
   a very hostile barrage. His coolness and leadership took the
   company successfully through. Later, being exposed to heavy
   machine-gun fire, he halted his company, taking up a position
   in shell holes. He then led forward a platoon, outflanking
   the hostile machine guns, compelling them to withdraw, and
   successfully led the company to its objective. His courage and
   resource were worthy of the highest praise.


SHEPHERD, Lieut. Walter Scott                                  2/Wilts

   Awarded 1st January, 1917.

   BULLECOURT, 31st August, 1918. When his company commander was
   wounded shortly after the attack commenced he took command, and
   led his men with gallantry and resolution to their objective,
   where he held his position under difficult conditions and
   against determined efforts of the enemy to outflank and
   penetrate our line. His example of courage and able leadership
   largely contributed to the success achieved.


SHORT, Capt. John Rodwell                                 13/Yorkshire

   Near VILLERS GUISLAIN, 14th March, 1917. Prior to the raid on
   the enemy trenches he made several personal reconnaissances of
   the enemy’s wire and positions, and it was largely owing to his
   gallantry and fine leadership that the attack was pressed home.
   The hostile trenches were entered, several of the enemy killed
   and two prisoners captured, at a time when identifications were
   of incalculable value. He had previously shown the greatest
   skill and judgment in organising, equipping and training his men
   for the raid, for the undoubted success of which he was largely
   responsible.


SHORT, 2/Lt. Harold                           1/Loyal North Lancashire

   N. of BAPAUME-CAMBRAI ROAD, 22nd March, 1918. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty in leading his platoon through a
   heavy barrage to reinforce a corps line. On the succeeding days,
   and until he was wounded, he was a model of coolness and courage
   to his men, and his cheerfulness throughout the operations was
   of invaluable assistance to all ranks with him.


SIBREE, Capt. Herbert John Hyde                              1/Norfolk

   LONGUEVAL, 27th July, 1916, and FALFEMONT FARM, 4th September,
   1916. When his company was held up by machine-gun fire, and he
   himself was wounded, he continued to move about under heavy fire
   reorganising his company until he was again wounded. On another

   Near YPRES, 20th September, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty in an attack. Though wounded at the beginning

   BOURLON WOOD, 27th November to 3rd December, 1917. For
   conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty when in command of a
   platoon. His company commander having become a casualty during
   an attack, he took command, displaying great courage and skill
   in consolidating the posts at the objective, and suffering few
   casualties although the area was swept by heavy fire. He set a
   fine example of keenness and cheerfulness and was ever ready to
   grasp the situation, and act on it with rapidity and discretion.

                              BAR TO M.C.

   E. of AUCHONVILLERS-AVELUY WOOD, 26th to 29th March, 1918. For
   conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He was in command
   of a platoon, and by his own personal gallantry and powers of
   leadership was instrumental in keeping his part of the line
   intact and breaking up enemy attacks. On another occasion, owing
   to casualties, he was placed in command of a company, with which
   he held the right of the line and carried out a most successful
   and difficult relief. He showed splendid powers of command, and
   set a very high example during a most trying period.


SKEVINGTON, Capt. Alan Percival                  2/West Yorks (M.G.C.)

   BOURLON WOOD and MOEUVRES, 29th November to 5th December, 1917.
   For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He performed
   most efficient and gallant service in the handling of his
   machine guns, and assisted materially in repelling an enemy
   attack. His guns were subjected to intense shell fire, and four
   of them were put out of action, but he held his position for
   eight days, setting his men a splendid example of determination
   and resource.


SKIPPON, 2/Lt. David Leslie                              14/Tank Corps

   Near VILLERS-LES-CAGNICOURT, September 2nd, 1918. His tank
   proceeded well ahead of the infantry, and in face of direct and
   accurate enemy field-gun fire he showed great determination in
   overcoming enemy resistance. He continued fighting his tank
   until it received several direct hits, himself and all his crew
   being badly wounded. The action of this officer’s tank was
   particularly gallant and useful.


SLANEY, 2/Lt. Arnold John Robinson                           17/London

   JERUSALEM, 8th November, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. Leading his platoon on the directing flank of
   the assault, his courage and fine leadership enabled his men to
   carry the objective and advance beyond it on the heels of the
   retreating enemy, who suffered heavy casualties. Taking up a
   line with marked rapidity, he organised his defence with great
   skill, and from it inflicted further heavy casualties on the
   enemy, whose whole line gave way.


SLATER, Lieut. George Edward Herbert                          1/Border

   Near HOOGEMOLEN, 22nd October, 1918. For great gallantry and
   devotion to duty. He held his company together in the assembly
   position when subjected to heavy shell fire. Later, he led them
   to the assault and penetrated the enemy’s lines to a depth of
   1,500 yards. With his strength reduced to 19 rifles, he held
   on for some time and then withdrew to a fresh position and
   consolidated.


 SMART, 2/Lt. James Lamont                       8/West Yorks (M.G.C.)

   Near GAVRELLE, 23rd April, 1917 For conspicuous gallantry and
   skill in an attack, when he succeeded in getting all his guns
   into position under heavy fire, and inflicting very severe

   initiative.

   Near ARMENTIERES, 7/8 February, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty during a raid on the enemy’s trenches.
   He commanded a party which searched the enemy’s trenches and
   captured eight of the enemy and one machine gun. By his personal
   example of determination and courage he was responsible for
   the success achieved by his party. Before the raid he had
   reconnoitred “No Man’s Land” under enemy machine-gun fire, and
   obtained valuable information.


SMIRKE, Capt. Edward Alexander                  7/Lancashire Fusiliers

   TEMPLEUX QUARRIES, 21st March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty during a retirement, when he took command
   of the battalion, which he retained until wounded. By his cool
   leadership and personal disregard of all danger he held his men
   together in the most difficult circumstances, organising and
   leading counter-attacks continuously.


SMITH, Lieut. Arthur Wedgwood Gifford                      7(2)Bedford

   PREUX AU BOIS, 4th November, 1918. During the attack, while
   acting as battalion intelligence officer he showed great skill
   in marking out the route for the approach march and getting the
   battalion into position on a very dark night. Subsequently, when
   the situation was obscure, he went forward under heavy fire, and
   got in touch with all the companies, and established a report
   centre practically in the front line, sending back information
   which was invaluable in dealing with enemy strong points.


SMITH, 2/Lt. Ernest Rees                       Motor Machine Gun Corps

   Near LA VACQUERIE, 1st December, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. During the defence of our position, by
   his splendid example of courage and coolness, he undoubtedly
   saved some of the guns of a neighbouring brigade and effectively
   checked the enemy’s advance in that sector. After the guns had
   been got away he remained in defence of the positions. He sent
   in valuable information to the generals of two brigades, carried
   out machine-gun defence work, and greatly assisted in organising
   the infantry defence.


SMITH, 2/Lt. Frank Edward Corbitt Douglas                3/Durham L.I.

   Near YPRES, 20th to 22nd September, 1917. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty. During a counter-attack by the
   enemy he led his platoon forward out of the trenches, the better
   to meet the attack, and brought his left flank up so that the
   enemy were enfiladed and driven back in disorder. He set a fine
   example to his men throughout the operations.


SMITH, 2/Lt. George Ernest                                      R.G.A.

 SMITH, Capt. Geoffery Hubert                      1/Coldstream Guards

   Near MOYENVILLE, 21st to 23rd August. 1918. For conspicuous
   gallantry and fine leadership in an attack through an
   impenetrable fog. On reaching the objective his company
   commander was killed. He at once took charge and reorganised the
   company, which was being heavily bombarded. Later he captured
   the final objective, and although his right flank was in the air
   he so disposed his command as to give very good security.


SMITH, 2/Lt. Gordon Richard                              3/West Riding

   Near ROBECQ, 18th July, 1918. For most gallant service in
   connection with a raid. Though severely wounded shortly after
   his Stokes mortars opened he urged his teams to continue firing.
   Four men were killed and one wounded besides himself, but
   owing to his indomitable spirit the survivors stuck it out and
   completed the firing. The barrage was most accurate, many enemy
   dead being found by the raiding party.


SMITH, Lieut. Morrison Churchill                              R.M.L.I.

   Awarded 3rd June, 1919.

   JONCOURT, 1st October, 1918. For great gallantry and good work.
   When two of his guns and teams were partly buried by enemy
   barrage prior to a counter-attack he extricated such of the men
   as had not become casualties. He then under very heavy fire
   pushed forward four guns to the advanced posts, and defended the
   exposed left flank of the brigade, engaging enemy parties at
   close range and effectively breaking them up.


SMITH, 2/Lt. Percy Landon                             11/Royal Warwick

   RIEZ DU VINAGE, 30th June, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty in commanding a wave of a raiding party which
   successfully penetrated the enemy’s lines in daylight. Heavy
   casualties were inflicted on the enemy, about 50 being killed
   and five taken prisoners. He was almost entirely responsible for
   the preliminary reconnaissance. He did splendid service.


SMITH, 2/Lt. Sydney Bernard                     Loyal North Lancashire

   RICHEBOURG L’AVOUE, January, 1917. He carried out a dangerous
   reconnaissance of the enemy’s wire. Accompanied by another

   S. of YPRES-COMINES CANAL, 7th June, 1917. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty in command of a bombing party
   which was to co-operate with the tanks in the capture of a
   position. The tanks having failed to arrive at the right moment,
   he successfully took the position with a bombing party, and
   established communication with the battalion on his left,
   displaying great coolness and resource at a critical moment.

                              BAR TO M.C.

   CONTALMAISON, 25th March, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. When the enemy were pressing their attacks
   down a communication trench this officer, moving along the
   top of the parapet and using his revolver, himself led two
   counter-attacks which drove the enemy back. His courage and the
   determination with which he led his men undoubtedly produced
   this successful result.

                          SECOND BAR TO M.C.

   Near MOISLAINS, 5/6 September, 1918. During the operations
   he displayed great gallantry and initiative in leading his
   company to the attack, and also in assisting the other company
   commanders, who were junior subalterns, in the reorganisation
   and consolidation. His contempt of danger set a fine example to
   those under him, and his clear reports of the situation were of
   the greatest assistance to his commanding officer.


SOLOMON, Staff-Capt. Jerrold Bernard    2/Oxford & Bucks L.I. (R.F.C.)

   In FRANCE, 20th and 24th November, 1917. He carried out a patrol
   lasting nearly three hours in a very high wind and low clouds,
   flying at an average height of 500 ft., and brought back a
   valuable report. During the flight he attacked and drove down an
   enemy two-seater machine under heavy rifle and machine-gun fire
   from the ground. He also made a valuable reconnaissance in very
   bad weather, flying at an average height of 100 ft. under heavy
   rifle and machine-gun fire, in the course of which he engaged a
   hostile battery with his machine gun. He set a splendid example
   of courage and determination.


SOUTTEN, Major Arthur Camille                                11/London

   Near YPRES, 23rd September, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and

   devotion in action when he went forward with four scouts to
   locate the position of the enemy. During the reconnaissance his
   four scouts were wounded, and it was only by crawling under
   heavy fire that he was able to take back information of the
   highest importance. His courage and determination were very
   marked.


SOWARD, 2/Lt. Frank                                         5/D.C.L.I.

   HAVRINCOURT, 15th to 18th September, 1918. When the company
   commander became a casualty this officer took charge, and led on
   with great skill and gallantry, securing the objective, which
   was strongly held by the enemy. For a time his advance was held
   up by machine guns, but after a personal reconnaissance he
   worked up a trench with bombing squads and Lewis gunners, and
   drove the enemy out with great loss.


 SPENCER, 2/Lt. Joseph Thomas                               8(2)London

   E. of POZIERES, 19th September, 1918. For most conspicuous
   gallantry during the operations. This officer gallantly rallied

   inspired his men. He was subsequently wounded.

   Near ARRAS, 14th October, 1917. When he was in command of a
   section of a raiding party his section encountered severe

   taking eight prisoners. He had previously carried out two
   reconnaissances.


SQUIRE, 2/Lt. Edwin Ross                                     5/Lincoln

   Near LENS, 1st July, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty when commanding a flank company of an assault.
   Finding the enemy in a strong position and offering considerable
   resistance he at once organised his company for defence, and
   repulsed two counter-attacks. Throughout the day he held on
   to the positions he had taken, organising them in a very able
   manner under heavy fire of all kinds, and doing work which
   was extremely valuable, as well as being of an exceptionally
   difficult nature.


STAHL, Capt. Arthur                                             R.F.A.

   Near BAILLEUL, 13th April, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. During an attack by the enemy this officer
   noticed a dangerous gap in our line on the flank of the brigade.
   He immediately counter-attacked with much gallantry under heavy
   fire, and although shot through the arm he succeeded in retaking
   and holding our original posts.


STANCLIFF, 2/Lt. Robert                                       2/London

   In FRANCE, March, 1918. On one occasion, when on offensive
   patrol, he, by the skilful handling of his machine and accurate
   shooting, destroyed two enemy aeroplanes and brought down a
   third out of control. In addition, during the nine days previous
   to this, he had destroyed five other enemy machines, two of
   these being triplanes. The services which he has rendered have
   been exceptionally brilliant, and his skill and determination
   are deserving of the highest praise.


STEEL, 2/Lt. Edward Gerald                                   20/London

   Near LENS, 8/9 June, 1917. He led his sub-section forward under
   heavy fire with great initiative and determination, and by his
   supporting fire at point blank range enabled the storming party
   to get forward. Later in the attack he covered the retirement
   with great skill, successfully accounting for 50 of the enemy,
   who were approaching over the open. He did not withdraw his guns
   until the last possible moment.

                              BAR TO M.C.

   Near DICKEBUSCH, 7/9 May, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. This officer was in charge of a section
   of guns for three days’ fighting. After enduring a heavy
   bombardment, when both he and his men were suffering from the
   effects of gas, he accomplished a counter-attack in the evening.
   When the bulk of the infantry was checked he pressed on by using
   concealed approaches with a thin wave of infantry, and came into
   action just behind, filling a gap which might at any moment have
   been penetrated by the enemy. He showed the greatest coolness
   and judgment in getting his guns into position and checking the
   enemy.


    STEPHENS, 2/Lt. George                                 /Gloucester

STEVENS, Capt. William Cecil                               1/Worcester

   Near YPRES, 31st July, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. During important operations he showed very
   quick grasp of the situation, and was of the greatest assistance
   to his commanding officer. On one occasion, when no orderlies
   were available, he himself carried an important message under
   very heavy shell fire with the utmost fearlessness and disregard
   of personal danger.

                              BAR TO M.C.

   Near ST. CHRIST, N. of SOMME, from 22nd March to 2nd April,
   1918. For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty during
   11 days of very severe fighting. Throughout the whole of this
   period, acting as adjutant, his untiring efforts were constantly
   directed to the handling of the battalion, and his fine example
   set a standard for all ranks, which enabled them to carry out
   the duties assigned to them. After his commanding officer had
   been wounded he assumed increased responsibilities with the
   greatest courage and resource, and the ability of the battalion
   to respond to the calls made on it at critical moments was
   largely due to his fine work.

                          SECOND BAR TO M.C.

   TRESLON and SOULEUSE RIDGES, 27th May, 1918. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty during an enemy attack. He did
   invaluable work in keeping men of his battalion together during
   severe fighting under heavy fire, when any lack of resolution
   would have been fatal to prospects of success. Two days later
   he was conspicuous by the way in which he helped to control the
   fight and reorganise defences during a long and hard-fought
   fight.


STEWART, Lieut. Oliver 9/Middlesex                            (R.F.C.)

   Between BRUGES and OSTEND, 13th July, 1917. For conspicuous
   gallantry and devotion to duty. He has done consistent good work

   company with conspicuous gallantry and great dash to the capture
   of their objective. He then took a party with a Lewis gun in
   pursuit of the retreating enemy, on whom he inflicted severe
   losses. Having destroyed a bridge over the river he consolidated
   a selected position well in advance of the objective, and though
   badly wounded he continued to direct operations for some time.
   During all this time he was under heavy enemy machine-gun and
   sniping fire at short range.


STOREY, 2/Lt. Kenneth                                    2/Durham L.I.

   HOOGE, 9th August, 1915. For conspicuous gallantry and skill
   when in command of bombing parties. He was seriously wounded
   while directing his men. The success of our attack and the
   subsequent holding of the position were largely due to the
   coolness and dash of the bomb throwers under 2/Lt. Storey.


STORM, 2/Lt. William George                         5/York & Lancaster

   THIEPVAL, 16/17 September, 1916. He led a party of
   volunteers in an attempt to surprise an enemy post. Though

   HAIRPIN, 25/26 January, 1916. For conspicuous gallantry
   and resource. When he heard of an enemy working-party in the
   vicinity he took a corporal and light machine gun down a sap,
   mounted the corporal on his back to enable the latter to fire
   over the parapet, and opened fire. Later, mounted on the
   corporal’s back, Lieut. Stout opened fire, although by this
   time they had been discovered. Next morning 14 dead enemy were
   counted, and more must have been wounded.


STRATTON, 2/Lt. Gilbert Leonard                                 R.F.A.

   RAMADI, 11th July, 1917. When his section was subjected
   to intense and accurate fire from six hostile guns he worked

   extraordinary energy throughout the day, and set a fine example
   of courage and determination to his section.


STRODE, Capt. Maurice                                    2/West Surrey

   GHELUVELT, 26th October, 1917. When several battalions were held
   up by machine-gun fire, and many men of different units were
   without leaders owing to casualties, although he was on duty
   at battalion headquarters, he voluntarily went forward, and
   in spite of heavy fire got 100 men into a suitable defensive
   position.

                              BAR TO M.C.

   Awarded 1st January, 1918.

   Near POELCAPPELLE, 9th October, 1917. When in command of his
   platoon during an attack he captured a concrete emplacement held
   by two enemy machine guns, and later assisted in capturing a
   strong point by working round its flank. He took out a patrol of
   six men to gain touch with the company on his right, and though

   battle, the operations in the YPRES SALIENT from 31st July to
   20th October, and the CAMBRAI battle, he has shown the utmost

   Near ALBERT, 26/27 March, 1918. During the enemy attack he
   rushed forward, and by his coolness and courage inspired such
   confidence in his men whose officers were casualties that a new
   line was established. On the following day, when the enemy were
   about to attack a detached post, he collected reinforcements
   and led them to the post, which he found to be surrounded by

   devotion to duty. Having gone forward to clear up the situation
   he found it was critical owing to the enemy envelopment of our
   left flank. He promptly organised a defensive flank, which held
   out long enough to save a large portion of the brigade from
   being cut off. It was due to his ability and promptness that a
   disaster was averted, and his good staff work contributed very
   largely to the success of the whole operation.


THOMPSON, Capt. George Kenneth             5/East Lancashire (9/Yorks)

   RUE DU BOIS, on night of 31st December, 1915, and 1st January,

   and devotion to duty during an attack. As battalion signalling
   officer he kept up communication with companies, on one occasion

   reorganised and the line firmly established.

   Near YPRES, 20th September, 1917. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty in constantly going backwards and

   and courage on many occasions.

   gallantry and devotion to duty when in command of his battalion
   raiding party. The night before the raid he accompanied patrols

   valuable information. On the night of the raid itself he led
   the centre of the attack, and showed the greatest gallantry and
   coolness in visiting the other sub-sections and ascertaining
   that all objectives had been gained. His fine example largely

   action and maintain their fire for a much greater length of time
   than would otherwise have been possible. Though he suffered
   casualties amongst his men and animals, he delivered ammunition
   to all the guns and then returned and brought up a second load.

   and later the same day he managed to restore the line at a
   point within 30 yards of the enemy. By his unbounded energy

   difficult conditions and on ground which was entirely unfamiliar

   It was entirely due to him that the battalion effected the
   relief and formed up in time to assume the offensive.

   very trying circumstances. Three days later, without guides and
   under heavy shell fire, he managed to find each battery and

   devotion to duty during operations when attached with half a
   section to an infantry battalion. The initiative he displayed
   was of the highest order, and his courage in handling his

   with utter disregard to his own personal safety, was most
   praiseworthy.

   MEDVYEJA-GORA, he secured the left flank of the attack, and
   handled his platoon with the skill he invariably displayed.

   officers, and then with great coolness and determined energy he
   caused the gun to be dismounted and moved before it sustained
   serious damage from the heavy shelling.


WRIXON, Lieut. Maurice Percival Bentley               Grenadier Guards

   ARLEUX, 19th February, 1918. During a hostile raid he was in
   charge of all the front posts, and on hearing rifle fire walked
   through a most intense barrage to the left flank post, where the
   raid was taking place. Immediately grasping the situation, and
   on seeing that two strong enemy parties had penetrated between
   our posts, he organised bombing parties, and opened fire with a
   machine gun on one of the enemy parties, which retired, leaving
   one of their wounded. Seeing the other party coming up behind
   him he ran down the trench to meet them, killed the leading man,
   and, supported by a few men, drove back this party, killing and
   wounding several. His great personal courage, coolness, and the
   fine military qualities which he displayed were a magnificent
   example to all ranks.


YATES, Major Henry George                                       R.F.A.

   Awarded 1st January, 1918.


YATES, Capt. William                                        3/Cheshire

   GUYENCOURT, 27/28 May, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty during a retirement. He showed great skill and
   determination in maintaining his position with very few men in
   the face of heavy enemy attacks. In particular one night he
   reorganised his men and parties of stragglers and dug in a line,
   and in spite of heavy shelling and machine-gun fire, repelled
   all enemy attacks for 12 hours until ordered to retire. He
   showed excellent leadership throughout.


YOUNG, Lieut. Oliver                        4/Northumberland Fusiliers

   Near CONCAVREU, 27th May, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   and devotion to duty. He took charge of a small party and
   successfully held up the enemy for a considerable period
 while
   the engineers destroyed a bridge. He organised a skilful defence
   in spite of heavy rifle and machine-gun fire. His consistent
   gallantry while fighting a rearguard action set a fine example
   to all men serving under him, and caused heavy losses to the
   enemy.

YUILL, Lieut. Harry Hogg                       170th Mining Coy., R.E.

   For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty on several
   occasions:--

   CUINCHY, 29th May, 1915. When one of the leads to a charge in a
   mine broke close to the charge, he at once untamped the top of
   the charge and crawled into the mine to find and mend the break,
   although the Germans were working so close he could hear them
   talking.

   CAMBRIN, 24th and 29th June. At great personal risk, he charged
   mines, well knowing the Germans to be charging against him, and
   managed to fire his charges before they succeeded in doing so.

   CUINCHY, on the night of 21/22 August. Again 2/Lt. Yuill
   exhibited great skill and bravery in directing mining
   operations. The enemy were working within a few feet of our
   galleries, opposite No. 5 and 7 mines, and it became a race
   which mines would be first exploded. The situation was critical,
   but owing to his splendid example and energy two shafts were
   sunk in time, charged and tamped. The resulting explosions must
   have blown in the German galleries and the miners in them.

FISHER, 2/Lt. Charles Heath                             12/East Surrey

   Near WYTSCHAETE, 3/4 September, 1918. For conspicuous gallantry
   on reconnaissance. In spite of the fact that his runner was
   wounded, he returned himself and gave a valuable report as
   to the position of one of our posts in front of the line. He
   afterwards conducted three men with rations and water back to
   this post, in spite of the country through which they had to
   pass being under continuous machine-gun and snipers’ fire.


NELSON, Lieut. William Percival                   R.A.M.C. (1/Artists)

   RUMILLY, 8th October, 1918. For gallantry and devotion to duty.
   During a very severe bombardment of artillery and machine guns
   he constantly went out to the help of the wounded, attending
   them with utter disregard for danger, and was the means of
   saving several lives and alleviating a great deal of suffering.
   He has at all times set a striking example by his fearlessness
   and devotion to duty.


SMITH, Capt. Walter Campbell
                            1/Artists (4th Bn., Special Brigade, R.E.)

                 (_Particulars omitted from page 126_)

   This officer was in command of a double company (“P” and “Q”)
   operating on the 55th Divisional front. Throughout the enormous
   work involved in the preparations, he handled the difficult
   situations that arose with insight and resource, and by his
   careful attention to detail and indefatigable energy enabled the
   complicated operations to be carried through without a hitch.

   The services referred to were rendered on the
   BLAIREVILLE-FICHEUX front between 13th and 28th June, 1916,
   culminating in the gas attack launched from that front on the
   latter date.


                               =D.F.C.=

_The Distinguished Flying Cross is awarded to Officers and Warrant

CANNING, Lieut. Ernest Harold                    1/Gloucester (R.A.F.)

   FRANCE, 28th August, 1918: also many other dates. This officer
   has displayed marked courage and skill in bombing enemy
   transport, etc., at low altitudes. He took a conspicuous part in
   the attack on bridges over a river between ARRAS and CAMBRAI:
   subjected to very heavy machine-gun fire he descended to 150
   feet to exactly locate their position, and bombed them from a
   low altitude.

    [4824

COULSON, Lieut. Charles Stanley Lomas            80th Squadron, R.A.F.

   N. of MORLANCOURT, 9th August, 1918, and many other places
   and dates. During the late operations this officer has set a
   brilliant example of courage and skill, notably on one occasion
   when, observing a party of the enemy in a trench firing at some
   of our infantry, he repeatedly dived on the trench, firing at
   the occupants and distracting their attention from our troops.
   Eventually he was wounded twice in the leg, but succeeded in
   reaching his aerodrome.

    [762695

DEW, 2/Lt. Edward Alphonse                      205th Squadron, R.A.F.

   Near BAILLEUL, 19th May, 1918, and many other places and dates.
   A keen and dashing officer, who has taken part in numerous
   bombing raids and photographic reconnaissances. Whilst on a
   bombing raid his machine, flying in rear of the formation, was
   attacked by five enemy scouts. Two of these he engaged at close
   range; at the outset he was dangerously wounded in the thigh.
   Despite this he continued firing his guns until he fainted from
   loss of blood. He succeeded in bringing down one of the scouts
   in flames.

    [766687

FAIRBAIRN, Flying-Officer Arthur Reginald
                                           4th Balloon Section, R.A.F.

   W. of FRIODMONT, 23rd October, 1918, and many other occasions.
   During recent operations this officer’s balloon was singled out
   for attack three times in two days. On the third day he was
   again attacked by six scouts when at a height of 1,500 feet. He
   behaved with the utmost coolness and gallantry in helping his
   fellow observer, who was inexperienced, out of the basket before
   parachuting himself. His determination in pushing his balloon
   forward during the recent advance has been most praiseworthy.

    [6284

FRANK, Lieut. Charles Frederick           19th Balloon Section, R.A.F.

   Near GUOY, FRANCE, 8th October, 1918: also numerous other dates
   and places. Lieut. Frank has co-operated with our artillery in
   184 successful shoots, proving himself an exceptionally capable
   and efficient officer, with keen powers of observation. On 8th
   October, under most difficult conditions, he succeeded in giving
   observations for three shoots. During this flight, owing to
   his proximity to actual operations, he was enabled to transmit
   valuable information as to hostile infantry movements.

    [5492

GOUDIE, Capt. Norman                              5th Squadron, R.A.F.

   AMIENS-ROYE, 8th August, 1918, with 2/Lt. Robert McKinley
   Jamison, R. Irish Rifles. Thrice on one date these officers
   carried out at extremely low altitudes, and in face of intense
   rifle and machine-gun fire, reconnaissances of an important
   road. During one of these reconnaissances, observing a party of
   the enemy holding our infantry, they dived on them and forced
   them to retire, and on another occasion they bombed a large
   party of the enemy, causing them to surrender to our infantry.

    [7287

GROOM, Lieut. Victor Emanuel                     20th Squadron, R.A.F.

   N.W. of WERVICQ, 8th May, 1918: also numerous other dates
   and places. An officer of great courage and dash, who never
   hesitates to attack the enemy regardless of the superiority
   in numbers. While on a recent patrol this officer was one of
   a formation of eight that engaged twenty-five hostile scouts.
   Lieut. Groom shot down one, and his observer (Lieut. Hardcastle)
   a few minutes later destroyed another. On a later date,
   accompanied by the same observer, they were attacked by twelve
   scouts; two of these they shot down.

    [762330

HAWORTH, Lieut. Peter
                    Lancashire Fusiliers; 15th Balloon Section, R.A.F.

   Awarded 1st January, 1919, for general service as a Balloon
   Commander in the Ypres salient.

    [7800

HEPBURN, Capt. Allan                             88th Squadron, R.A.F.

   TOURNAI, 12th October, 1918, and several other dates and places.
   This officer made a very fine flight, calling for courage and
   determination of a high order. Thick clouds were within 200 feet
   of the ground and the visibility was so bad that practically
   no flying was attempted. Despite these adverse conditions this
   officer volunteered to cross the lines. Climbing through the
   clouds, which were several thousand feet in depth, he flew above
   them, guided by compass, with no view of the ground. Continuing
   his flight until he estimated that he was in the vicinity of
   a certain objective, he descended, and found himself 150 feet
   over an enemy railway station. Dropping his bombs, he destroyed
   a passenger train, and afterwards engaged enemy troops and
   transport with machine-gun fire. Having caused considerable
   damage, Capt. Hepburn climbed through the clouds and found his
   way home.

    [8179

HICKS, Lieut. George Rensbury                  74th  Squadron,  R.A.F.

   Awarded 3rd June, 1919, for good service and very gallant

   Awarded 3rd June, 1919, for good service on reconnaissance,
   photographic service, and also in counter-battery work.

    [4528

JONES, Lieut. William Ernest Frank            101st  Squadron,  R.A.F.

   Between ALBERT and PROYART, 14th June, 1918. This officer
   carried out a comprehensive reconnaissance by night in heavy
   rain at a height of only 400 feet. He returned to his aerodrome
   in the face of a blinding storm, after a flight of three hours.
   He has carried out sixty-four night bombing raids. His courage
   and perseverance are exceptional.

    [7645558

LAGESSE, Capt. Camille Henri Raoul             29th  Squadron,  R.A.F.

   Near NEUF-BERQUIN, 28th May, 1918. When on wireless interception
   duty Capt. Lagesse, in company with another officer, was
   attacked by seven scouts. Engaging one, he followed it down from
   11,000 feet to 2,000 feet, when it crashed. Bold in attack,
   skilful in execution, he has proved himself on many occasions to
   be a fine airman.

                             BAR TO D.F.C.

   E. of BAILLEUL, August, 1918, and numerous other dates and
   places. A scout leader of marked ability and daring who, since
   28th August, has destroyed thirteen enemy aeroplanes, displaying
   at all times brilliant leadership and courage. On 2nd October,
   when leading a patrol of four machines, he dived on eight
   Fokkers; four of these were destroyed, Capt. Lagesse accounting
   for one.

    [766025

MACDONALD, Lieut. Eric Norman            Independent Air Force, R.A.F.

   Awarded 3rd June, 1919, for 13 successful night bombing raids.

NICHOLAS, 2/Lt. Gerald Basil                    102nd Squadron, R.A.F.

   LANDRECIES, 14/15 October, 1918, and many other dates and
   places. This officer has carried out 95 night bombing raids, and
   has displayed marked skill and initiative. He has been extremely
   successful in low reconnaissances and attacks on ground targets,
   having twice obtained direct hits on trains at a height of about
   800 feet.

    [766565

POGSON, 2/Lt. Desmond Philip
                         104th Squadron, Independent Air Force, R.A.F.

   MANNHEIM, 22nd August, 1918, and many other occasions. In a
   recent long-distance bombing raid his petrol tank received a
   shot immediately after crossing the line, but he continued on
   his journey and bombed the distant objective. On the return
   journey very fierce fighting occurred, during which both leaders
   and deputy-leaders of our formations were shot down, and the
   remaining machines lost touch with each other. At this critical
   moment 2/Lt. Pogson ordered his observer to tie his handkerchief
   to the gun-mounting to indicate that his was the leader’s
   machine. He then circled over the area three times and picked up
   five of our machines, and in face of very hostile opposition got
   them into formation and brought them all safely home. The prompt
   action of this officer was highly meritorious, and undoubtedly
   saved the remaining machines, which could not have coped with
   the greatly superior formations of the enemy.

    [766417

RANDALL, Flying-Officer George Ebbon             20th Squadron, R.A.F.

   W. of LOVERALL, FRANCE, 10th November, 1918, and many other
   dates and places. A brave and resourceful flight commander who
   has, within the last four months previous to November 11th, led
   71 offensive patrols. On 10th November, engaging a superior
   number of enemy aircraft, he himself shot down two and the
   remainder were driven off by his flight. In addition to the
   foregoing he has four other enemy machines to his credit.

ROSS, Capt. Charles                              25th Squadron, R.A.F.

   On the DOUAI-CAMBRAI Road, 13th August, 1918. Since October last
   this officer has carried out 240 hours’ service flying, mainly
   on long solo photographic reconnaissances at very low altitudes.
   In this arduous and trying service he has shown exceptional
   skill, perseverance and courage, notably on one very important
   reconnaissance, when he was attacked by ten enemy aeroplanes.
   Engaging one at close range, this officer shot it down in
   flames, and in face of the hostile attack he completed the
   reconnaissance.

    [765422

SARGANT, Capt. Frederick Herbert St. Clair       38th Squadron, R.A.F.

   Awarded 1st January, 1919. GHISTELLES, 3/4 October, 1918, and 26

   S. of ARMENTIERES, 3rd May, 1918, and many other dates and
   places. This officer has already been awarded the Military Cross
   for gallantry and devotion to duty. Since this award he has
   accounted for eleven enemy aeroplanes--nine destroyed and two
   shot down out of control. He has proved himself a most efficient
   flight commander and an enterprising leader, setting a very fine
   example to his squadron.

    [765057

                             BAR TO D.F.C.

   E. of DURY, 15th September, 1918, and many other dates and
   places. This officer has already been awarded the Military Cross
   and the Distinguished Flying Cross for conspicuous gallantry and
   devotion to duty. Since his last award he has destroyed five
   enemy machines and driven down one out of control. His example
   of courage and resource is a fine incentive to the other pilots
   of his squadron.

WALKER, Capt. Henry Edward, _M.C._              111th Squadron, R.A.F.

   EGYPT, 16th September, 1918. A gallant and courageous officer
   who has served continuously on the front for twelve months,
   during which period he has shot down several enemy machines.
   Throughout recent operations his bombing has been exceptionally
   accurate, a large percentage of direct hits on transport, etc.,
   being obtained.

                                   1/Manchester; 59th Squadron, R.A.F.

   Over BOURSIES, 22nd March, 1918: Near BEAUMETZ, 23rd March,
   1918, and many other occasions elsewhere. This officer has
   completed over fifty successful G.B. shoots, frequently under
   adverse weather conditions, and in face of severe opposition
   from aeroplanes and anti-aircraft fire. The success of these
   operations was in many cases mainly due to his courage and
   perseverence. On one occasion, flying at 2,000 feet, he held up
   for a time the advance of hostile infantry.

                          ROLL OF COMMISSIONS

                   GAZETTED SINCE 4TH AUGUST, 1914.


                        THE REGIMENTAL PLEDGE.

                       In Parliament: A.D. 1909.

                            “THE ARTISTS.”

   Mr. W. F. D. SMITH (U.) asked the Secretary for War if the
   Artists Corps was to be reduced to 400 men; whether the corps at
   present had 700 men in the ranks; and when was the decision to
   effect the reduction arrived at?

   Mr. HALDANE: After careful consideration it has been decided
   that if this unit can undertake that a percentage of its members
   will be prepared to join the Territorial Force as officers, if
   required, on mobilisation, the War Office will be justified
   in giving the corps in exchange for this undertaking a full
   establishment of eight companies. The strength of this unit on
   June 1 amounted to 25 officers and 637 non-commissioned officers
   and men.

   Major ANSTRUTHER-GRAY: May I ask what percentage was asked for?

   Mr. HALDANE: We have not stated that so far: we will settle it
   afterwards. I have reason to think that this arrangement will be
   agreeable to the Corps.

                            ITS FULFILMENT.

                              SECTION VI.

                      THE ARTISTS’ RIFLES V.A.D.


On the 31st January, 1911, at the suggestion of Colonel Walter Horsley,
the then Commanding Officer, a small Provisional Committee was formed
with a view to raising a Voluntary Aid Detachment in connection with
the Battalion. The result was the formation of the 104th (Artists’
Rifles) V.A.D., the original members of which were all relatives or
friends of officers and men in the Regiment, and on the outbreak of
the war there was immediately available a well-trained Detachment,
numbering over 40, the whole of whom at once volunteered for service
abroad or at home.

The primary idea of such an organisation was to look after the sick
and wounded necessarily left behind a Territorial Army in action, for
whom no provision had yet been made, and to pass them back to the Base
Hospitals.

Owing to the Territorial Units being merged into the other fighting
forces the V.A.D.s were not required for the purpose for which they
were originally intended. Thereupon the 104th offered to equip and
staff an Auxiliary Military Hospital. Their offer was accepted and
the Hospital was opened on April 28th, 1915, at Egremont, Lyndhurst
Gardens, Hampstead, as an auxiliary to the Hampstead Military Hospital,
to receive 23 patients, soon increased to 25, and after a year to 32.
The entire work of the Hospital--Superintending, Nursing, Cooking, and
Cleaning was done by the members of the Detachment.

Before the Hospital was closed, on the 31st May 1919, nearly 1,000
patients had passed through the wards, two at least of whom were old
members of the Regiment.

throughout referred to as 3/28th, and Col. Horsley’s as 2/28th,
notwithstanding the re-numbering.

[4] No. 429 of 1915.

[5] EXAMPLE.--No. 760777 joined in 1915, between Oct. 29 and
Nov. 12.

[6] EXPLANATION.--In January, 1917, the 4,516 Cadets then
serving (bearing numbers between 1 and 10515) were consecutively
re-numbered 760001 to 764516. Subsequent recruits were numbered from
764517 onwards. Men transferred, or attached, to the Artists were
distinguished by special numbering and are not included in the above
Table.--ED.

[8]

In his book, “From Bapaume to Passchendaele,” Sir Phillip Gibbs thus
depicts the situation. Ed.

   “It is idle for me to try to describe this ground over which
   the London men and the Artists had to attack. Nothing that I
   can write will convey remotely the look of such ground and the
   horror of it. Unless one has seen vast fields of barren earth,
   blasted for miles by shell-fire, pitted by deep craters so
   close that they are like holes in a sieve, and so deep that the
   tallest men can drown in them when they are filled with water,
   as they are now filled, imagination cannot conceive the picture
   of this slough of despond. The London men had to wade and haul
   out one leg after the other from deep sucking bog as though
   in glue, and sank above their waists. A rescue party led by a
   Sergeant-Major could not haul out men, breast-high in the bog,
   until they had surrounded them with duck-boards and fastened
   ropes to them. Our barrage went ahead, the enemy’s barrage came
   down, and from the German blockhouses came a chattering fire of
   machine guns, and in the great stretch of swamp they struggled.

   And not far away from them, but invisible in their own trouble
   among the pits, the Artists’ Rifles, Bedfords, and Shropshires
   were trying to get forward to other blockhouses on the way
   to the rising ground beyond the Paddebeeke. The Artists and
   their comrades were more severely tried by shell-fire than
   the Londons. No doubt the enemy had been standing at his
   guns through the night ready to fire at the first streak of
   dawn, which might bring an English attack. A light went up
   and instantly there roared a great sweep of fire from heavy
   batteries and field guns; 4.2’s and 5.9’s fell densely and in
   depth and this bombardment did not slacken for hours. It was a
   tragic time for our men, struggling in the slime with their feet
   dragged down. They suffered but did not retreat: no man turned
   back but either fell under the shell-fire or went on.”

And in a subsequent letter he wrote:--

   “The London Regiment and the Royal Fusiliers fought this battle,
   and not far from them were the Artists’ Rifles--the dear old
   ‘Artists,’ who, in the old volunteer days, looked so dandy
   in their grey and silver across the lawns of Wimbledon. They
   suffered yesterday in hellish fire, and made heavy sacrifices
   to prove their quality. It was a fight against the elements,
   in league with the German explosives, and it was a frightful
   combination for the boys of London and the clean-shaven fellows
   of the Naval Brigade.”

    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
