PREFACE.


Books, like individuals, have their histories, and it seems but
proper that in introducing them somewhat of their ancestry should be
detailed. The present book originated in this wise: the publishers
of the RAILROAD GAZETTE procured a copy of the “Katechismus der
Einrichtung und des Betriebes der Locomotive,” by Georg Kosak. As no
English translation of this excellent little book was known to be in
existence, the editors of the above paper determined to translate
it and adapt it to the American practice in the construction and
management of locomotive steam engines, and republish it in their
journal. The translation was therefore made and submitted to the writer
for revision and adaptation, according to the original intention.
Before the latter was entertained, however, he had commenced writing
an elementary treatise on the locomotive. In revising the first part
of the translation of Mr. Kosak’s book, it was found that the latter
occupied only to a very limited extent the ground which the writer had
“staked out” in his own incomplete plan. He therefore concluded to
abandon the original intention of “adapting” Mr. Kosak’s work, and
determined to rewrite it and make substantially a new book of it. For
the “idea,” however, and to some extent its plan, and for much valuable
material, the author must acknowledge his indebtedness to Mr. Kosak.
In some few cases the language of the translator has been employed, in
part or in whole, without quotation marks, but with an acknowledgment
in a foot-note. A similar plan has also been pursued in using some
other books. This was done to avoid cutting up paragraphs and sentences
into fragmentary parts with numerous quotation marks.

The following books have been consulted and used in writing the
Catechism of the Locomotive: Heat considered as a Mode of Motion, by
Prof. Tyndall; The Conservation of Energy, by Balfour Stewart; Railway
Machinery, by D. K. Clark; Treatise on the Locomotive Engine, by Zerah
Colburn; Treatise on the Steam Engine, by W. J. M. Rankine; Indicator
Experiments on Locomotives, by Professor Bauschinger; Richards’ Steam
Indicator, by Charles T. Porter; Die Schule des Locomotivführers, by J.
Brosius and R. Koch; Mechanics, by A. Morin; The New Chemistry, by J.
P. Cooke, Jr.; Combustion of Coal and the Prevention of Smoke, by C.
Wye Williams; A Treatise on Steam Boilers, by Robert Wilson; Reports of
the American Railway Master Mechanics’ Association; Link Valve Motion,
by William S. Auchincloss, and Emergencies and How to Treat Them, by
Dr. Joseph W. Howe.

For the title of the book an apology is perhaps needed, as the word
Catechism is associated in nearly all persons’ minds we will trust
with early religious and theological instruction, and therefore a
Catechism of the Locomotive is very apt to sound more ludicrous than
scientific. The title of Mr. Kosak’s book was adopted before it was
determined to rewrite it, and it was afterwards not deemed best to
change it. To those who are disposed to smile at it, the precedent
of Mr. Bourne’s excellent Catechism of the Steam Engine is quoted,
and if they will refer to Webster’s Dictionary for the definition of
the word “catechism,” they will find that it means “an elementary
book containing a summary of principles in any science or art, but
appropriately in religion, reduced to the form of questions and
answers, and sometimes with notes, explanations and reference to
authorities,” which is exactly what the present book is intended to be.

To persons accustomed to books and study, the catechetical form is
very apt to seem cumbrous and awkward, but it has some very decided
advantages in writing for those who have not acquired studious habits
of thought. To such the question asked presents first a distinct image
of the subject to be considered, so that the explanation or instruction
which follows is much more apt to be understood than it would be if no
such question had been asked.

The author is indebted to Mr. D. B. Grant for the use of drawings from
which most of the engravings of details of locomotives with which this
book is illustrated have been made, and to other locomotive builders,
whose engines are illustrated in the full-page plates, for the drawings
thereof. He has also received very valuable aid from Mr. Richard H.
Buel, Mechanical Engineer; Mr. William Buchanan, Master Mechanic
of the Hudson River Railroad; Mr. Frank D. Child, Superintendent
of the Hinkley Locomotive Works; and Mr. E. T. Jeffrey, Assistant
Superintendent of Machinery of the Illinois Central Railroad.

The object in writing the book was to furnish a clear and easily
understood description of the principles, construction and operation
of the locomotive engine of the present day, a subject which is not
concisely or adequately treated in any one similar book. If the author
has succeeded in making what he has written plain to plain people, his
aim will be fully accomplished.

INTRODUCTION.


The Catechism of the Locomotive is intended for a large class of
readers, among whom are all kinds of railroad officers and employes,
consisting of locomotive runners, firemen, and the many different
kinds of mechanics employed in railroad shops and in the construction
of locomotive and other kinds of railroad machinery and material.
Besides these there are many amateur engineers, students, and
persons interested directly or indirectly in railroads, and a not
inconsiderable class who are always seeking information on all subjects
whatsoever. It is evident, therefore, that the only way to adapt the
book to all the classes for whom it is intended, was to make it so
plain that the “wayfaring man” will have no difficulty in comprehending
it. It has therefore been written in as clear language as the writer
could command, and the subjects presented are treated as simply and as
plainly as his ability enabled him to do, and with the least possible
employment of either scientific or practical technicalities. The
only deviation from this plan will be found in the use of algebraic
symbols to designate arithmetical calculations. This was done to save
space, and because it was thought that they could be explained so that
even those without any knowledge whatsoever of algebra could easily
comprehend them. To such as have no such knowledge the following
explanation is given:

Suppose it is necessary to add two numbers, say 1,872 and 468. The
calculation, if made arithmetically, would be thus:

  1,872
    468
  -----
  2,340

This it will be seen occupies the space of several lines of print. If
we want to express this calculation algebraically, it can be done by
simply writing the two numbers and placing the sign +, called _plus_,
between the two, which indicates that they are to be added together,
thus:

  1,872 + 468

To indicate what the _sum_ will be, or what the two added together will
amount to, the sign =, called _equal to_, or the sign of equality, is
placed after the two numbers and between them and the sum, thus:

  1,872 + 468 = 2,340,

which can be read as follows:

  1,872 _added to_ 468 _is equal to_ 2,340.

Now the only use of the algebraic signs + and = is that they save time
in writing and room in printing, and when persons become accustomed to
their use they make plain a number of operations at a single glance, as
will be shown hereafter.

In the same way that the sign + means _added to_, the sign - means
_less_ or subtracted from, thus:

  1,872 - 468 = 1,404,

which is the same as though it was printed as follows:

  1,872 _less_ 468 _is equal to_ 1,404.

The sign × means _multiplied by_, or is the sign of multiplication.
Thus:

  1,872 × 468 = 876,096;

that is,

  1,872 _multiplied by_ 468 _is equal to_ 876,096.

The sign ÷ means divided by, thus:

  1,872 ÷ 468 = 4.

which means:

  1,872 _divided by_ 468 _is equal to_ 4.

The same thing is expressed by putting a line under the dividend and
writing the divisor under the line, thus:

  1,872
  ----- = 4.
   468

These signs are combined in various ways. Thus, supposing we wanted to
add 1,872 to 468 and then divide the sum by 117, it would be necessary,
in order to represent the arithmetical calculation, to do it as
follows:

      1872
       468
      ----
  117)2340(20
      234
     ----
        0

Algebraically it would be stated thus:

  1872 + 468
  ---------- = 20
     117

If you wanted to add 124 to the quotient 20 above, the calculation
would be as follows:

      1872
       468
      ----
  117)2340( 20
      234  124
      ---- ---
         0 144

This operation could be expressed by writing it as follows:

  1872 + 468
  ---------- + 124 = 144.
     117

If we wanted to multiply the quotient 20 by 124 we would simply put the
sign × instead of + before 124, thus:

  1872 + 468
  ---------- × 124 = 2480.
     117

The sign of subtraction or division can be used in the same way.

With these explanations it is believed that any one, with nothing more
than an ordinary knowledge of the four elementary rules of arithmetic,
can understand all the mathematics contained in the following pages.
A little explanation may also be needed of the method of representing
machinery and other structures by mechanical drawings.

[Illustration:

  A
  B
  C
  D]

If we want to represent the outside of any object, say an apple, we
make a drawing of it as shown at _A_. Now if we want to show the
inside of the apple, say the seeds and core, we can cut it in half and
represent it as shown at _C_, which is then called a _section_ or
_sectional view_ of the apple. If we represent it as it will appear if
we are above it and looking down on it as shown at _B_, it is called a
_top view_ or _plan_.

It is evident, too, that it might be desirable to show the arrangement
of the seeds in the apple as they would appear if it was cut through in
the other direction, say on the line _a b_, fig. _A_, and as is shown
at _D_. There are therefore two kinds of sections; one _C_, in which
the object is supposed to be cut through vertically, and therefore
called a _vertical section_, the other when the object is supposed
to be cut through horizontally, and therefore called a _horizontal
section_, as shown at _D_.

It is also evident that in looking at a locomotive or any other
object, the appearance of the engine depends upon our position in
relation to it. Thus, if we stand on the side of it, we see that part
of the engine, and a drawing which represents the side, is therefore
called a _side view_ or _side elevation_. A drawing which represents
a locomotive or other object as it would appear to us if we stood in
front of it, is called a _front view_ or _front elevation_, and a
representation of the back part of any object as it would appear to
us if we stood behind it is called a _back view_ or _back elevation_.
Plate I is a side view, Plate II a section, Plate III a top view or
plan;[1] the vignette in the title page is a front view and fig. 71 a
back view of a locomotive. If the drawing is made as the object would
appear if it was turned upside down, and we were looking at it from
above, then it is called an _inverted plan_.

  [1] The boiler of the locomotive is supposed to be removed in Plate
  III.

It is obvious, too, that it is possible to make a great many different
sectional views of nearly any object, especially of a machine. Thus, we
could suppose a locomotive cut through vertically and lengthwise, as
is shown in Plate II. Such a representation is called a _longitudinal_
section. A locomotive could also be cut through crosswise, as shown
in fig. 40, which is called a _transverse section_. It is of course
possible to represent a transverse section of a machine like a
locomotive at a great many different points; for example, it could be
shown as though it was cut through the smoke-stack as in fig. 40, or
through the boiler farther back, as the latter is shown in fig. 42.
Usually when a section is shown through a cylindrical object like a
smoke-stack or boiler, it is shown through its centre. If, however,
this is not apparent from the drawing or engraving, it should be stated
at what point it is supposed to be taken, thus the section _D_ of the
apple is on the line _a b_ of fig. _A_, and the section _C_ is on the
line _c d_.

In drawing sections, the parts which are supposed to be cut in two are
usually shaded with parallel diagonal lines drawn at equal distances
apart, as shown in the sections of the apple at _C_ and _D_. Sections
are also sometimes represented with solid black surfaces, as in Plates
II and III, and in the engraving of a pump in fig. 66.

Objects which are behind others which are in front of them are often
shown with dotted lines, so as to indicate their position. The seeds of
the apple are thus indicated at _A_.

It is also customary, in drawings of machinery, to take great liberties
with the objects represented and to show them with parts removed or
broken away, if their construction can thus be made plainer. It should
be remembered that the purpose of drawings of this kind is not to give
a pictorial representation of the object as it appears to the eye, but
to make its construction and mode of operation apparent to the mind.
In such drawings therefore all perspective is disregarded. It would
lead us too far were we to explain the reasons for this, and therefore
readers must accept the assertion without the proof.




CATECHISM OF THE LOCOMOTIVE.




PART I.

THE STEAM ENGINE.


QUESTION 1. _What is the motive power employed in ordinary steam
engines?_

_Answer._ The expansive force of steam.

QUESTION 2. _How is this expansive force of steam applied?_

[Illustration: _Fig. 1._

Scale ³⁄₈ in. = 1 foot.

  _A._ Cylinder.
  _B._ Piston.
  _R._ Piston-Rod.
  _D._ Front Cylinder-Head.
  _C._ Back Cylinder-Head.]

_Answer._ It is applied by admitting it into a _cylinder_ (_A_, fig.
1) in which a _piston_, _B_, is fitted so as to move air-tight from
one end of the cylinder to the other. The steam, if admitted at _C_,
will force the piston _B_ to the opposite end[2] of the cylinder.
When it has reached that end, if the steam is allowed to escape and a
fresh supply is admitted to the cylinder through the opening _d_, it
will move the piston back again. In this way, by alternately admitting
steam at one end and exhausting it from the other, the piston receives
a _reciprocating motion_, which is communicated to the outside of
the cylinder by a rod, _R_, which is called the _piston-rod_, which
works air-tight through an opening in one of the _cylinder-covers_, or
_cylinder-heads_, as they are usually called.

  [2] In all ordinary locomotives, the cylinders are so placed that
  the head _C_ through which the piston-rod works is behind, and the
  other head _D_ in front. The two ends of the cylinder are therefore
  designated the _front_ and _back ends_, respectively.

[Illustration: _Fig. 2._

  _R._ Piston-Rod.
  _c._ and _d._ Steam-ways.

  _L._ Eccentric-Rod.
  _E._ Connecting-Rod.
  _P._ Crank.
  _N._ Crank-Pin.]

[Illustration: _Fig. 4._

  _c._ and _d._ Steam-Ports.
  _g._ Exhaust-Port.]

[Illustration: _Fig. 5._

Scale ³⁄₈ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 3. _How is this reciprocating motion of the piston converted
into rotary motion?_

_Answer._ By connecting the end of the piston-rod _R_ (fig. 2) by
another rod, _E_; called a _connecting-rod_, with a crank, _P_, which
is attached to a revolving shaft, _S_. It is apparent that if the
piston _B_ is moved in the direction shown by the dart _R_, a rotary
motion will be given to the crank in the direction of the dart _N_.
When, however, the crank reaches the position shown by the dotted lines
in fig. 5, it is plain that a force applied to move the piston in
either direction will no longer produce a rotary movement of the crank
and shaft. The same thing will occur when the crank is in the opposite
position, shown by the full lines. These two positions are called the
_dead-points_ of the crank.

QUESTION 4. _How is the crank of an ordinary steam engine carried past
the dead-points?_

_Answer._ Stationary engines are usually provided with a large and
heavy wheel, called a _fly-wheel_ (_F F_, fig. 2) which is attached to
the shaft _S_. This wheel receives a sufficient amount of momentum from
the crank, while the latter is moving from one dead-point to the other,
to carry it past those points.

QUESTION 5. _How is the steam admitted to and exhausted from the
cylinder?_

_Answer._ It is admitted through two channels, _c_, _d_, fig. 2, called
_steam-ways_, cast in the cylinder. These ways terminate in a smooth
flat surface, _f f_, called the _valve-seat_. Their openings in the
valve-seat are called _steam-ports_. Between them is another port or
cavity, _g_, called the _exhaust-port_, which communicates with the
open air. The form of these ports is long and narrow, as shown in fig.
4, which represents a plan of them. Over these ports a valve, _V_,
called a _slide-valve_, usually made of cast iron, with a cavity,
_H_, on its under side, is fitted so that by moving it backwards or
forwards it will alternately cover and uncover the two steam-ports.
The valve and valve-seat are inclosed in a sort of box, _I I_, fig.
2, made of cast iron, called a _steam-chest_, into which steam is
admitted from the boiler by a pipe, _J_. When the valve is in the
position represented in fig. 2, the front steam-port is uncovered and
the steam is admitted to the front end of the cylinder, and thus forces
the piston towards the back end. If, when the piston reaches the back
end, the valve be moved into the position shown in fig. 3, the back
steam-port will be uncovered and steam will be admitted to that end of
the cylinder. At the same time it will be observed that the aperture of
the front steam-port _c_ and that of the exhaust-port are both covered
by the cavity in the slide-valve, so that the steam which was admitted
to the front end of the cylinder can escape through the steam-port _c_
into the exhaust-port, and thus into the open air. In this way, by
moving the valve alternately back and forth, steam is simultaneously
admitted first to one end and exhausted from the other, and _vice
versa_.

[Illustration: _Fig. 6._

  _G._ Eccentric.
  _K. K._ Eccentric-Strap.
  _L._ Eccentric-Rod.]

QUESTION 6. _How is the slide-valve moved so as to admit and exhaust
the steam at the right time?_

_Answer._ This is done by what is called an _eccentric_, which is a
circular disc, _G_ (fig. 6), the axis of which is not in the centre.
The outside of the eccentric is embraced by a metal ring, _K K_, made
in two halves, called an _eccentric-strap_. The eccentric is attached
to the shaft by screws or keys, and revolves with it and inside of
the eccentric-strap. To the latter is also attached a rod, _L_, called
an _eccentric-rod_. It is obvious from fig. 6 that if the eccentric
revolves inside of the strap it will impart a reciprocating motion
to the rod _L_. The eccentric, _G_, strap, _K_, and rod, _L_, are
represented in fig. 2. Before describing their operation, or rather
their connection with the valve _V_, it is necessary to understand
that usually the valve-seat is placed on top of the cylinder, in which
position it is difficult to connect the eccentric-rod with the valve.
For convenience, therefore, what is called a _rocker_, _r r_, is placed
between the cylinder and the main shaft of the engine. This rocker has
two arms attached to a shaft, _s_, and the two arms have a vibratory
motion about it, as indicated by the dotted lines. The eccentric-rod
_L_ is attached by a pin to the lower arm of the rocker, and the valve
is connected to the upper arm by the rod _M_, called the _valve-stem_,
or _valve-rod_. It is obvious that as the shaft _S_ and eccentric _G_
revolve, a reciprocating or vibratory motion will be given to the
rocker, which will be communicated to the valve by the valve-stem; and
it is only necessary to fix the eccentric in the proper position on
the shaft, in relation to the crank and piston, to give the valve the
required motion for admitting and exhausting the steam to and from the
cylinder at the right time.




PART II.

THE FORCES OF AIR AND STEAM.


QUESTION 7. _What is meant by the pressure of the air?_

_Answer._ It is the pressure exerted by the weight of the air on
every point with which it is in contact. The globe of the earth is
surrounded by a layer of air about 50 miles thick, and, like every
other substance, the air possesses weight, and hence presses upon every
object with which it is in contact.

QUESTION 8. _How can it be shown that the air possesses weight?_

_Answer._ By weighing a flask when it is filled with air, and again
when the air is exhausted from it. In the latter condition the weight
of the flask will be found to be sensibly less than it was when full of
air, showing that the air which the flask contained when it was first
weighed increased its weight.

QUESTION 9. _Why do we not feel this pressure on our bodies?_

_Answer._ Because the air surrounds us on all sides, and presses
just as much in one direction as it does in another, so that the
pressures in different directions just balance each other, or are _in
equilibrium_; but if you disturb this balance, for example, by sucking
the air from a tube closed at one end, it will cling to your tongue;
or if you take a thick piece of leather under ordinary conditions it
will not adhere to anything, but if it be thoroughly wet and pressed
hard against the surface of a smooth stone, so as to force out the air
from under it, the stone, as nearly all school-boys know, can be lifted
up if a string is attached to the leather; or if the air be sucked
out of a tube, one end of which is inserted in a liquid, the latter
will be forced up the tube. These phenomena are due to the pressure of
the atmosphere in the first case on one side of the person’s tongue,
pressing it against the mouth of the tube; in the second, to the same
pressure on the top of the leather, causing it to adhere to the stone;
and in the last, to the weight of the air pressing on the surface of
the liquid, forcing it into the vacuum in the tube.

[Illustration: _Fig. 7._

Scale ¹⁄₄.]

QUESTION 10. _What is the amount of the pressure of the atmosphere, and
how is it measured?_

_Answer._ It is usually measured by the pressure on one square inch of
surface, which at the earth’s surface is 15 pounds.[3] If, for example,
we have a cylinder, _A_, fig. 7, with an air-tight piston, _B_, fitted
to it whose area is just one square inch, if we exhaust the air through
the tube _C_ from the cylinder above the piston, the air will press
against the under side of the piston so that, if no power is required
to overcome its friction in the cylinder, the pressure of the air will
raise a weight of 15 pounds. The pressure of the air varies, however,
as you ascend or descend from the surface of the earth, because as
you go up on a mountain or in a balloon the layer of air above you
becomes thinner, and, therefore, its weight and consequent pressure
are diminished; and as you descend, as in a deep mine, the layer is
thicker, and its pressure consequently greater.

  [3] In common practice it is generally taken at 15 lbs. per square
  inch, but the average atmospheric pressure is more accurately 14.7
  pounds.

QUESTION 11. _What is steam?_

_Answer._ Steam is water changed by means of heat into a gas. At every
temperature there is formed from water, on its surface, vapor of which
the clouds are formed at all seasons of the year. This change of water
into vapor, or evaporation of water, takes place at low temperatures
only on its surface, however. But if we heat water in a vessel to a
temperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit, then the inner particles of the
mass of water (lying on the heating surface of the vessel) are changed
into steam, and rise to the surface in bubbles, which is the phenomenon
we call _boiling_. It must not be imagined, however, that the visible
cloud which escapes from a kettle or the exhaust-pipe of a steam engine
is true steam. It is rather small particles of water, into which the
steam has condensed through contact with the cold air. True steam
is invisible, as we may observe near the mouth of a kettle or the
exhaust-pipe of an engine from which we know it is escaping.

QUESTION 12. _If water is heated in an open vessel what occurs?_

_Answer._ It continues for some time to increase in temperature, and
the evaporation becomes more and more rapid. At length bubbles of
vapor break out and reach the surface, and the process of boiling or
ebullition has begun. When this takes place the temperature of the
water ceases to rise, and it remains stationary until all the water
has boiled away, the only difference being that if the supply of heat
be very great the process is very rapid, and if the supply of heat be
small the process is very slow. The point at which ebullition commences
is called the _boiling-point_.

QUESTION 13. _On what does the boiling-point depend?_

_Answer._ Chiefly on the pressure on the surface of the water, but
to some extent upon the purity of the water. Thus, boiling, which
takes place at 212 degrees under the ordinary atmospheric pressure,
in lighter air, as on high mountains, takes place at a much lower
temperature than on lowlands, and so water boils in a glass tube from
which the air has been exhausted by the warmth of the hand, that is, at
92 degrees.

QUESTION 14. _What is the pressure of steam which escapes from boiling
water in an open vessel?_

_Answer._ It is exactly equal to the pressure of the atmosphere in
which it is boiled. Ordinarily this is 15 lbs., and the boiling-point
212 degrees; but if we go up on a mountain where the atmospheric
pressure is only 10 lbs. per square inch, the water will then boil at
a temperature of 193.3 degrees, and the steam which escapes will have
the same pressure as the atmosphere, or 10 lbs. per square inch. On
the other hand, if we could go down into a mine where the atmospheric
pressure was 20 lbs. per square inch, the water would not boil until it
was heated to 228 degrees, and the pressure of the escaping steam would
then be 20 lbs. per square inch.

QUESTION 15. _If water is boiled in an enclosed vessel like a covered
tea-kettle or a steam boiler, what occurs?_

_Answer._ The steam rises and fills the space above the water, and, if
it cannot escape, increases in pressure. The temperature of both the
water and the steam rises with the pressure, and will continue to do so
as long as the heat is increased, or until the steam can escape or the
vessel is exploded. The boiling point also rises as the steam pressure
increases.

QUESTION 16. _Is there any pressure which corresponds to the
temperature of steam and water?_

_Answer._ Yes. There is a fixed pressure for every temperature, when
steam is in contact with water, and its pressure cannot be increased
or diminished without at the same time heating or cooling the water,
and the higher the temperature of the water the greater will be the
corresponding steam pressure. Thus water at 212 degrees produces
steam with a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere; at 240 degrees
the steam will have a pressure of 25 lbs., or 10 lbs. more than the
atmospheric pressure; at 281 degrees a pressure of 50 lbs.; and at 328
degrees, 100 lbs. As this relation of pressure to temperature is fixed,
if we know the one we can tell the other. This is true, however, only
where the steam is in contact with water, when it is called _saturated
steam_. If it is separated from water it may be heated to a higher
temperature, and is then called _superheated steam_.

QUESTION 17. _How is the pressure of steam measured?_

_Answer._ In the same way as that of the atmosphere,--that is, by the
force exerted on one square inch of surface. Thus if steam is admitted
into the cylinder _A_, fig. 8, under the piston _B_, whose area is
equal to one square inch of surface, supposing, as we did before, that
no power is required to overcome its friction in the cylinder, if the
steam thus admitted would just balance the atmosphere, its pressure
would be equal to 15 lbs. If, besides overcoming the pressure of the
atmosphere, it would raise a weight of 15 lbs., then its pressure per
square inch would be equal to 30 lbs. When the atmospheric pressure
is _included_ with that of the steam, we call it the _absolute steam
pressure_. In ordinary engines, however, the steam must always overcome
the pressure of the atmosphere, and therefore the only part of the
pressure which is effective is that above, or by which it exceeds, the
atmospheric pressure. For example, although the steam admitted under
the piston in fig. 8 has an absolute pressure of 30 lbs. per square
inch, yet it will only raise a weight of 15 lbs., because it must first
overcome the pressure of the air on the other side of the piston. The
pressure of the steam used in most stationary and in locomotive engines
is, therefore, measured by its pressure above the atmosphere. That is,
if steam introduced under the piston in fig. 8 will raise a weight of
only 15 lbs., we say it has a pressure of 15 lbs. per square inch; if
it will raise 50 lbs., its pressure is said to be 50 lbs. per square
inch, and so on. The pressure of the atmosphere is disregarded, and all
steam-gauges used on locomotives are graduated in that way. In speaking
of steam pressure in future, therefore, unless otherwise specified, we
shall mean _effective_ and not _absolute_ pressure.

[Illustration: _Fig. 8._

Scale ¹⁄₄.]

QUESTION 18. _What is meant by the expansion of steam?_

_Answer._ In all gases a repulsion is exerted between the various
particles, so that any gas, however small in quantity, will always fill
the vessel in which it is held. Steam possesses this same property, and
if placed in any vessel the particles in endeavoring to separate from
each other will exert a force on all its sides. This force we call the
steam pressure. To illustrate this we will suppose that the cylinder
_A_ in fig. 8 is half filled with steam of 30 lbs. pressure. If now the
supply of steam is shut off, the steam in the cylinder will expand so
as to push the piston upward, but with a somewhat diminishing force,
the nature of which we will explain hereafter.

QUESTION 19. _What is meant by the volume of steam?_

_Answer._ It means the space which the steam occupies.

QUESTION 20. _What is the proportion which exists between the volume
and the pressure of steam?_

_Answer._ If the temperatures remain the same they are INVERSELY
PROPORTIONAL TO EACH OTHER; that is, the one increases in the same
proportion as the other diminishes. If we admit steam of 30 lbs.
pressure per square inch into the cylinder _A_, fig. 8, and then cut
off the supply by closing the cock _C_ and allow the steam in the
cylinder to expand to double its volume by pushing the piston to the
end of the cylinder, the steam pressure will then be only 15 lbs.; if
it should expand to three times its volume its pressure would be only
one-third, or 10 lbs. per square inch. This method for calculating
the pressure of steam after it has expanded is correct only for the
_absolute_ and not for the _effective_ pressures of steam. In order
to ascertain the effective pressures of steam after expansion, it is
only necessary to make the calculation with the absolute pressure and
deduct the atmospheric pressure from the result. If, after being thus
expanded, the piston be pushed down again so as to compress the steam
into its original space, its pressure will again be 30 lbs., providing
no heat has been lost in any way.

QUESTION 21. _With a cylinder of any given stroke_[4] _how can we
determine approximately the pressure of the steam after expansion for
any given point of cut-off?_[5]

  [4] The _stroke_ of a piston is the distance it moves in the
  cylinder, and in ordinary engines is always twice the length of the
  crank measured from center to center of the shaft and crank-pin.

  [5] The steam is said to be _cut off_ when the steam-port by which
  steam is admitted to the cylinder is closed by the valve.

_Answer._ BY MULTIPLYING THE ABSOLUTE PRESSURE PER SQUARE INCH OF
THE STEAM IN THE CYLINDER BEFORE IT IS CUT OFF, BY THE DISTANCE FROM
THE BEGINNING OF THE STROKE AT WHICH IT IS CUT OFF, AND DIVIDING THE
PRODUCT BY THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE STROKE. Thus, if we have a cylinder
whose piston has a stroke of 24 inches, if we cut off the steam at 8
inches, and have an ABSOLUTE pressure of 90 lbs. in the cylinder, the
calculation is as follows:

  90 × 8
  ------ = 30 lbs. final pressure.
    24

If we cut off at 10, 12 and 15 inches, the final pressure would be
37¹⁄₂, 50 and 56¹⁄₄ lbs., respectively. To get the effective pressure
deduct the atmospheric pressure from this result.

QUESTION 22. _What is the proportion between the volume of steam and
that of the water from which it is formed?_

_Answer._ At the pressure of the atmosphere (15 lbs.) each cubic
inch of water will make 1,610 cubic inches of steam. At double that
pressure, or 30 lbs. absolute pressure, it will make a little more than
half as much, or 838 cubic inches; at four times, or 60 lbs. absolute
pressure, 437 cubic inches, or a little more than a fourth as much as
at the pressure of the atmosphere.

QUESTION 23. _Why is it that the quantity of steam at high pressures is
somewhat greater than in inverse proportion to the pressure?_

_Answer._ Because the boiling-point of water, as has already been
explained, is higher as the pressure increases, and therefore the
temperature of the steam produced at such pressure is also higher than
at lower pressures; and as all gases are expanded by heat, therefore
the volume of steam at the higher pressures is somewhat greater than
in inverse proportion to its pressure, on account of being somewhat
expanded by its high temperature. To make this plain, if we take a
cubic inch of water and convert it into steam of atmospheric pressure,
its volume will be 1,610 times that of the water, and its temperature
212 degrees.[6] If we convert this quantity of water into steam with a
pressure double that of the atmosphere, the volume of the steam will be
838 times that of the water and its temperature will be 250.4 degrees.
If the volume of the steam were exactly _inversely proportional_ to the
pressure, the cubic inch of water at double the atmospheric pressure
would make only 805 cubic inches of steam; but as the boiling-point at
that pressure is 38.4 degrees higher, the steam is expanded 33 cubic
inches by the increase of its heat due to the higher boiling-point.

  [6] More accurately, 213.1 degrees, if we call the atmospheric
  pressure 15 lbs., as we have.

A table in the appendix gives the pressure, temperature and volume of
saturated steam up to 300 lbs. absolute pressure.

QUESTION 24. _What is meant by the condensation of steam?_

_Answer._ It is the reconversion of steam into water by cooling it,
or depriving it of part of its heat. It has been shown that the
temperature of water must be raised to a certain point to generate
steam of a given pressure. If the process is reversed, and we deprive
the steam of a part of its heat, some of the steam is then at once
reconverted into water, or _condensed_, and the pressure of that which
remains will be reduced just in proportion as the heat is lost. When
the temperature gets below 212 degrees under atmospheric pressure,
all the steam will be condensed. As the useful work which steam can
do in an engine is due to its pressure, which in turn depends on its
temperature, any loss of heat will diminish its effective power. For
this reason, all waste of heat from a steam engine should, as far as
possible, be prevented.

QUESTION 25. _How is the heat of the steam wasted or lost in an
ordinary steam engine?_

_Answer._ It is wasted in three ways: first, by _conduction_; second,
by _convection_; and third, by _radiation_.

QUESTION 26. _What is meant by these three terms?_

_Answer._ 1. By _conduction_ is meant that phenomenon which is
manifested when we put one end of a metal bar two or three feet long
into the fire and heat it. The heat is then gradually conveyed from one
particle of the metal to that next to it until finally the end of the
bar farthest from the fire becomes so hot that it cannot be touched.
The heat is then said to be _conducted_ through the bar. In the same
way the metal of the boiler, pipes, cylinders and other parts of the
engine becomes heated on one side, and the heat is thus conveyed to the
outside of these parts.

2. The air with which they are surrounded then becomes heated, and
being then lighter than the cold air, it rises and is again replaced
with air which is not heated. In this way the heat is conveyed away by
the air, and this phenomena is therefore called _convection_.

3. If an iron plate be placed in front of an ordinary grate fire three
or four feet from it and exposed to the rays of heat from the fire, it
will soon become so hot that you cannot bear your hand on it. If you
place your hand between the iron plate and the fire you will find that
only the side of your hand which is exposed to the fire will become
hot, showing that the air between the plate and the fire is not nearly
so hot as the plate soon becomes, and therefore that the heat is not
conveyed to the plate by the air between it and the fire, but by the
rays from the fire. This phenomenon is called _radiation_. The same
thing occurs from any hot body, as for example a coil of steam pipe for
heating a room, a steam boiler or cylinder of an engine.

QUESTION 27. _Is there any difference in the conducting and radiating
power of different substances?_

_Answer._ Yes, very great. The difference in the _conducting_ power
of wood and iron is shown if we place one end of a bar of each in the
fire. The wood will be consumed without warming the bar more than a
few inches from the fire, whereas the iron will soon become hot two or
three feet from the fire. Owing to the difference in the conducting
power of cotton and wool, we wear cotton clothing in summer and woolen
in winter, because cotton allows the heat of the body to be conducted
away from it, whereas woolen cloth prevents to a great degree this
loss of heat. For the same reason, the venders of roasted chestnuts
on our streets wrap them in a piece of blanket to keep them hot, that
is, to keep the heat in; and in summer we wrap ice in the same way to
keep it cold, that is, keep the warmth of the air out. The wool, being
a very bad conductor of heat, simply prevents the heat from being
transferred from the inside to the outside, and _vice versa_. It is for
this reason that steam boilers, pipes and cylinders are nearly always
covered with wood, and sometimes with felt.

The difference in the _radiating_ power of various substances can be
shown if we take a large thermometer and heat it up to the temperature
of boiling water. If this thermometer is hung up in a room having the
temperature of melting ice, it will lose heat in two ways,--first by
heating the air which surrounds it, that is by _convection_, and also
by _radiation_. In order to confine ourselves to the latter process, we
will suppose that the chamber is a vacuum. If we first cover the bulb
of the thermometer with a thin coating of polished silver, and then
ascertain how much heat it radiates in a minute, and then coat it with
lamp-black, and repeat the same experiment,--that is to say, allow the
thermometer at the boiling-point to cool for one minute in a vacuum
chamber at the freezing-point,--it will be found that the thermometer
loses much more in a minute when coated with lamp-black than it did
when coated with silver, showing that much more heat is radiated from a
surface covered with lamp-black than from polished silver. Generally it
may be stated that polished metals radiate much less heat than surfaces
which are not polished.[7] For this reason, as well as for ornament,
locomotive and other boilers and cylinders are usually covered with
Russia iron or polished brass.

  [7] The account of the above experiment is copied from Balfour
  Stewart’s very excellent little book, “Lessons in Elementary
  Physics,” of which, and the same author’s “Elementary Treatise on
  Heat,” the writer has made frequent use.




PART III.

ON WORK, ENERGY, AND THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT.


QUESTION 28. _For what purpose are all steam engines used?_

_Answer._ They are used to produce _motion_, which is opposed by some
_resistance_. Thus, if an engine is employed to raise grain from a
railroad car to the top of a warehouse, it must produce motion, which
is resisted by the weight of the grain; if it is used to saw wood, it
must give motion to the saw, which is resisted by the fibres of the
wood; a locomotive engine must produce motion of a train of cars, which
is resisted by the air, the friction of the journals and the rolling of
the wheels on the track; if the locomotive is employed on a grade or
incline, besides the frictional resistance referred to it must overcome
that due to its own weight and that of the train, which is gradually
lifted as it ascends the incline. In producing motion opposed by some
resistance an engine is said to be doing “_work_.”

QUESTION 29. _Can this work be accurately measured?_

_Answer._ Yes; but in order to measure anything we must first establish
some accurate standard or unit of measurement. Thus we say a bar of
iron is so many inches long, or a road is so many miles long. In like
manner we speak of so many seconds, or minutes, or hours, or days, or
years, when we speak of time. So it is necessary, in order to estimate
or measure “_work_” in a strictly scientific manner, for us to fix upon
some accurate standard or unit. In this country and in Great Britain
the unit agreed upon for this purpose is the amount of power required
to raise ONE POUND ONE FOOT, and is called a _foot-pound_. If we raise
one pound two feet we do two foot-pounds of work; if three feet, three
foot-pounds, and so on. Again, if we raise a weight of two pounds one
foot high, we likewise do two foot-pounds of work; or if we raise it
two feet high, we do four foot-pounds, and so on. In order to determine
the amount of work done, we must MULTIPLY THE MOTION PRODUCED (_in
feet_) BY THE RESISTANCE (_in pounds_), AND THE RESULT WILL BE THE WORK
DONE IN FOOT-POUNDS.

QUESTION 30. _How many foot-pounds of work are performed in a
pile-driving machine in raising a weight of 1,200 lbs. 24 feet?_

_Answer._ 1,200 × 24 = 28,800 foot-pounds.

QUESTION 31. _When this weight is raised, is the force which was
exerted in raising it annihilated or lost?_

_Answer._ No; because the weight has the capacity of doing an equal
amount of work when it falls, from the momentum[8] it acquires in
falling. This _power of doing work_ which it acquires in falling is
called _energy_. Now, although the weight has no motion-producing power
when it is raised to the top of the machine, yet obviously such action
is then _possible_ which when it rested on the earth was not possible.
It has no energy as it hangs there dead and motionless; but energy is
possible to it, and we might fairly use the term _possible energy_
to express this power of motion which the weight possesses,[9] and
which is therefore called _potential energy_. As soon as the weight is
allowed to fall it acquires a greater velocity the farther it falls,
and its potential energy thus becomes and is called _actual energy_.

  [8] Momentum is not a very exact term, but is used here because it
  ordinarily conveys the idea we wish to express.

  [9] Tyndall’s “Heat Considered as a Mode of Motion.”

QUESTION 32. _How do we explain such phenomena as the heating of a
car-axle while turning under a car, the heating of brake-blocks when
the brakes are applied to car-wheels, the heating of an iron rod by
hammering, and of a turning tool when cutting a piece of metal?_

_Answer._ All of these phenomena are due to the fact that the _actual
energy_ of motion is converted into heat, as has been repeatedly proved
by many able and ingenious investigators and experiments.

QUESTION 33. _When the weight of the pile-driver falls, is its energy
also converted into heat?_

_Answer._ A part is expended in compressing the material into which
the pile is driven and in overcoming the friction of the earth against
the pile, each of which efforts develops heat, and another portion is
converted into heat by the impact or blow of the falling weight on the
head of the pile.

QUESTION 34. _Is all energy convertible into heat and heat into energy?_

_Answer._ Yes. Science has demonstrated very clearly that they are
mutually convertible.

QUESTION 35. _Has it been ascertained how much heat is equivalent to
one foot-pound of work?_

_Answer._ Yes; it has been found, from the most carefully-made
experiments that the amount of heat which is required to raise
the temperature of one pound of liquid water by one degree of
Fahrenheit[10] is equivalent to 772 foot-pounds of work. It must be
remembered that this is the theoretical equivalent of heat, and that
only a very small proportion of this amount of work is ever realized
from the heat developed by the combustion of fuel.

  [10] Thermometers are divided into different scales. The one called
  the Fahrenheit scale, after its originator, is the one ordinarily
  used in this country.

QUESTION 36. _If, then, heat is convertible into work and work into
heat, can the transmutation of the heat of the steam in the cylinder of
an engine into work, and the reverse process, be explained?_

[Illustration: _Fig. 9._

Scale ³⁄₈ in. = 1 foot.]

_Answer._ Yes. Take a cylinder, fig. 9, and, in order to make the
conditions of the experiment as simple as possible, imagine it to be
placed in a vacuum. Now let saturated steam be admitted under the
piston so as to fill the cylinder half full at an absolute pressure of
100 lbs. If we will allow this steam to expand to double its volume
and raise the piston _without doing any work_, and then repeat the
experiment with a load of 50 pounds on the piston, whose area is
one square inch, it will be found that the temperature of the steam
is sensibly less, after lifting the weight, than in the previous
experiment, in which it expanded without doing work, showing that part
of the heat was abstracted from the steam by doing work, or, in other
words, was converted into work. If then, after the steam has expanded
and lifted the weight, we press the piston down so that the steam under
the piston is compressed to its original volume, we shall find that
its temperature is the same as before, as the work done in compressing
it is converted into heat. In these experiments it is assumed that
there is no friction of the piston, nor loss of heat from radiation or
conduction. The same phenomena can be observed in machines used for
compressing air, which is heated to so high a temperature when it is
compressed that it is necessary to cool the cylinders of such machines
by circulating a current of cold water around them.

QUESTION 37. _What practical relation is there between the
convertibility of heat into work, and the conducting and radiating
properties of different substances explained in answer to Question 27?_

_Answer._ The fact that heat is only another form of energy, or
“the power of doing work,” indicates that its loss by conduction or
radiation lessens that power just as much as or more than the loss
or waste of coal would, and therefore every effort should be made to
protect the different parts of engines from loss of heat by covering
them with substances which conduct or radiate very little heat. Care
should also be taken to exclude cold air from circulating in contact
with these parts, and excepting for supporting combustion, the nature
of which will be explained hereafter, it should be excluded from the
heating surface of boilers.

QUESTION 38. _What is meant by the term_ LATENT HEAT OF EVAPORATION_?_

_Answer._ By _latent heat_ is meant that heat which _apparently_
disappears when water or other liquids are vaporized. Thus, it
is found that if any quantity of water is converted into steam at
any pressure, it is necessary not only to heat it to a temperature
equivalent to that of the steam, or to the boiling-point, but after
it has reached that temperature an additional amount of heat must be
added in order to keep up the process of boiling. Notwithstanding this
addition of heat to the water, the temperature of the steam produced
will not be higher than that of the boiling water, thus showing that a
considerable quantity of heat is absorbed, the only effect of which is
to change the water into a gas or steam. This apparent disappearance
of heat can be shown if we take a pound of boiling water whose
temperature is 212 degrees and mix it with a pound of ice-cold water
at 32 degrees. The result will be a mixture of two pounds of water of
a mean temperature of 122 degrees. If now we convert a pound of water
into steam at atmospheric pressure, the steam will heat 6.37 lbs. of
ice-cold water up to 122 degrees, showing that a pound of steam at
atmospheric pressure contains over six times as much heat as a pound
of water of the same temperature as indicated by a thermometer. A
similar apparent disappearance of heat occurs when other liquids are
evaporated, and when ice or any other solid is converted into a liquid.

QUESTION 39. _What is the explanation of these phenomena?_

_Answer._ The exact reasons which will explain them fully are probably
not yet clearly understood, but it is at least extremely probable that
when any substance is changed from a solid to a liquid, or from a
liquid to a gaseous condition, “a large portion of the heat is spent
_in doing work_ against the force of cohesion.”[11] The particles of
solid bodies, as we know, are so united that it requires more or less
force, according to the nature of the substance, to tear them apart.
Now we can conceive that the heat is changed into a form of energy,
and in that condition resists this attraction of the particles to each
other, and that being thus transformed it has lost the capacity of
expanding the mercury in the thermometer. A similar effect takes place
when a liquid is converted into a gas. In the former condition the
particles move freely about each other and have little or no attraction
for each other, but when it becomes a gas they have a _repulsion from_
each other. The heat is thus converted into the energy of repulsion,
and therefore is in reality no longer in the condition of heat and
consequently does not affect the thermometer. We can illustrate this by
supposing that by using steam heat is converted into work by raising
the weight, or drop as it is called, of a pile-driving machine. When
the weight is raised to the top of the guides from which it falls,
although, as already explained, the heat is converted into _potential
energy_, yet if we attached a thermometer to the drop we would not
find that it was any warmer than before the drop was raised. If it
were possible to make an instrument sufficiently sensitive to indicate
an instantaneous change of temperature in the weight while falling,
we would not find any increase of its temperature at the instant it
had acquired its greatest momentum and just before it struck the
object under it, although its potential energy would at that instant
be converted into _actual energy_ of motion. If, however, the weight
should strike an unyielding object, its actual energy would at once
be reconverted into heat, which our thermometer would indicate. The
phenomenon of what is called latent heat of evaporation seems to be
very similar to that described--the heat when the water is changed from
a liquid to a gaseous condition is transformed into energy, which, as
already stated, has no effect upon the mercury of the thermometer.

QUESTION 40. _What is meant by the_ TOTAL HEAT _of steam?_

_Answer._ The “total heat of steam” is a phrase used to denote the
sum of the heat required to raise the temperature of water from some
given point up to the boiling-point due to a given pressure, and of the
heat which disappears in evaporating one pound of water under a given
pressure (or _latent heat of evaporation_.) Thus the latent heat of
one pound of steam at atmospheric pressure (14.7 lbs.) is 966.1 units;
and 212 units of heat are necessary to raise water from zero to the
boiling-point; therefore the total heat counted from zero of steam of
atmospheric pressure is 1,178.1 units. At 100 pounds absolute pressure
the latent heat is 885.5 and the sensible heat 327.9 degrees; therefore
the total heat measured from zero is 1,213.4 units.




PART IV.

THE SLIDE-VALVE.


QUESTION 41. _What are the essential conditions which a slide-valve
must fulfill in governing the admission and exhaust of steam to and
from the cylinder of an ordinary engine?_

_Answer._ 1. It must admit steam to one end only of the cylinders at
one time. 2. It must allow the steam to escape from one end at least
as soon as it is admitted to the other end; and 3. it must cover
the steam-ports so as not to permit the steam to escape from the
steam-chest into the exhaust-port.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 10._

Scale ³⁄₁₆ in. = 1 inch.]

QUESTION 42. _What was the first form of slide-valve used?_

_Answer._ That represented in fig. 10. The smallest movement of this
valve either way opens one of the steam-ports for the admission of
steam and puts the other in communication with the exhaust-port. By
cutting a piece of ordinary writing paper to the form of the section
of the valve, and moving it on the line _f f_, the action of the valve
will be clearly shown.

  _Scale, ³⁄₈ in. = 1 foot._]

QUESTION 43. _How was the admission and escape of the steam effected by
this valve?_

_Answer._ In order to explain this clearly, a series of diagrams
will be necessary. Before referring to them, however, it should be
explained first that the motion of an eccentric is exactly the same as
that of a small crank. It is in fact a crank with a crank-pin whose
diameter is very much enlarged. In the diagrams, figs. 11 to 25, the
eccentrics will therefore be represented as small cranks, and most
of the other parts by their centre-lines and points only, so as to
make the diagrams as simple as possible. The dimensions selected for
these illustrations are for the cylinder 16 in. diameter and 24 in.
stroke, and a connecting-rod 7 ft. long. The steam-ports are 1¹⁄₄ in.,
the exhaust-port 2¹⁄₂ in., and the metal or bars between them, which
are called _bridges_, are 1¹⁄₈ in. wide. The eccentric produces a
lateral movement of 3 in., which is called its _throw_. In fig. 11 the
piston is at the beginning of the backward stroke. The valve is then
in the centre of the valve-face, and the eccentric is consequently at
half-throw. The slightest movement of the crank in the direction of the
dart _N_ will move the eccentric enough to open the front steam-port
to the steam and the back one to the exhaust. In fig. 12 the piston
is represented as having moved 4 in. of its stroke; the valve has
then partly opened the front steam-port, and the other one is open to
the exhaust. In fig. 13 the piston has moved 8 in. of its stroke, and
the ports are now wide open, the front one to the steam and the back
one to the exhaust. In fig. 14 the piston has moved 12 in., or is at
half-stroke, and the valve has then moved as far as it will in that
direction. In fig. 15 the piston has moved 16 in. and the valve has
begun to return. In fig. 16 the piston has moved 20 in., and the valve
has nearly closed the front port to the steam and the other to the
exhaust. In fig. 17 the forward stroke is completed, and both ports
are closed by the valve. Figs. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 represent
the piston and the valve on the return stroke in the positions
corresponding with those described for the backward stroke.

QUESTION 44. _Is there any other method by which the motion of a valve
can be represented by a drawing?_

_Answer._ Yes, by what are called _motion-curves_. It is, however,
difficult to explain these clearly, and as they are purely imaginary,
it is difficult to understand their nature and purpose. Close attention
will therefore be required to the following description:

We will suppose, in the first place, that the line _f f_, fig.
25, represents the valve-face, _c_ and _d_ the steam and _g_ the
exhaust-port, drawn to a larger scale than in the preceding figures.
We will now draw the valve _H_ in the position represented in fig. 11,
where the piston is at the beginning of the stroke. In order to show
the valve in the position represented in fig. 12, where the piston has
moved 4 in. of the stroke, we will draw a line 4-20, four inches below
and parallel to _f f_, and extend the lines, representing the edges of
the ports _c_, _d_ and _g_, downward. On the horizontal line 4-20 we
will now draw the edges _i_, _r_, _i′_, _r_, of the valve in the same
position in relation to the port _c_ that it has in fig. 12. We will
then draw another horizontal line, 8-16, eight inches below _f f_,
and parallel to it, and on this represent the valve in the position
shown in fig. 13. In the same way we will draw lines 12, 16, 20 and
24 in. below _f f_, and draw the valve on each one respectively in
the positions shown in figs. 14, 15, 16 and 17. The distance between
the lower line 24-0, and _f f_, will then represent the stroke of the
piston, or 24 in. If now we begin from the edge _h_ of the valve on
the line _f f_, and draw a curve, _h i j k l m n_, through the same
edge of the valve, represented on each of the parallel lines below,
the curve will indicate the position of the valve in relation to the
steam-port _c_ at each point of the stroke. To illustrate this, suppose
we draw lines 1-23, 2-22, and 3-21, one inch apart and parallel to _f
f_, and between it and 4-20. They will then represent the position of
the piston after it has moved 1, 2 and 3 in. from the beginning of the
stroke, and where they intersect the curved line will be the position
of the edge of the valve when the piston has moved 1, 2 and 3 in. of
the stroke. The curved line will in fact represent the position of the
valve at any point of the stroke between these lines. Other horizontal
lines, 5-19, 6-18, etc., can be drawn to represent every inch of the
rest of the stroke. The curve line _h i j k l m n_, or _motion-curve_
as it is called, will then show the exact position of the edge of the
valve and of the width of the opening of the steam-port during the
whole stroke. From it we see that the valve opens the port _c_ for the
admission of steam simultaneously with the movement of the piston, and
when the latter has made one inch of its stroke the port _c_ is half
open. At 4¹⁄₂ inches of the stroke the port is wide open,[12] and at
19¹⁄₂ inches it begins to be closed, but is not completely closed until
the end of the stroke.

  [12] By cutting a paper section of the valve and placing it on the
  diagram in each position named, it will probably help the reader
  to understand the movement of the valve more and the nature of the
  motion-curves.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 25._

Scale ³⁄₁₆ in. = 1 inch.]

Similar motion-curves, such as _h′ i′ j′ k′ l′ m′ n′_, (represented
in fig. 25) can be drawn to represent the position of the other edges
of the valve, and also for the return stroke. The latter are shown in
dotted lines. If we follow the curve _h′ i′ j′ k′ l′ m′ n′_, which
represents the position of the edge of the valve _h′_ which governs the
exhaust from the back end of the cylinder, we see that the port _d_ is
opened and closed to the exhaust simultaneously with the opening and
closing of the port _c_ for the admission of steam to the front end of
the cylinder, and that they both remain open until the completion of
the stroke.

The width that the ports are opened by the valve is thus ascertainable
from these diagrams, for any point of the stroke, and in fact can be
seen at a glance. By the aid of such motion-curves, the movement of
slide-valves can therefore be analyzed more perfectly than is possible
without them.

QUESTION 45. _What were some of the disadvantages of valves, like that
shown in fig. 10, and which are shown by the motion-curves in fig. 25._

_Answer._ The free admission of the steam until the completion of the
stroke by the piston was hurtful to the machinery, as it co-operated
with the momentum of the piston and its connections in producing undue
strains in the working parts. The steam then escaped from the cylinder
without expansion, so that much of its useful energy was lost. The
steam was not allowed to escape from one end of the cylinder until it
was admitted at the opposite end, and as the process of exhausting it
occupies some time, there was always more or less back pressure until
all the exhaust steam was expelled from the cylinder. In practice,
the imperfections of the valve-gear frequently delayed the opening of
the ports, both for admitting and exhausting steam, until after the
commencement of the stroke of the piston.[13]

  [13] D. K. Clark’s “Railway Machinery.”

QUESTION 46. _How may some of these evils be overcome?_

_Answer._ By moving the eccentric forward on the axle so that the
motion of the valve is advanced to the same extent, and the admission
and exhaust of the steam will occur a little before the completion
of the stroke of the piston. In this way the steam is admitted into
the cylinder so as to act as a cushion to receive the momentum of the
piston, and some time is given to the exhaust steam to escape, before
the return stroke.

QUESTION 47. _What is meant by lead?_

_Answer._ By _lead_ is meant the width of the opening of the
steam-ports at the beginning of the stroke of the piston. On the steam
side of the valve it is called _outside lead_; on the exhaust side
_inside lead_. In fig. 26 the opening _h_ of the steam-port is the
outside lead and _h′_ the inside lead.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 26._

Scale ³⁄₁₆ in. = 1 inch.]

QUESTION 48. _What is meant by the travel of a valve?_

_Answer._ By the _travel_ we mean the motion of the valve back and
forth, or in other words its stroke. If the arms of the rocker are
of the same length, the travel of the valve is equal to the throw of
the eccentric. For the preceding illustrations we have selected an
eccentric with three inches throw, which is the travel of the valve.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 27._

Scale ³⁄₁₆ in. = 1 inch.]

QUESTION 49. _How is the steam made to work expansively with a
slide-valve?_

_Answer._ By giving the valve what is called _lap_. That is, by
allowing the edges of the valve when it is in the center of the
valve-seat to overlap the edges of the steam-ports, as shown in fig.
27. Where this overlap, _L L_, is on the outside of the valve, it is
called _outside lap_; when on the inside, _l l_, _inside lap_. When
a valve has lap, those portions of the _face_[14] _h_, _i_, and _h′_,
_q_, which cover the steam-ports, being wider than the ports, therefore
occupy some time in moving over them, during which time the steam is
enclosed in the end of the cylinder, as there is then no communication
either with the steam-chest or the exhaust-port. This action is shown
very clearly by the motion-curves in fig. 26. The valve in this case
has ¹⁄₄ inch lead. At 4¹⁄₂ inches of the stroke of the piston the valve
has moved as far as it will go in that direction, and the steam-port
has its maximum width of opening. From that point the valve will begin
to close the steam-port, and at 14¹⁄₂ inches of the stroke the port
will be entirely covered, and the steam therefore be _cut off_. The
port will remain closed until the piston has moved 21³⁄₄ inches, when
it will be observed from the motion-curve _r s t u v w x_, that the
port _c_ is opened to the exhaust and the steam escapes, or, as it is
technically called, the _release_ takes place. From the time the steam
is cut off to the time it is released, it works _expansively_ in the
cylinder.

  [14] The valve-face is the surface of the valve in contact with the
  valve-seat.

QUESTION 50. _What relation is there between the amount of lap_[15]
_and the degree of expansion?_

  [15] In speaking simply of _lap_, outside lap is always meant.

_Answer._ The greater the lap with any given travel, the shorter will
be the period of admission of steam, and, consequently, the more time
and space for expansion.

QUESTION 51. _What is the effect of inside lap?_

_Answer._ It delays the release of the steam. Thus in fig. 26 the valve
has ¹⁄₈ in. inside lap. The motion-curve _r s t u v w x_ shows that
the release takes place during the back stroke at 21³⁄₄ in. If now
there was no inside lap, the dotted line _y_, _x_ would represent the
exhaust edges of the valve, and the release would then occur somewhat
earlier, or at 21 in. For this reason no inside lap is usually given to
valves for engines which run at high rates of speed, as it allows too
little time for the steam to escape. In fact, in some cases, what is
called _inside clearance_ is given to the valve; that is, the valve as
shown in fig. 29, when it is in the middle of the valve-face, does not
entirely cover the steam-ports. The effect of this is just the reverse
of that produced by inside lap; that is, it causes the release to occur
earlier in the stroke.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 29._

Scale ³⁄₁₆ in. = 1 inch.]

QUESTION 52. _With the same outside lap, what is the effect of changing
the travel of the valve?_

_Answer._ By increasing the travel, the period of admission is
increased and that for expansion lessened; and by reducing it, the
admission is lessened, and the degree of expansion is increased. This
is shown by the motion-curves in fig. 28, in which the same valve and
ports are represented as are shown in fig. 26, but the valve has a
travel of 5 instead of 3 inches. The valve also has the same lead. By
following the motion-curve _h i j k l m n_, it will be seen that the
steam is thus admitted up to 20¹⁄₂ inches of the stroke of the piston,
and the period of expansion, as compared with that in fig. 26, is
correspondingly lessened. It will also be seen by comparing fig. 26
with fig. 28 that with the short travel of the valve the ports are not
opened so wide as they are when the travel is increased. This evil is
practically obviated, however, by making the ports so long that with
a comparatively small opening they will still have area sufficient
to admit enough steam to fill the cylinders, and it is known that an
opening less than the whole area of the steam-ports is sufficient to
facilitate the passage of steam into the cylinder.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 28._

Scale ³⁄₁₆ in. = 1 inch.]

QUESTION 53. _How is the exhaust affected by lap and lead?_

_Answer._ The steam is released earlier in the stroke in proportion as
the amount of outside lap and lead is increased, but the steam-port is
also closed to the exhaust, or _compression_, as it is called, begins
earlier with lap and lead than without. Thus, in fig. 25, it will
be seen that at the beginning of the stroke both ports are entirely
closed; in fig. 26, however, in which the valve has both lap and lead,
the port _d_ is nearly wide open at the beginning of the stroke, and
by following the motion-curve _r s t u v w x_, which represents the
position of the exhaust edge of the valve, it will be seen that the
steam was released from the port _c_ before the piston had completed
its stroke, or when it had still nearly 3¹⁄₂ inches to move. In fig. 25
the port _c_ is not opened to the exhaust until the commencement of the
stroke, but it remains open to its completion, whereas in fig. 26 it is
closed, or compression begins, at 18 inches of the return stroke, as
shown by the dotted motion-curve.

QUESTION 54. _How does the action of the connecting-rod influence the
motion of the valve in relation to the piston?_

_Answer._ By delaying the movement of the crank in the backward
stroke of the piston, and accelerating it in the forward stroke.
This will be best explained by reference to fig. 14, in which the
piston is represented in the center of the cylinder, or the middle
of the backward stroke. If now we take a pair of dividers set to a
length equal to that of the connecting-rod, and from the center, _f_,
describe an arc of a circle, _a b_, from the center of the shaft, and
through the lower half of the circle which represents the path of the
crank-pin, we will find that the point of intersection, _a_, falls
short of the vertical line, _c d_, and that the crank-pin has not made
quite one-quarter of a revolution while the piston was moving through
the first half of the backward stroke. By referring to fig. 21, in
which the piston is again in the middle of its stroke, but is moving
forward, and by describing another arc of a circle, _b a_, from the
center of the shaft and intersecting the path of the crank-pin, it will
be seen that the latter has moved _more_ than a quarter revolution,
while the piston has made the first half of the forward stroke.
Owing to this _angularity_, as it is called, of the connecting-rod,
the crank-pin is behind the piston during its backward stroke and
ahead of it during the forward stroke. As the valve is moved by the
eccentric, and it in turn by the shaft and crank, any irregularities
of the latter are of course communicated to the valve. We therefore
find, by referring to fig. 26, that the point of cut-off occurs during
the backward stroke at 14¹⁄₂ inches, and during the forward stroke
at 12 inches. A similar inequality is observable in the points of
release for the front and back strokes. It is not, however, a matter
of very great practical importance with stationary engines which run
at comparatively slow speeds; but if it is thought desirable, the
period of admission and the point of release for both strokes can be
equalized, either by giving the valve more lead or lap at one end
than the other, or by making the one steam-port wider than the other.
The mechanism employed for moving locomotive slide-valves, however,
furnishes us with the means of modifying their motion in relation to
that of the piston, and of thus equalizing the periods of admission and
release for the front and back strokes. The methods of doing this will
be more fully explained hereafter.




PART V.

THE EXPANSION OF STEAM.


[Illustration:

  _Fig. 30._

Scale ²⁄₃ in. = 1 foot.]

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 31._

Scale ¹⁄₄ in. = 1 inch.]

QUESTION 55. _How can we determine by experiment the pressure of the
steam in the cylinder at all points of the stroke?_

_Answer._ By the use of an instrument made for that purpose, called an
_indicator_. Its action can be best explained by supposing that we have
a small cylinder and piston, _T_, fig. 30, (shown on an enlarged scale
in fig. 31) attached by a pipe _U_ to one end of the cylinder _A_, so
that when steam is admitted to the latter it will be conducted to the
small cylinder _T_ through the pipe _U_. Over the small piston and
attached to it is a spiral spring, _s s_, fig. 31, which is compressed
when the piston rises and extended when it falls. To the top of the
piston-rod, _V_, a pencil, _W_, is attached. Behind this pencil we
will suppose there is a card, _a b c d_, and that this card is so
arranged that we can slide it horizontally and in contact with the
pencil point. With only the pressure of the atmosphere above and below
the piston _T_, the spring would be neither compressed nor extended,
and the piston would then stand in the position shown in fig. 31. If
now we move card horizontally, the pencil will draw a line, _g_, _h_,
called the _atmospheric line_. We will now suppose that the tension of
the spring is such that a pressure of 10 lbs. per square inch above or
below the piston will either extend or compress the spring ¹⁄₄ inch. In
other words, every pound of pressure per square inch in the piston will
move it ¹⁄₄₀ of an inch. If we could produce a vacuum under the piston,
it would be pressed down by the atmosphere above it ¹⁵⁄₄₀, or ³⁄₈ of
an inch. If, when it is thus depressed, we again slide the card along
in contact with the pencil-point, it will draw another line, _e_, _f_,
called the _vacuum-line_. Assuming that we have drawn these two lines,
and that the piston and card are in the position shown in figs. 30 and
31, we will then suppose that a reciprocating motion can be given to
the card by the lever _L_, _M_, _N_, fig. 30, which is pivoted at _M_
and attached at _N_ to the piston-rod by a short connecting-rod. It is
obvious that by connecting the upper end _L_ of the lever with a rod,
_L c_, to the card, the latter will be moved backwards and forwards
by the motion of the piston _B_, and that the motion of the card will
be simultaneous with that of the piston _B_, but of course of shorter
stroke. We will assume that the stroke of the card is equal to the
length of the atmospheric and vacuum lines _g h_ and _e f_, fig. 31.
If now, the piston being at the beginning of the stroke as shown in
fig. 30, we admit steam of 85 lbs. effective pressure per square inch
(which is equal to 100 lbs. absolute pressure) into the cylinder _A_,
it will be conveyed through the pipe _U_ to the cylinder _T_, and will
force up the piston ⁸⁵⁄₄₀ or 2¹⁄₈ inches above the atmospheric line, or
¹⁰⁰⁄₄₀ or 2¹⁄₂ inches above the vacuum line, as shown in fig. 32, and
the pencil will draw a vertical line, _g i_, on the card, (represented
by a dotted line in fig. 32.) We will suppose that steam is admitted
during 8 inches of the stroke, and is then cut off. When the piston
_B_, fig. 30, has moved that distance, which is one-third of its
stroke, the card will also have moved one-third of its stroke, and will
stand in relation to the pencil in the position represented in fig. 33,
and as the absolute steam pressure in the cylinder was maintained at
100 lbs. while the card was moving that distance, the pencil will have
drawn a horizontal line, _i j_. The steam is now cut off and begins to
expand, and its pressure is thereby reduced. When the piston of the
engine is at half-stroke, the card will also be at half-stroke, and
the steam will be expanded from 8 to 12 inches of the stroke. By the
rule given in the answer to question 20, its absolute pressure would
then be 66²⁄₃ lbs., and the indicator-piston will then be pressed down
by the spring, so that the pencil will stand in the position shown in
fig. 34, or 66²⁄₃ fortieths of an inch above the atmospheric line. The
pencil meanwhile will have drawn the curved line _j k_. When the piston
has moved 16 inches, the steam will be expanded to double its volume
and its absolute pressure will therefore be 50 lbs., and consequently
the pencil will stand 50 fortieths or 1¹⁄₄ inch above the atmospheric
line as shown in fig. 35, and the pencil will have continued the
curve _j k_ to _l_. At 20 inches the steam will have 40 lbs., and at
the completion of the stroke 33²⁄₃ lbs. absolute pressure, and the
pencil will have completed the curve _j k l m n_, as shown in figs.
36 and 37. This curve is called the _expansion curve_, and its form
is that which mathematicians call a hyperbolic curve. If the steam is
exhausted, the indicator-piston will descend and carry the pencil down
to the atmospheric line, and the vertical line _n h_, fig. 38, will
be drawn. On the return stroke, after the steam is exhausted from the
main cylinder _A_, fig. 30, the pencil would draw the atmospheric line
_g h_, fig. 38, thus showing that there is no steam pressure under
the piston. Such a diagram is called an _indicator diagram_.[16] In
practice there are a great many influences which modify it, such as
condensation, performance of work, imperfection of valve gear, etc.,
but for the present these are disregarded.

  [16] The indicator used in practice, to show the action of the
  steam in the cylinders of steam engines, differs essentially in
  its construction from that which we have described. The principles
  of operation are, however, the same in both. We will explain the
  construction of the Richard’s indicator, the one which is now most
  generally used, hereafter.

  _Fig. 38._

Scale ¹⁄₄ in. = 1 inch.]

QUESTION 56. _How can we ascertain the pressure of the steam for any
point of the stroke from such a diagram?_

_Answer._ By measuring the vertical distance by the expansion curve
(fig. 38) from the vacuum or the atmospheric line, as for example 8
_j_, 12 _k_, 16 _l_, 20 _m_. As the indicator spring is extended or
compressed one-fortieth of an inch[17] from every pound of pressure
per square inch, either above or below the indicator piston, if we
construct a scale _S_, _S_, fig. 38, with division of one-fortieth of
an inch each, one of them will represent one pound of pressure per
square inch if measured vertically from the atmospheric or vacuum
line. If we sub-divide the vacuum line with the same number of parts
as there are inches in the stroke of the piston (see fig. 39) we can
draw vertical lines from these points and thus determine the pressure
by comparing the length of such lines with the scale _S_, _S_. Thus
the line 8 _j_ measures 100 fortieths of an inch, thus showing that
the absolute steam pressure at 8 inches of the stroke was 100 lbs. per
square inch; the line 12 _k_ measures 66²⁄₃ fortieths of an inch, thus
showing that at 12 inches of the stroke the steam pressure was 66²⁄₃
lbs. At 16, 20 and 24 inches of the stroke the vertical lines measure
50, 40 and 33²⁄₃ fortieths; and therefore there were that number of
pounds of steam pressure when the piston was at the point of the stroke
named. Similar measurements could be made from other points, such as 2,
6, 10, or any other number of inches of the stroke. Of course, if we
measure from the vacuum line we will have the absolute steam pressure,
or the pressure _above a vacuum_, as it is sometimes called; if we
measure from the atmospheric line we will have the effective pressure,
or the _pressure above the atmosphere_.

  [17] Indicator springs are used of various degrees of tension, in
  proportion to the steam pressure to be indicated.

[Illustration: _Fig. 39._

Scale ¹⁄₄ in. = 1 inch.]

QUESTION 57. _How can we determine the average pressure during the
whole stroke of steam which works expansively?_

_Answer._ This can be determined approximately by the following method:
In the first place, divide the vacuum line (fig. 39) into any number
of equal divisions, say six. From the points of division, 4, 8, 12, 16
and 20, which in this case correspond with the points which represent
inches of the stroke, draw perpendicular lines, which will divide the
indicator diagram into six divisions. It is obvious that during the
time the steam is working full stroke the pressure is uniformly 100
lbs. absolute. While the piston is moving from 8 to 12 inches the
pressure falls from 100 to 66²⁄₃ lbs., so that at 10 inches we have
very nearly the average pressure during the period named. So from 12
to 16, 16 to 20 and 20 to 24 the average is nearly 57.1, 44.4 and
36.3 lbs., respectively. Now, BY ADDING TOGETHER THE PRESSURES IN THE
MIDDLE OF EACH ONE OF A NUMBER OF EQUAL DIVISIONS OF THE STROKE AND
DIVIDING BY THE NUMBER OF DIVISIONS, WE WILL OBTAIN APPROXIMATELY THE
AVERAGE ABSOLUTE PRESSURE DURING THE WHOLE STROKE. TO GET THE AVERAGE
EFFECTIVE PRESSURE, DEDUCT THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE FROM THE RESULT.
The calculation would in the above case be as follows:

    100   lbs.
    100    „
     80    „
     57.1
     44.4
     36.3
    -----
  6)417.8
    -----
     69.6 = Average absolute pressure.
     15
    -----
     54.6 = Average effective pressure.

A more accurate way of calculating the average or mean pressure, as it
is called, when steam is used expansively, and the one which is usually
employed, is to DIVIDE THE LENGTH OF THE PISTON’S STROKE IN INCHES
BY THE NUMBER OF INCHES AT WHICH THE STEAM IS CUT OFF: THE QUOTIENT
IS THE RATIO OF EXPANSION. GET THE HYPERBOLIC LOGARITHM OF THE RATIO
OF EXPANSION FROM THE TABLE OF LOGARITHMS IN THE APPENDIX, ADD 1 TO
IT, AND DIVIDE THE SUM BY THE RATIO OF EXPANSION AND MULTIPLY THE
QUOTIENT BY THE MEAN ABSOLUTE STEAM PRESSURE IN THE CYLINDER DURING ITS
ADMISSION. THE RESULT WILL BE THE MEAN ABSOLUTE PRESSURE DURING THE
STROKE. TO GET THE MEAN EFFECTIVE PRESSURE, DEDUCT THE ATMOSPHERIC
PRESSURE.

The calculation for the above example would be as follows:

  24
  -- = 3 = Ratio of expansion.
   8

  1.0986 + 1
  ---------- × 100 = 69.95 = Mean absolute pressure.
       3

  69.95 - 15 = 54.95 = Mean effective pressure.

The table of hyperbolic logarithms given in the appendix will be needed
in calculating the mean pressure of steam used expansively:

QUESTION 58. _What advantages result from using steam expansively?_

_Answer._ There is a very important saving in the amount of steam
required to do a given amount of work, and the strains and shocks which
are produced by the rapid motion of the piston and other reciprocating
and revolving parts of the engine are very much diminished by allowing
the steam to expand, and thus become reduced in pressure during the
latter part of the stroke.

QUESTION 59. _How is steam saved by using it expansively?_

_Answer._ Less steam is required when it is used expansively:

1. Because when steam of a high pressure is introduced into the
cylinder, and allowed to expand until its pressure is comparatively
low, it escapes at a lower pressure than the average pressure during
the whole stroke. If steam of a pressure equal to the _average_
pressure is worked full stroke, it would exert exactly the same force
on the piston as the steam of higher pressure did when working
expansively, but the pressure in the latter case, when the piston
reaches the end of the stroke, or the _final pressure_, as it is
called, would be considerably lower than in the other. The pressure of
steam represents _energy_, or _capacity for doing work_, and therefore
if we allow it to escape with a comparatively high pressure without
doing work, it is a waste of energy. To illustrate this, we will take
the same conditions which were used in the answer to Question 57,
in calculating the average pressure. In that case the mean absolute
pressure of the steam was 69.95 pounds per square inch, but the
pressure at the end of the stroke, when the steam escaped, was only
33²⁄₃ pounds absolute. If, therefore, steam had been used of the
average pressure through the whole stroke, it would have escaped with
a pressure of 69.95 pounds, or more than twice that of the expanded
steam, and the work done in both cases would have been the same.

2. There is also another incidental advantage in this, because
low-pressure steam can be exhausted more quickly from a cylinder than
steam of a high pressure, and consequently there is less resistance, or
_back pressure_, as it is called, in the exhausted end of the cylinder
to the movement of the piston.

3. The causes which produce the greatest economy when steam is used
expansively cannot be fully explained without discussing principles of
science more abstruse than it is desirable to introduce here. They can,
however, with the aid of the table of the “Properties of Steam,”[18] in
the appendix, be illustrated by a few simple calculations, so that the
economy of using steam expansively will be apparent.

  [18] This table is copied from Colburn’s Treatise on the Locomotive
  Engine.

For the basis of the calculations the same data and dimensions will
be employed that were used in the previous illustration; that is, a
cylinder of 16 in. diameter and piston with 24 in. stroke and steam
of 100 lbs. absolute pressure cut off at 8 in. of the stroke. We will
suppose, further, that the steam used is generated from water of a
temperature of 60 degrees, and we will then calculate the total number
of units of heat in the steam used for each stroke of the piston.
The area of a piston 16 in. in diameter is 201 square inches; and as
the steam is admitted until the piston moves 8 inches of its stroke,
therefore the quantity of steam would be 8 times 201 cubic inches, or

                             1608
  201 × 8 = 1608 cubic in. = ---- cubic ft.
                             1728

From the table it will be seen that one cubic foot of steam of 100 lbs.
pressure weighs .2307 lbs.; therefore the weight of the fraction of a
cubic foot given above would be calculated as follows:

  .2307 × 1608
  ------------ = .2146 lb. =
      1728

weight of 1608 cubic in. of steam of 100 lbs. absolute pressure.

From the table it will be seen that the total heat above zero of steam
of 100 lbs. absolute pressure is 1213.4 degrees. That is, as was
explained in answer to Question 40,[19] in order to boil water under
a pressure of 100 lbs. per square inch we must first heat water up to
327.9 degrees, and then, to convert it into steam, 885.5 degrees more
must be added. It was also explained in the answer to Question 35 that
one pound of water heated one degree is the standard of measurement or
_unit of heat_. Now if we have 1 lb. of water with a temperature of
zero, evidently it will take 1213.4 _units of heat_ to convert it into
steam of 100 lbs. absolute pressure. But as the water from which our
steam was generated had a temperature of 60 degrees, we must deduct
that much from 1213.4: 1213.4 - 60 = 1153.4 = units of heat in one
pound of steam of 100 lbs. absolute pressure generated from water of 60
degrees temperature.

  [19] In the illustration used in answer to Question 40, steam of 100
  lbs. _effective_ pressure was used, whereas in the above case it is
  _absolute_ pressure.

If now one pound of steam has 1153.4 units of heat, the following
calculation will give the units of heat in .2146 lbs.: 1153.4 × .2146 =
247.51 = units of heat in .2146 lbs., or 1608 cubic in. of steam of 100
lbs. absolute pressure.

It was shown in answer to Question 57 that the average pressure of
steam of 100 lbs. cut off at 8 in. of the stroke was 69.95 lbs. per
square inch. Disregarding the small fraction, we will call it 70 lbs.
Now if we admit steam of this pressure through the _whole stroke_ of
the piston, we will use 4,824 cubic inches. It will be found by a
calculation similar to the above, that to generate this quantity of
steam of 70 lbs. pressure from water of a temperature of 60 degrees
would require 527 units of heat, or more than twice as many as were
required to do the same work with steam of 100 lbs. pressure cut off
at 8 inches when using it expansively during the rest of the stroke.
The actual difference in practice is not so great as this, because the
loss of heat from radiation and condensation in the cylinder and other
causes is greater when steam of a high pressure is expanded than when
lower pressure steam is admitted through the whole stroke. But after
allowance is made for all such sources of loss and waste, there is
still an enormous gain from using steam expansively.

QUESTION 60. _What is meant by wire-drawn steam?_

_Answer._ It is the fall which the pressure of the steam undergoes
during its passage from the boiler to the cylinder,[20] and which is
due to the contracted opening of the steam pipes or valves.

  [20] Rankine.

QUESTION 61. _What is the economical effect of reducing the pressure,
or of wire-drawing it, by partly closing the valve by which it is
admitted to the cylinders?_

_Answer._ By reducing the pressure of steam in this or any other way,
it is necessary in doing the same amount of work to admit steam to the
cylinder for a longer period, and therefore to reduce the degree of
expansion. To illustrate the effect of this, we will estimate the total
heat required to exert a pressure of 70 lbs. on the piston described
above. It will be assumed that the steam pressure in the boiler is 100
lbs. absolute, and that this is wire-drawn down to 70 lbs. and admitted
to the cylinder through the whole stroke. As was shown in the preceding
answer, 4,824 cubic inches of steam are required to fill the cylinder.
Now 3,376.8 cubic inches of steam of 100 lbs. pressure, if expanded
to 70 lbs. pressure, will make 4,824 cubic inches. The total heat
required to generate 3,376.8 cubic inches of steam of 100 lbs. absolute
pressure from water of 60 degrees is 519.9 units, so that to do the
same work by using steam of _high pressure cut off at one-third of the
stroke_, using steam of _low boiler pressure full stroke_, and using
_wire-drawn steam full stroke_, would, in the example we have selected,
require 247.5, 527 and 519.9 units of heat respectively.

QUESTION 62. _To what extent can we work steam expansively, with
advantage and economy?_

_Answer._ The theoretical economy of using steam increases with the
degree of expansion and the pressure. This is shown very clearly in the
following table, in the first column of which the number of inches of
the piston stroke is given during which steam is admitted to a cylinder
16 in. in diameter and 24 in. stroke. In the second column is given the
pressure of the steam, or _initial pressure_, as it is called, which
must be admitted into the cylinder in order to produce a mean pressure
of 70 lbs. per square inch when it is cut off at the point indicated
in the first column. In the third column is given the total heat which
is required to generate the steam required in each case, and in the
last column the percentage of saving is given which results from the
different degrees of expansion and a mean pressure of 70 lbs. per
square inch in each case.

  +--------------------------------------+----------+---------+--------+

From this table it will be seen that theoretically 22¹⁄₂ per cent. of
heat is saved by cutting off at ³⁄₄ of the stroke and using steam of
72.5 lbs. pressure instead of steam of 70 lbs. worked full stroke.
Cutting off at half stroke and using steam of 82.7 lbs., 41¹⁄₄ per
cent. of heat is saved, and cutting off at quarter stroke with steam
of 117.4 lbs. saves 58 per cent. of heat; and at one-twelfth of the
stroke, or expanding steam of 241.4 lbs. pressure to twelve times its
volume, saves 72¹⁄₂ per cent. of heat.

As stated before, the above is the _theoretical_ advantage of using
steam expansively. There are, however, practical difficulties in
the way of using some of these high degrees of expansion. It has
already been explained that if steam is cut off early in the stroke
and the degree of expansion increased, the pressure and consequently
the temperature of the steam must also be increased. The danger of
explosion is greater with the higher pressures, and stronger and more
expensive boilers and machinery are therefore needed. With steam of
very high temperature the metal of the cylinders, pistons and valves
becomes so much heated that they soften, and then the friction of the
one on the other causes them to cut or scratch each other. The high
temperature at the same time destroys the oil or other lubricant used
in contact with the steam. It is also impossible to admit and cut off
steam very early in the stroke with the ordinary mechanical appliances
used for moving slide-valves of locomotives. This latter difficulty
will be more fully explained hereafter.




PART VI.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF A LOCOMOTIVE ENGINE.


QUESTION 63. _What are the principal parts of an ordinary locomotive
engine?_

_Answer._ A boiler for generating steam and a pair of high-pressure
steam engines, which are all mounted on a suitable frame and wheels
adapted for running on a track consisting of two iron or steel rails.

QUESTION 64. _How is the power of high-pressure engines applied to
locomotives?_

_Answer._ By connecting the engines with the wheels so as to give the
latter a rotary motion.

QUESTION 65. _When they revolve what will occur?_

_Answer._ Either they will slip on the track, or the locomotive will
move either backward or forward, according to the direction the wheels
are turning.

QUESTION 66. _What will determine whether the wheels will slip or the
locomotive move?_

_Answer._ The friction or _adhesion_, as it is called, between the
wheels and the track. If this adhesion is greater than the resistance
opposed to the movement of the locomotive, the latter will overcome the
resistance; but if the latter is greater than the friction, the wheels
will slip.

QUESTION 67. _Upon what does the amount of friction or adhesion of the
wheels depend?_

_Answer._ Chiefly on the weight which they bear, but to some extent
upon the condition of the rails. Under ordinary circumstances, the
adhesion of the wheels of a locomotive is in direct proportion to the
weight they carry.

QUESTION 68. _Why are two cylinders employed on locomotives?_

_Answer._ Because if only one was used, it would be impossible or very
difficult to start the engine, if it should stop on one of the dead
points.

QUESTION 69. _How is this difficulty overcome by the use of two
cylinders?_

_Answer._ By attaching the two cranks to the same shaft or axle, and
placing them at right angles to each other, so that when the one is at
a dead point the other is in the position where the steam can exert the
maximum power on the crank.

QUESTION 70. _How are the cranks of an ordinary locomotive made?_

_Answer._ They are cast in one piece with the wheels that drive the
locomotive, which are therefore called _driving-wheels_. In this
country the centre portion of such wheels, or _wheel-centres_ as
they are called, is always made of cast iron, with tires of wrought
iron or steel around the outside, and is fastened to the axles of
the locomotive. The shaft of a locomotive engine is called the _main
driving-axle_, and the wheels attached to it the _main driving-wheels_.

QUESTION 71. _How are the cylinders and driving-wheels of a locomotive
usually placed?_

_Answer._ The cylinders _A_, plates I, II and III, are placed at the
front end of the locomotive, and the main driving-axle, _B_, far enough
behind them to permit the connecting rods, _C_, to be attached to
pins, _D_, in the cranks, called _crank-pins_. In this country these
cranks are now universally placed on the outside of the wheels, and
therefore the cylinders must be placed far enough apart (as shown in
fig. 40 and Plate III) to permit the connecting-rods to be attached to
the crank-pins. The cylinders are therefore placed outside the frames,
_H_, _H_, Plate III, (the latter are inside of the wheels,) and are
now nearly always horizontal, although in old engines they are often
inclined. Plate I is a side view of an ordinary eight-wheeled American
locomotive, Plate II a longitudinal section, Plate III a plan, and fig.
40, a transverse section through the cylinder and smoke-box.

[Illustration: _Fig. 40._

Scale ¹⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 72. _What are the smaller wheels, E E, called, and what are
they for?_

_Answer._ They are called _truck-wheels_ and carry the weight of the
cylinders and other parts of the front end of the locomotive, and serve
to guide and steady the machine in a manner which will be more fully
explained hereafter.

QUESTION 73. _Why are more than one pair of driving wheels necessary
for locomotives?_

_Answer._ Because if all the weight which is needed to create the
requisite adhesion of the wheels of locomotives to pull heavy loads was
placed on one pair of wheels, it would be so excessive as to partly
crush and injure the rails. It is therefore distributed, usually on two
pairs, but sometimes on three or four or even more pairs.

QUESTION 74. _Where is the second pair of driving-wheels usually
placed?_

_Answer._ These wheels, _F_--called the _back_ or _trailing
driving-wheels_--are, in the ordinary type of locomotives used in this
country, situated behind the main driving-wheels, far enough back to
give the room necessary for the boiler, _G_, between the two axles, as
shown in plates I, II and III.

QUESTION 75. _How are the axles, cylinders, etc., held in the right
position in relation to each other?_

_Answer._ By longitudinal frames, _H_, _H_, _H_, _H_, which hold the
axles in the proper position, and are bolted to the cylinders, and also
fastened to the boiler at _I_, _I_, Plate I.

QUESTION 76. _How is a locomotive engine made to run either backward or
forward?_

_Answer._ By having two eccentrics, _J_, _J_, Plate III (also shown
in Plate II,) for each cylinder. One of these is fixed or _set_ on
the shaft in such a position as to move the valve so that the engine
will run in one direction; the other eccentric is set so that the
engine will run the reverse way. The ends of the two eccentric rods
are attached to what is called a _link_, _L_, (Plates II and III,)
the object of which is to furnish the means of quickly engaging and
disengaging either eccentric rod to or from the rocker, _K_. The link
is operated by a system of levers, consisting of the lifting shaft,
_M_, and arms, _N_, _N_, and the reverse lever, _O_, _O_, (Plate II).
The principles and working of these will be more fully explained
hereafter.

QUESTION 77. _What are the principal parts or “organs” of a locomotive
boiler?_

_Answer._ 1. A fire-place, or, as it is called a _fire-box_, _G_,
(Plate II,) which is surrounded with water.

2. A cylindrical part, _P P_, (Plates I and II,) attached to the
fire-box at one end and to a chamber, _Q_, called the _smoke-box_, at
the other.

3. The tubes or flues _a a′_, (Plate II and fig. 40,) which connect the
fire-box with the smoke-box and pass through the cylindrical part of
the boiler and are surrounded with water.

4. The smoke-stack or chimney _R R_.

QUESTION 78. _What is each of these parts or organs for and of what do
they consist?_

_Answer._ The fire-box _G_ furnishes the room for burning the fuel,
and consists of an inner and outer shell made of boiler plate, with
the space between the two filled with water; a grate, _b b_, (Plate
II,) formed of cast-iron bars, with spaces between them for admitting
air for the combustion of the fuel, which is placed on the top of
them; a door, _C_, called the _furnace-door_, for supplying the grate
with fuel; a receptacle, _d d_, below the grate, to collect ashes,
and therefore called the _ash-pan_, which is supplied with suitable
dampers, _n′_, _n′_, for admitting or excluding the air from the fire.

The cylindrical part _P P_, or _waist_ of the boiler as it is sometimes
called, contains the greater part of the water to be heated.

The flues or tubes, as they are generally called, of which a locomotive
has from one to two hundred, are usually two inches in diameter,
and about eleven feet long. They conduct the smoke and products of
combustion from the fire-box to the smoke-box. These tubes are made of
small diameter so as to sub-divide the smoke into many small streams
and thus expose it to a large radiating surface through which the heat
is conducted to the water.

The smoke-stack serves partly for removing into the open air the smoke
which passes through the flues, and partly for producing a strong draft
of air, which is indispensably necessary for the rapid combustion of
the fuel, and also for collecting and extinguishing the sparks from the
fire.

QUESTION 79. _How is the draft produced in locomotive boilers?_

_Answer._ By conducting the exhaust steam through pipes (_e_, _e_,
fig. 40) from the cylinders to the smoke-box and allowing it to escape
up the smoke-stack from apertures, _f_, _f_, (Plate II, fig. 40.)
called _exhaust nozzles_. The strong current of steam thus produced in
the smoke-stack produces a vacuum, by which the smoke is sucked into
the smoke-box with great power and forced out of the smoke-stack into
the open air.

QUESTION 80. _How are the water and fuel carried which must be supplied
to a locomotive while it is running?_

_Answer._ The water is carried in a tank, which is constructed in the
form of the letter ~U~, so as to give room for the stowage of fuel
between its two branches or sides. This tank is carried on a set of
wheels, and forms a separate vehicle, independent of the locomotive,
called a _tender_, the construction of which will be explained in a
future chapter.

QUESTION 81. _What are the dimensions of the principal parts of a
locomotive?_

_Answer._ There is a great variety in the plan, size and capacity
of locomotives, but the type which is more generally used in this
country than any other, and which has been selected for the preceding
illustrations, and will be described in the succeeding chapters of
the Catechism, has four driving and four truck wheels, and weighs in
working condition about 60,000 lbs. The following are the dimensions
of its principal parts: The driving-wheels are about 5 feet and the
truck-wheels from 26 to 30 inches in diameter. The longitudinal
distance between the centres of the driving-wheels is usually about
7 feet, and between the centres of the truck-wheels 5 ft. 9 in., and
the total distance from the centre of the back driving-wheels to the
centre of the front truck-wheels, which is called the _wheel-base_, is
21 ft. 8 in. The weight on each driving-wheel is usually about 10,000
lbs., and on each truck-wheel about 5,000 lbs. The cylinders are 16 in.
in diameter and the piston has 24 in. stroke, and the connecting-rod
is 7 ft. long measured between the centres of the pins to which it is
attached. The centres of the cylinders are about 6 feet apart, measured
across the track. The fire-box inside is 5 feet long and 2 ft. 11 in.
wide, and the cylindrical part of the boiler is 4 feet in diameter
measured on the outside of the smallest portion. The water spaces
around the fire-box are about 3 inches wide. There are 140 tubes, which
are 2 in. in diameter measured on their outside, and 11 ft. long. The
inside of the smoke-stack is 16 in. in diameter, and it is 14 ft. 3 in.
high measured from the top of the rails. The tender carries about 1,800
gallons of water and about 8,000 lbs. of coal. When loaded it weighs
about 40,000 lbs., making the total weight of the engine and tender
100,000 lbs.

PART VII.

THE LOCOMOTIVE BOILER.


QUESTION 82. _How does the quantity of steam generated in locomotive
boilers in a given time compare with that generated in the boilers of
stationary and marine engines?_

_Answer_. Locomotive engine boilers must produce much more steam in
a given time, in proportion to their size, than is required of the
boilers of any other class of engines, (excepting perhaps those of
steam fire-engines,) because the space which locomotive boilers can
occupy and also their weight is limited.

QUESTION 83. _How is their steam-generating capacity increased above
that of marine and stationary boilers?_

_Answer_. By creating a very strong draft of air through the fire and
then passing the smoke and heated air through a great many small tubes,
which are surrounded by water. By this means the smoke and hot air are
divided into many small streams or currents which are exposed to the
inside surface of the tubes to which and to the surrounding water their
heat is imparted.

QUESTION 84. _How is the action of the exhaust steam in producing a
draft in the chimney explained?_

_Answer_. The exhaust steam escapes from the cylinders through one or
two contracted openings or exhaust-nozzles (_f_, Plate II, also shown
in fig. 40[21]), which point directly up the centre of the chimney or
smoke-stack. The exhaust steam escapes from this orifice with great
velocity, and expands as it rises, so that it fills the pipe _p_ and
the smoke-stack _R R_. It thus acts somewhat like a plunger or piston
forced violently up the chimney, and pushes up the air above it, and,
owing to the friction of the particles of air, carries that which
surrounds it along up the stack, from which it all escapes finally into
the open air, thus leaving a partial vacuum behind in the smoke-box.
The external pressure of the atmosphere then forces in air through any
and every opening in the smoke-box, to take the place of that already
drawn out or exhausted from it. As the only inlet is through the tubes,
to which the gases of combustion have free access from the fire-box,
and as the external air can only pass through the fire-grate, and
through the burning fuel, to reach the fire-box, there is a constant
draft of air through the grate as long as the waste steam escapes from
the blast-pipe and up the chimney. It is thus that, within certain
limits, the more the steam that is required, the more the steam that is
produced; for all the steam used in the engine draws in the air in its
final escape, to excite the fire to generate more steam.[22] Sometimes
one blast-orifice is used for each cylinder, as shown in plates II and
III and fig. 40; in other cases the exhaust steam from each cylinder
escapes through the same orifice.

  [21] The term _blast-orifice_ is also often used to designate these
  parts of locomotives.

  [22] Colburn’s Locomotive Engineering.

QUESTION 85. _How much water is it necessary to evaporate in order
to furnish the steam required to run an ordinary train at its usual
speed?_

_Answer._ For an ordinary “American” locomotive,[23] weighing 60,000
lbs. and with cylinders of 16 inches diameter and 24 inches stroke,
from 6,000 to 12,000 lbs. of water must be evaporated per hour.

  [23] In speaking of “American” locomotives, we mean locomotives like
  that shown in Plate I, with four driving-wheels and a four-wheeled
  truck, and shall so use the term hereafter.

QUESTION 86. _How much water will a pound of coal evaporate in ordinary
practice?_

_Answer._ The quantity of water which is converted into steam by a
pound of coal varies very materially with the quality of the coal, and
the construction and condition of the boiler; but from 6 to 8 lbs. of
water per pound of coal is about the average performance of ordinary
locomotives. It is, therefore, necessary to burn from 500 to 2,000 lbs.
of coal per hour in order to generate the quantity of steam required by
ordinary engines.

QUESTION 87. _How large a grate is needed to burn this quantity of
coal?_

_Answer._ The maximum rate of combustion may be taken at about 125 lbs.
of coal on each square foot of grate surface per hour, so that to burn
2,000 lbs. we need a grate with about 16 square feet of surface.

QUESTION 88. _How much heating surface is needed for a given size of
grate?_

_Answer._ In common practice about 50 square feet of heating surface
are given for each square foot of grate. There are, however, no reasons
for the proportions of either grate or heating surface which are given,
excepting that it has been found that they work well in practice. It
is, however, quite certain that the larger a boiler is, and the greater
its heating surface in proportion to the steam it must generate, other
things being equal, the more economical will it be in its consumption
of fuel, or, in other words, the more water will it evaporate per pound
of coal.

QUESTION 89. _Why is it necessary to use small tubes or flues in order
to have the required amount of heating surface?_

_Answer_. Because there is a great deal more surface in a small tube
of a given length, in proportion to the space it occupies, than in a
large one. Thus a tube _two_ inches in diameter and eleven feet long
has 829 square inches of surface, and one _four_ inches in diameter has
1,658 square inches, or just double the quantity. But the four-inch
tube occupies _four times_ as much space as the other, as it is twice
as high and twice as wide. Therefore, in proportion to the space it
occupies, the tube which is two inches in diameter has twice as much
surface as the larger one. If we compare a two-inch with an eight-inch
tube, we will find that the former has _four_ times as much surface,
in proportion to its size, as the eight-inch tube. As the size and
weight of locomotive boilers are limited, it is therefore necessary, in
order to get the requisite heating surface in the space to which we are
confined, to use tubes of small diameter.

Small tubes also have the advantage that they may be made of thinner
material, and yet have the same strength to resist a bursting pressure
from within, or a collapsing pressure from without, as larger tubes
made of thicker metal. The advantage of thin tubes is, that the heat
inside of them is conducted to the water outside more rapidly than it
would be through thicker metal, which is important when combustion is
as rapid as it is in locomotive boilers.

The reason tubes of smaller diameter than two inches are not ordinarily
used is because they are then liable to become stopped up with cinders
and pieces of unconsumed fuel.

QUESTION 90. _How is the fire-box of a locomotive constructed?_

_Answer._ It usually consists of a rectangular box (_G_, figs. 41 and
42) about three feet wide[24] and, for the size of engine we have
selected as an example, about five or five and a half feet long inside.
This box is composed of metal plates, either iron, steel or copper,
which, excepting on the front side, are from ⁵⁄₁₆ to ³⁄₈ of an inch
thick. This box is called the _inside shell_ of the fire-box, and is
surrounded by another shell, _A B C D E F_, fig. 42, of either iron
or steel plates, of about the same thickness as those composing the
inside. This is called the _outside shell_ of the fire-box and, as
already explained, is so much larger than the inside that there is a
space, called the _water-space_, from 2¹⁄₂ to 4¹⁄₂ inches wide, on all
the sides of the fire-box between the inner and outer plates.

  [24] The width is dependent upon the distance between the rails, or
  _gauge_ of the road, as it is called. The above size is for a 4 feet
  8¹⁄₂ in. gauge.

The top _g_, _g_, of the inside shell, which is called the
_crown-sheet_ or _crown-plate_, is flat, whereas the outside shell is
arched, as shown in fig. 42. To the front plate of the inside shell the
tubes _a a′_, _a a′_ are attached. For this reason its thickness is
usually made greater than that of the other plates, and is usually from
³⁄₈ to ³⁄₄ of an inch. The edges of one of the plates at each corner
of the fire-box, where they are united together, as shown in figs. 41
and 42, are bent at right angles, and the other is fastened to it with
rivets from ⁵⁄₈ to ³⁄₄ of an inch in diameter.

The inside and the outside shells of the fire-box are united to each
other by a wrought-iron bar or _ring_ (_A F_, figs. 41 and 42) which
completely surrounds the inner shell and closes the water-space between
the two shells. This bar is bent and welded to the proper form to
extend around the bottom of the inside fire-box, and it is riveted to
both shells. The water in the water-space is in free communication
with the rest of the water in the boiler; and thus the flat sides of
the respective shells of the fire-box are exposed to the full pressure
of the steam, which tends to burst the outside shell and collapse the
inside one. These flat sides, by themselves, would be unable to resist
the strain upon them, but as the strain upon the respective fire-boxes
is in opposite directions, and necessarily equal for equal areas of
surface, tie-bolts, _n_, _n_, _n_, _n_, (figs. 41 and 42,) or, as they
are called _stay-bolts_, which are from ³⁄₄ to 1 inch in diameter,
are screwed through the plates at frequent intervals, usually from
3¹⁄₂ to 4¹⁄₂ in. apart, so as to connect the two fire-boxes securely
together, the ends of the stay-bolts being also riveted or spread out
by hammering so as still further to increase their holding power. These
bolts, owing to the expansion and contraction of the boiler and other
strains to which they are subjected, very frequently break, and if they
are made of solid bars of metal there is no way of discovering with
certainty whether they are in good condition or not without taking the
boiler to pieces. They should therefore be made of the best quality of
wrought iron, brass or copper and should also be made tubular, that is
they should have a hole through the centre, so that when they break the
water will escape at the fracture into the hole and the leak will thus
indicate the defect and danger. The latter is much greater from this
cause than is usually supposed, and it is not unusual to find on taking
a boiler to pieces that a large number of the stay-bolts are broken.

[Illustration: _Fig. 41._

Scale ¹⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

[Illustration: _Fig. 42._

Scale ¹⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 91. _How can the strain on the flat surface of a boiler
between the stay-bolts be calculated?_

_Answer_. By MULTIPLYING THE AREA IN INCHES BETWEEN ADJACENT
STAY-BOLTS BY THE PRESSURE. The reason for this is, that each stay-bolt
must sustain the pressure on a part of the plate to which it is
attached. Thus in fig. 43 it is plain that the bolt _s_ must sustain
the pressure on one-half of that part of the plate between it and the
bolts _v_, _t_, _w_, _u_, around it, or the pressure on the square _a
b d c_, whose sides are equal to the distance (4 inches) between the
centres of the bolts. With a pressure of 100 pounds per square inch,
the calculation would therefore be: 4 × 4 × 100 = 1,600 lbs. on each
bolt.

[Illustration: Fig. 43. Scale 1¹⁄₂ in. = 1 foot.]

Stay-bolts should never be subjected to a strain of more than
one-eighth or one-tenth of their breaking strength.

QUESTION 92. _How do stay-bolts often fail without breaking?_

_Answer._ By tearing or _stripping_ the thread of the bolt, or that
in the plate, but oftener perhaps by the stretching of the plates
between the holes. With a heavy pressure, the tendency of the plates
between the holes, especially if they are heated very hot, is to
“bulge” outward and thus stretch the hole in every direction until
it is so large that the bolt is drawn out without much injury to the
screw-thread.

QUESTION 93. _How is the flat-top or crown-sheet strengthened?_

_Answer._ It is sometimes strengthened with stay-bolts similar to those
used for the sides, which pass through the inner and outer shells;[25]
but usually the crown-sheet is strengthened by a series of iron bars,
(_f_, _f_, fig. 41 and 42) called _crown-bars_, placed on edge, and of
considerable depth, which are firmly fastened to it by T-head rivets
or bolts. The crown-sheet can therefore only be crushed downwards by
bending these bars, which are of great strength. They usually extend
crosswise of the length of the fire-box, but are sometimes placed
lengthwise. These bars bear on the fire-box only at each end, as shown
in fig. 42, and are usually made with a projection, _k_, _k_, which
rests on the edge of the side plates. Iron rings or washers from ³⁄₄ to
1¹⁄₂ inches thick are interposed between the plate and the bars at the
points where the bolts or rivets which secure the rivets pass through.
This permits the water to circulate under the bars, and prevents the
crown-sheet from being burnt or overheated, as it would be if the
water were excluded from the whole under surface of the crown-bars.
[26]The crown-bars are also attached to the outer shell and the dome by
_braces_, _e_, _e_, _l_, _l_.

  [25] This method of staying crown-sheets has been extensively used on
  the Baltimore & Ohio and Reading railroads, and is now very generally
  used in Europe.

  [26] Colburn’s Locomotive Engineering.

The opening _c_, fig. 41, at the back end is for the door through which
fuel is supplied to the grate.

QUESTION 94. _How are the grates constructed?_

_Answer._ They are generally made of cast-iron bars, and for burning
coal are usually arranged so that the fire can be shaken by moving
the bars. For burning anthracite coal, the grates are sometimes made
of wrought-iron tubes, through which a current of water circulates to
prevent them from being overheated.

QUESTION 95. _How are cinders and burning coals prevented from falling
through the grate upon the road?_

_Answer._ By attaching a sheet-iron receptacle or ash-pan (_d′ d′_,
fig. 41) as it is called, under the grate, which it completely encloses
from the outside air. This then serves two purposes, as it is often
important when the engine is standing still to prevent any access of
air to the fire-box, and therefore the ash-pan is made to fit tightly
to the fire-box. Suitable doors, or _dampers_ as they are called, are
placed in front and behind, and sometimes on the sides, which can be
opened or closed to admit or exclude air as may be needed.

QUESTION 96. _How are the tubes or flues of a locomotive arranged?_

_Answer._ They are fastened into accurately drilled holes in the tube
sheet (_a_, _a_, figs. 41 and 42) which forms the front of the fire-box
and in similar holes in a plate (_a′_, _a′_, fig. 41,) which forms the
front end of the cylindrical part of the boiler. They thus connect
the fire-box with the smoke-box. The tubes are arranged so that each
tube will have a space of from ⁵⁄₈ to ⁷⁄₈ of an inch between it and
those adjoining. The position of the holes for the tubes in relation
to each other is determined by describing from the centre of one tube
(_o_, fig. 44) a circle with a radius, _o k_, equal to the sum of
the diameter of a tube and the distance which they are intended to
be apart, and then subdividing this circle with the radius into six
parts, _k_, _r_, _s_, _l_, _g_ and _p_. Each point of subdivision and
also the centre, _o_, of the circle will be the centre of a tube. By
drawing them from these centres it will be found that the distances
_a b_, _c d_ between adjoining tubes will be the same between all of
them. By describing circles from the centres of the outside tubes and
subdividing the circles as before the position of other tubes will
be determined around those first laid down. This can, of course, be
carried out indefinitely. A difference in the arrangement of the tubes
will be observed if, when we subdivide the first circle shown in fig.
44, instead of commencing from the intersection of a vertical line we
begin from a horizontal line, _h i_, as shown in fig. 45. In the former
case the tubes are said to be in _vertical rows_, and in the latter in
_horizontal rows_. It is apparent from the figures and as shown by the
arrows that the water can circulate in ascending currents more freely
when tubes are arranged in vertical rows than when they are arranged
horizontally.

[Illustration: Fig. 44. Scale ¹⁄₄.]

[Illustration: Fig. 45. Scale ¹⁄₄.]

QUESTION 97. _How are the tubes fastened and made water-tight in the
tube-sheets?_

[Illustration: Fig. 46. Scale ¹⁄₄.]

[Illustration: Fig. 47.]

_Answer._ They are inserted into the holes drilled to receive them, and
the ends are allowed to project about a quarter of an inch beyond the
tube-sheets. A tapered plug, fig. 46, is then driven into the tube,
to expand it so that it will fit the hole. A tool is used called a
_tube-expander_, fig. 47, which is what might be called an expanding
plug, consisting of a number of sections, _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_,
_g_, _h_, held together by a spring clasp _s_, which embraces them, as
shown in the engraving. This plug when the sections are drawn together
is inserted into the mouth of the tube, and the tapered plug _p p_,
is then driven into the opening left in the center of the cluster of
sections, which are thus expanded. By this means, the ridge _a b c
d_ expands the tube at the inner edge of the tube-sheet, forming a
ridge or corrugation, as shown at _c c_, fig. 48. At the same time
the shoulder _j k l_ on the tool expands the outer edge of the tube
somewhat as is shown at _f f_, fig. 48. By repeating this process,
and slightly turning the expander each time, the tubes can be made
perfectly water-tight. There are other forms of tube-expanders, but the
one described, known as Prosser’s expander, is more generally used than
any other. In many cases, after the tubes are expanded with the tool
described, the outer edge is turned over still more with what is called
a _thumb-tool_, fig. 49, probably from its resemblance in form to a
man’s thumb. By placing the curved shoulder _a_ on the end _f_, fig.
48, of the tube it is turned over, somewhat in the form shown in the
engraving, by repeated blows of a hammer on the end of the tool. Copper
ferrules, represented by the black shading, _a a_, are also much used
now on the outside of locomotive tubes, and it is said that with them
the joints can be kept tight much easier than without. By turning over
the outside edge of the tube as shown in fig. 48, it not only protects
the copper ferrule, but, as the tubes must act as braces to sustain
the pressure of steam in the flat tube-sheets, it gives the joints the
requisite strength for resisting such strains.

[Illustration: Fig. 48. Scale ¹⁄₄.]

[Illustration: Fig. 49.]

QUESTION 98. _How can the strain on the cylindrical part of a boiler be
calculated?_

_Answer._ BY MULTIPLYING THE DIAMETER IN INCHES BY THE LENGTH IN INCHES
AND THE PRODUCT BY THE STEAM-PRESSURE PER SQUARE INCH. Thus for a
boiler 48 inches in diameter and 10 feet long with 100 pounds pressure
the calculation would be 48 × 120 × 100 = 576,000 lbs.

QUESTION 99. _Why do we multiply the diameter, instead of the
circumference, by the length, to get the strain on the cylindrical
part?_

_Answer._ The reason for multiplying by the diameter instead of by the
circumference is because only a portion of the pressure on the inside
surface of the boiler exerts a force to burst the shell at any one
point. Thus, supposing the following diagram, fig. 50, to represent
a section of a boiler, if we have a force acting on the shell in the
direction of the line _a b_, at the point _b_, where it is exerted
against the shell of the boiler, it would be composed of two forces,
one acting in the direction _b e_, and tending to tear the boiler
apart on the line _c d_, and the other acting in the direction _f b_,
to tear it apart on the line _h g_. It is so with all pressure inside
the boiler, excepting that, say _a h_, which acts exactly at right
angles to the line of rupture _c d_, it is all composed of two forces,
only one of which tends to tear the boiler apart at one point. It is
therefore only a part of the pressure on the circumference which tends
to burst the boiler at a given place, and that part is equivalent to
the pressure on a surface whose width is equal to the diameter and not
the circumference.

[Illustration: Fig. 50.]

[Illustration: Fig. 51.]

This we know is a little difficult for those to understand who are
not familiar with the principles of what is called the “resolution of
forces,” and we will therefore try to make it clear in another way.

To do this we will suppose that we have a boiler, _a b_, fig. 51,
made in two halves and bolted together at _a_ and _b_ by flanges. It
is evident that if we brought a pressure against the inside of the
flanges in the direction of the darts _c_ and _d_, such a pressure
would not have a tendency to tear apart the bolts _a_ and _b_. Some
distortion of the boiler might in fact take place, if, for example,
we put a jack-screw inside and forced out the flanges as indicated,
without subjecting the bolts to a tensile strain. We see therefore that
the forces acting in the direction _c_ and _d_ have no tendency to tear
apart the bolts at _a_ and _b_, but it is only the forces such as _e_,
_f_ and _g_, which act at right angles to _a b_, that exert a strain on
the flanges.

That this force is equivalent to a pressure on a surface with a width
equal to the diameter of the boiler is apparent if we suppose that we
have a boiler, _a b_, fig. 52, and that each half, _c_ and _d_, is
nearly filled with some substance, say wood or cement, which is fitted
so tight that no steam can get between it and the shell of the boiler.
It is apparent now that if we admit steam into the space _f_, the force
exerted on the bolts _a_ and _b_ is that due to the pressure on the
surface of the wood or cement exposed to the steam whose width is
equal to the diameter of the boiler. It might be said though that if
this substance were elastic, like india-rubber, the effect of the steam
would be different. If it were elastic, and a pressure on the surfaces
_f_ caused it to spread in the direction _g_ and _h_ so as to produce
a pressure in those directions, it would, as has already been shown,
not exert a force on the bolts _a_ and _b_ to tear them apart, but have
a tendency to rupture the boiler at right angles to _a b_. The sides
of the boiler must therefore have a strength sufficient to resist this
force which tends to tear them asunder. If the boiler is made of iron
³⁄₈ inch thick there would be a sectional area of 45 square inches on
each side, or a total of 90 square inches, to resist this strain, so
that each square inch must bear 6,400 lbs. of strain. The correctness
of this rule can be demonstrated by the use of mathematics, which would
be out of place here. Its practical truth has however been proved by
experiment.

[Illustration: Fig. 52.]

QUESTION 100. _How much strain per square inch is good boiler plate
capable of resisting, and how much is it safe to subject it to?_

_Answer._ There is great variation in the tensile strength[27] of
rolled iron boiler plate, but that of good plate will average about
50,000 pounds per square inch, if the strain is applied in the
direction of the “grain” or the fibres of the iron[28], and about ten
per cent. less if the strain is applied crosswise of the grain. It
has, however, been found by experiment that when a tensile strain is
applied to a bar of iron or other material, it is stretched a certain
amount in proportion to the length of the bar and to the degree of
strain to which it is subjected. It is found that if this strain does
not exceed about one-fifth of that which would break the bar, it will
recover its original length, or will contract after being stretched,
when the strain is removed. The greatest strain which any material
will bear without being permanently stretched is called its _limit
of elasticity_, and so long as this is not exceeded no appreciable
permanent elongation or “set” will be given to iron by any number
of applications of such strains or loads. If, however, the limit of
elasticity is exceeded, the metal will be permanently elongated, and
this elongation will be increased by repeated applications of the
strain until finally the bar will break. At the same time the character
of the metal will be altered by the repeated application of strains
greater than its elastic limit, and it will become brittle and less
able to resist a sudden strain, and will ultimately break short off.
It is therefore unsafe to subject iron, or in fact any other material,
to strains greater than its elastic limit. This limit for iron boiler
plates may be taken at about one-fifth its breaking, or, as it is
called, _ultimate_ strength. It should be remembered, however, in
this connection, that it often happens that the steam pressure is not
the greatest force the boiler must withstand, as sudden or unequal
expansion and contraction are probably more destructive, to locomotive
boilers especially, than the pressure of the steam.

  [27] A force exerted to pull any material apart is called a _tensile
  strain_, and if exerted to compress it is called a _compressive
  strain_.

  [28] It should be explained that in the process of manufacturing iron
  by rolling, the iron is stretched out into fibres in the direction in
  which it passes between the rolls.

QUESTION 101. _How are the plates of boilers fastened together?_

_Answer._ With rivets, which are made with a head at one end, and are
inserted while they are red-hot into holes drilled or punched in the
edges of the plates. After they are in the holes a head is formed on
the other end, either with blows from hand hammers, or by a machine
constructed for the purpose. In these machines the rivet after it is
in the holes is brought between a fixed and a movable die, the head
which is made with the rivet being placed against the fixed die, and
the movable die is then pressed, either by steam or hydraulic pressure
with great force against the other end of the rivet, thus forcing the
end of the rivet into the form of the die, which is made of the proper
shape and size for the rivet head. The powerful pressure which is thus
brought on the rivet causes it to be pressed into all parts of the two
holes, thus completely filling them both; whereas with hand riveting,
the holes are not nearly so completely filled, as it is impossible with
blows of a hammer to subject the rivets to so powerful or uniform a
pressure as the machine brings upon them.

[Illustration: _Fig. 53._]

QUESTION 102. _What is the strength of riveted seams compared with that
of the solid plate?_

_Answer._ The strength of a riveted seam depends very much upon the
arrangement and proportion of the rivets, but with the best design
and construction, the seams are always weaker than the solid plates,
as it is always necessary to cut away a part of the plate for the
rivet holes, which weakens the plate in three ways: 1. By lessening
the amount of material to resist the strains. 2. By weakening that
left between the holes. 3. By disturbing the uniformity of the
distribution of the strains. The first cause of weakness is obvious
from an inspection of an ordinary seam, riveted with a single row of
rivets, fig. 53. In this we have two plates 7¹⁄₂ inches wide and ³⁄₈
thick fastened with four rivets ¹¹⁄₁₆ inches in diameter and 1⁷⁄₈
inches from centre to centre. The section of the plate calculated with
decimals[29] would therefore be .375 × 7.5 = 2.81 square inches. A
piece ¹¹⁄₁₆ inch wide and ³⁄₈ inch thick would be removed to form each
hole, or a sectional area for the whole plate of .375 × .6875 × 4 =
1.03 square inches, so that the section of the plate would be reduced
through the holes 2.81 - 1.03 = 1.78 square inches. In other words,
on the dotted line _a b_ it will have only about 63 per cent. of the
sectional area of the solid plate.

  [29] In the following calculations all the dimensions have for
  convenience been reduced to decimals.

The second cause of the reduction of strength is owing to the injury
sustained by the plates during the process of drilling and punching.
The knowledge existing regarding this subject is not very accurate,
although numerous experiments have been made to determine the exact
amount of weakening caused by punching plates. It is, however, certain
that in many cases the strength of the metal _left_ between the holes
of boiler plates is reduced from 10 to 30 per cent. by the process of
punching. It is probable, however, that soft ductile metal is injured
less than that which is harder and more brittle. Some kinds of steel
plates are especially liable to injury from punching. It is also
probable that the condition of the punch, and the proportions of the
die used with it, have much to do with its effect upon the metal

The third cause of weakness is owing to the fact that if one or more
holes are made in a plate of any material, and it is then subjected
to a tensile strain, the strain, instead of being equally distributed
through the section left between the holes, will be greatest in that
part of the metal nearest them. This can be illustrated by taking
a band of india-rubber, fig. 54, and cutting a round hole in it to
represent a rivet hole. If we draw two parallel lines, _A B_, across
the band and then stretch it, the lines, instead of remaining parallel
when the band is stretched, will separate most next to the hole, as
shown in fig. 55, indicating that the fibres of the rubber nearest the
hole are strained most. A similar effect takes place when a plate of
iron is stretched, so that a fracture is liable to begin next to the
hole, after which the plate will be broken as it were in detail.

QUESTION 103. _How may a boiler seam like that shown in fig. 53 break?_

_Answer._ It may break in three different ways:

1. By the plate tearing between the rivet holes on the line _a b_.

2. By the rivets shearing off.

3. By the plate in front of the rivets crushing, as shown in fig. 56.

[Illustration: _Fig. 56._]

QUESTION 104. _How can the strength of a boiler seam be calculated at
each of these three points?_

_Answer._ The strength through the rivet holes is calculated by TAKING
THE AREA IN SQUARE INCHES OF THE METAL WHICH IS LEFT BETWEEN THE RIVET
HOLES, AND MULTIPLYING IT BY THE ULTIMATE STRENGTH OF THE METAL AFTER
THE HOLES ARE MADE. Thus, in fig. 53, the area of each of the plates
between the rivet holes is 1.78 square inches. As already stated, good
boiler plate will break at a strain of about 50,000 pounds in the
direction of its fibres,[30] but the strength of the metal left between
punched holes is probably 20 per cent. and that between drilled holes
10 per cent. less than that of the solid plate. We must, therefore, in
calculating the strength of a punched seam, take the ultimate strength
of the metal between the holes at only 40,000 pounds per square inch.
The calculation for the strength through the holes would therefore be:
1.78 × 40,000 = 71,200 pounds.

  [30] Boiler plates should always be so arranged that the greatest
  strain will come on them in the direction of their greatest strength,
  which is parallel with the fibres of the metal.

It has also been found by experiment that the strength of rivets to
resist shearing is about the same as that of good boiler plate to
resist tearing apart, or 50,000 lbs. per square inch. The strength of
the rivets, therefore, is calculated by MULTIPLYING THE AREA IN SQUARE
INCHES OF ONE RIVET BY THE NUMBER OF RIVETS, AND THE PRODUCT BY THE
STRENGTH OF THE METAL TO RESIST SHEARING. The calculation for fig. 53
would therefore be:

  Area of ¹¹⁄₁₆ rivet = .3712 × 4 × 50,000 = 74,240.

or a little more than the strength of the plates through the holes.

The resistance offered by a plate to the crushing strain of a rivet
has been found also by experiment to be about 90,000 pounds per square
inch. It can be proved that the area which resists the crushing strain
of a rivet in a plate, fig. 53, IS MEASURED BY MULTIPLYING THE DIAMETER
OF THE RIVET BY THE THICKNESS OF THE PLATE. The calculation for the
strength of this part of the seam will therefore be: diameter of hole =
.6875 × .375 × 4 × 90,000 = 92,812.

The strength of the solid plate would be EQUAL TO ITS SECTIONAL AREA
MULTIPLIED BY 50,000 POUNDS, or 7.5 × .375 × 50,000 = 140,625 pounds.
The ultimate strength of our seam would then be as follows:

  Plates through rivet holes (tearing) =  71,200 lbs.
  Rivets                    (shearing) =  72,240 lbs.
  Plates in front of rivets (crushing) =  92,812 lbs.
  Solid plate                (tearing) = 140,625 lbs.

It will thus be seen that the strength of the weakest part of the above
seam, fastened with a single row of rivets in punched holes, is very
little more than half (50.6 per cent.) of that of the plates. It will
be noticed that the weakest part of the seam is the plates between the
holes.

[Illustration: _Fig. 57._]

[Illustration: _Fig. 58._]

[Illustration: _Fig. 59._]

[Illustration: _Fig. 60._]

QUESTION 105. _How can the strength of such a single-riveted boiler
seam be increased?_

_Answer._ The most obvious way of increasing the strength of such a
seam is to place, or, as it is called, _space_, the rivets further
apart, which would leave more metal between the holes, and thus
strengthen the seam at its weakest part. But if this is done, it is
said that there is difficulty in keeping the seam water-tight, as the
plates are then liable to spring apart between the rivets. Another way
of increasing its strength is to drill the rivet holes. As already
stated, the difference in the strength of the metal left between
drilled and punched holes has been shown to be from 10 to 20 per cent.
There is also another advantage in drilling the holes for rivets. In
punching them, it is necessary to punch each plate separately, and
even with the utmost care and skill it is impossible to get the holes
to match perfectly. Some of them will overlap each other, as shown in
fig. 57, so that when the rivet is set, it will assume somewhat the
form shown in fig. 58. There is then danger that those rivets which
fill the holes that match each other will be subjected to an undue
strain. If, for example, we have five rivet holes, as shown in fig. 59,
and only the centre ones correspond with each other, then the rivets
in all the other holes will assume somewhat the form shown in fig. 58,
and therefore the centre rivet _c_, in fig. 59, which fits the holes
accurately, must take the strain of the other four until they draw
up “to a bearing.” Under such circumstances, which are not unusual,
there will be great danger either of shearing off the rivet _c_, or
of starting a fracture in the plates, as indicated by the irregular
line _a b_, between the adjoining rivets. It is also obvious that a
rivet like the one in fig. 58 will not hold the plates together so
well as one which fits more perfectly, as shown in section in fig.
53, and therefore there is more danger of leakage between the plates
from badly fitted rivets than from those which fill the holes more
perfectly; consequently rivets which fit imperfectly must be placed
nearer together than those which are well fitted. It is true that
rivets which are set with a riveting machine fill any inaccuracies of
the holes more perfectly than those which are set by hand. But even if
they are made to fill the holes as shown in fig. 60 they are still not
so strong to resist shearing nor so efficient in holding the plates
together as they would be if the holes conformed more perfectly to each
other. In drilling the holes, the second plate can be drilled from the
holes in the first, so that the holes in each will correspond with
each other perfectly. The rivets will therefore fit more accurately,
and consequently can be spaced further apart, and still keep the
plates tight, and thus have more material between the holes, which is
the weakest part of the seam. It has been shown that a rivet ¹¹⁄₁₆
inch in diameter has a resistance to shearing of 18,560 pounds. There
is therefore no advantage in spacing such rivets further apart than
1¹³⁄₁₆ from centre to centre, because the metal left between drilled
holes that distance apart would be slightly stronger than the rivets.
If therefore the rivets are placed further apart, their diameter must
be increased. There is, however, a limit beyond which the diameters
of rivets cannot be increased with advantage, because if we increase
their diameters, their sectional area to resist shearing is increased
in proportion _to the square of the diameter_, whereas the section of
metal in the plate to resist crushing is increased only _in proportion
to the diameter_. This will be apparent if we compare a rivet ¹⁄₂ inch
with one 1 inch in diameter. The first has a sectional area of .1963
inch, the other .7854 inch, or _four_ times that of the first one. Now
the area which resists the crushing strain of the rivets is increased
only in proportion to their diameters, or is _twice_ as much for the
one as for the other. If, therefore, we increase the diameters of the
rivets, we very soon reach a point at which the plate has less strength
to resist crushing than the rivet has to resist shearing. The diameter
of rivet which will give just the same resistance to both strains
varies with the thickness of the plates; with ³⁄₈ inch plates a ⁷⁄₈
rivet will have a resistance to shearing of 30,065 pounds and the plate
in front of it a resistance to crushing of 29,530 pounds. A ⁷⁄₈ rivet
is, therefore, the largest size which can be used to advantage in ³⁄₈
plates. If now we were to space such rivets so far apart that the metal
left between the holes would have a strength just equal to that of the
rivets, we would have the strongest possible seam that can be made with
a single row of rivets. This distance would be 1³⁄₄ inches between the
edges of the rivets, or 2⁵⁄₈ from center to center, as shown in fig.
61. The following table will show the strength of such a seam composed
of four rivets, and two plates 10¹⁄₂ inches wide,[31] with drilled
holes:

  Plates through rivet holes (tearing) 118,125 lbs.
  Rivets                    (shearing) 120,260 lbs.
  Plates in front of rivets (crushing) 118,125 lbs.
  Solid plates               (tearing) 196,875 lbs.

  [31] It has been necessary to take for an illustration, plates of a
  different width from the preceding example, in order to get an even
  number of spaces between the rivets in each case.

[Illustration: _Fig. 61._]

From this it is seen that the strength of the seam with drilled plates
is 60 per cent. of that of the solid plates, or it is about 18¹⁄₂ per
cent. stronger than that made with plates having punched holes and the
rivets nearer together. It should be noted that a great part of the
superiority of the seams made with drilled holes is due to the superior
accuracy of the work done in that way, which makes it possible to
use larger rivets spaced further apart. It is probable that with the
use of some recently designed machines, intended to produce greater
accuracy in punching rivet holes, part of the above advantage may be
realized with that kind of work. The greatest distance that rivets
may be spaced apart without incurring danger of leakage between the
plates must, however, be determined more by practical than theoretical
considerations. It is certain, however, that rivets may be spaced much
further apart than they are in ordinary practice, and the seams still
be kept tight, if the work is done with sufficient accuracy and care.

QUESTION 106. _What other methods are there of making boiler seams
which are stronger than those which have been described?_

_Answer._ In this country two rows of rivets are used and also what is
called a “_welt_,” or _covering-strip_, the latter with both single and
double-riveted seams.

[Illustration: _Fig. 62._]

QUESTION 107. _How are the rivets arranged when two rows are used?_

_Answer._ They are often placed just behind each other as shown in fig.
62, which is called _chain-riveting_. Such an arrangement of rivets
obviously adds nothing to the strength of the seam, because its weakest
part, as has already been shown, is the section of the plates through
the rivet-holes, and this is not at all strengthened by adding another
row of rivets, because the plates are just as liable to break through
the rivet-holes with two rows of rivets as they would be with one.

[Illustration: _Fig. 63._]

A much better arrangement is to place them alternately in the two
rows, as shown in fig. 63. Rivets arranged in that way are said to be
_staggered_, or placed _zigzag_. The method of laying off the holes
and proportioning such a seam in order to get the most strength is,
first, to determine the greatest distance which can be allowed between
the rivet-holes, and yet keep the seams water-tight. Supposing this is
1⁵⁄₁₆ inches,[32] with plates ³⁄₈ inch thick, the diameter of rivet
whose sectional area will give an equal amount of strength must then be
calculated. From the preceding data it will be found that for drilled
plates the resistance of the portion left between such holes will be
22,148 pounds, and a rivet ³⁄₄ inch in diameter will have a resistance
of 22,085 pounds. On the line _a b_, fig. 63, which is to be the first
row of rivets, we will draw one hole, _c_. From the center of this hole
we will describe the arc of a circle, _d e_, with a radius, _c d_,
equal to the sum of the distance between the holes, 1³⁄₈ inches, and
one-half the diameter of the hole, or ³⁄₈ inch, making the radius 1³⁄₄
inches. From _d_, the intersection of this arc with the line of rivets,
_a b_, with the same radius, we will step off the distance _d f_ will
then be the centre of the second rivet-hole on the line _a_, _b_. The
rivet can therefore be drawn, and from its centre, with the same radius
employed before, another arc, _d g_, should be drawn. If now we draw
a rivet-hole (_h_) between the two arcs and touching each of them, we
will have all three of the holes so arranged that the metal between
the holes _c_, _f_, will be just equal to that between them and the
hole _h_. In other words, the strength of the plates on the line _c f_
is just the same as on the line _c h f_. Therefore the strength of the
plates on the straight line _a b_ is just the same as on the zigzag
line _c h f_, etc. The strength of this seam would therefore be as
follows:

  Plates through rivet-holes (tearing) 110,742 lbs.
  Rivets                    (shearing) 110,425 lbs.
  Plates in front of rivets (crushing) 126,562 lbs.
  Solid plates               (tearing) 158,205 lbs.

  [32] That and even greater distances between the edges of the holes
  are now used successfully with ³⁄₈-inch plates.

The weakest portion of this seam, it will be seen, has a strength
of 70 per cent. of the plate, or is 38 per cent. stronger than a
single-riveted seam with punched holes. If we were to use ⁷⁄₈ inch
rivets and make the spaces between them 1³⁄₄ inches, the strength of a
similar seam would be as follows:

  Plates through rivet-holes (tearing) 147,656 lbs.
  Rivets                    (shearing) 150,325 lbs.
  Plates in front of rivets (crushing) 147,656 lbs.
  Solid plates               (tearing) 205,078 lbs.

This seam would then have a strength of 72 per cent. of the solid
plates, or be 42¹⁄₄ per cent. stronger than the ordinary riveted seam
with punched holes. It is important to observe that an increase of
strength results from the use of larger rivets spaced farther apart
than is usual in ordinary practice, and that this is possible only with
the best and most accurate workmanship.

[Illustration: _Fig. 64._]

QUESTION 108. _What is the form of construction of boiler seams made
with a welt or covering-strip?_

_Answer._ The plates (_a_, _b_, fig. 64) are lapped over each other as
for an ordinary seam. Another plate, _c_, about nine inches wide, is
then placed on the inside of the seam and bent so as to conform to the
lap of the two plates. The rivets _r_, whether a double or single row,
pass through all three plates, and two more rows of rivets are put next
to the edges of the covering plate, _c_. It is plain that the strength
of the seam, _r_, is increased up to a certain point by an amount just
equal to that of the rivets in the edges of the covering plate. If,
however, these are placed too close together, the plates _a_ and _b_
will be weaker through the outside rows of rivets than the seam is
through either of the outside ones and the middle one taken together.
If, for example, we take a single-riveted seam, like that shown in fig.
53, whose strength is only a little more than half that of the solid
plate, and should add to it a covering plate, as shown in fig. 64,
and then space the rivets in the edges of the covering plate the same
distance apart as in the middle seam, then obviously the plates would
be just as liable to break through the outer rows of holes as through
the center row before the covering plate was added. If, however, the
holes in the two outside plates are spaced at say twice the distance
apart, or 3³⁄₄ inches, then the only way the seam can break through
the outer rows of holes is by shearing the rivets, because the plates
between the holes are then stronger than the rivets. But before these
rivets can be sheared, the centre seam must give way. Thus the strength
of such a seam is equal to THE SUM OF THE STRENGTH AT THE WEAKEST
POINTS OF THE MIDDLE AND THE OUTSIDE SEAMS. The strength of the plates
between the holes of the outside rows of rivets must, however, be as
great as the sum referred to, otherwise the seam will be the weakest
at that point, and the failure will occur there. The rivets in the
outside rows should be spaced at least twice as far apart as those in
the middle seam. The number of rivets to resist shearing will then be
50 per cent. greater, so that the strength of a seam like that shown in
fig. 53, with a covering plate added, will be as follows:

  Plates through outside rows of rivet-holes (tearing)   91,880 lbs.
  Rivets in one outside and middle row (shearing)       111,360 lbs.
  Plates in front of rivets (crushing)                  139,218 lbs.
  Solid plates (tearing)                                140,625 lbs.

An ordinary single-riveted seam with punched holes, with a welt or
covering plate added, would thus have a strength equal to 65.3 per
cent. of the solid plate, or be 29 per cent. stronger than the seam
without the covering plate. It is probable, however, that the injury
to the plate from punching the outside rows of holes which are further
apart is not so great as it is when they are punched nearer together
and to the edge, so that the strength is somewhat greater than our
estimate.

The relative strength of the different forms of seams described in
percentage of the strength of the solid plate is then as follows:

                                                           Percentage
                                                           of strength
                                                          compared with
                                                           solid plate.
  Single-riveted seam, punched holes        ¹¹⁄₁₆ rivets      50.6
  Single-riveted seam, drilled holes        ⁷⁄₈ rivets        60.
  Double-riveted seam, drilled zigzag holes ³⁄₄ rivets        70.
  Double-riveted seam, drilled zigzag holes ⁷⁄₈ rivets        72.
  Single riveted seam, punched holes with covering plate      65.3

QUESTION 109. _Are there any other forms of boiler seams used?_

_Answer._ In Europe what are called _butt-joints_ are used to some
extent. In these the ends of the two plates abut against each other,
with a covering strip on one or both sides. This form of joint is,
however, not used in this country, and therefore its peculiarities will
not be described.

QUESTION 110. _How are the seams of boilers made water-tight?_

_Answer._ By what is called _caulking_. That is, by the use of a blunt
instrument somewhat resembling a chisel, the end of which is placed
against one or both of the edges of the plates _c_, _d_, fig. 53, which
are then riveted down by blows of a hammer, somewhat as the joints of a
ship are made tight. Before the edges, which are called the _caulking
edges_, of the plates are made tight in this way, they are cut or
trimmed off with a chisel. In this process the plate under the edge is
often injured seriously by the carelessness of workmen, who sometimes
allow the chisel to cut a groove in the plate under the edge, thus
weakening it at a point where the greatest strength is needed. There is
also danger of forcing the plates apart in the manner shown in fig. 65,
if it is done carelessly and with a heavy hammer.

[Illustration: _Fig. 65._]

QUESTION 111. _How are the flat ends of the boiler strengthened?_

_Answer._ By braces, _u_, _u_, _r_, _r_, fig. 41, which are fastened to
the end plates and to the outer shell of the boiler. They are fastened
at one end to ~⟂~ shaped pieces called _crow-feet_, which are riveted
to the end plates of the boiler. At the other end they are made with a
broad foot, which is riveted to the outer shell of the boiler. Especial
attention should be given to the form, proportion and arrangement
of these braces when a boiler is constructed, and they should be
frequently examined while the engine is in use, as they are liable to
be neglected or carelessly constructed and to become weakened or broken
by corrosion, or the constant strain to which they are subjected.
Great ignorance is often displayed in the design and proportions of
these braces, especially in their attachments to the shell of the
boiler.

QUESTION 112. _How should the braces for strengthening the ends of a
boiler be proportioned?_

_Answer._ Every part should be made equally strong. If, for example,
the brace itself is made of a bar of round iron one inch in diameter,
its sectional area would be .7854 square inch. The iron used for these
braces should be of such strength that a force of not less than 50,000
lbs. per square inch of transverse section should be required to tear
it apart lengthwise. A bar of the size referred to would therefore
require not less than 39,270 pounds to pull it apart. All the other
parts should be capable of resisting an equal strain. It is, for
example, not unusual to find a brace of the size we have described,
and even of larger diameter, fastened to a crow-foot which is attached
to the boiler plate with two rivets ⁵⁄₈ inches in diameter. A similar
fastening for the other end of the brace is also often used. The
sectional area of these two rivets is considerably less than that of
the brace, and at the same time the strain is brought upon them at such
an angle as to have a tendency to “snap” them off. For this reason,
and also because a rivet is apt to be deteriorated in strength by the
hammering, the rivets should always have a sectional area very nearly
or quite double that of the bar which forms the brace. The metal around
the eyes through which the pins are inserted should also be carefully
proportioned, and the transverse section at any one point should always
be at least 1¹⁄₂ times greater than that of the bar. The area of the
pins used for attaching the bars to the crow-feet should always be a
little more than half that of the bar. That is, an inch bar should have
a pin not less than ³⁄₄ inch in diameter. When flat braces are used,
it is not unusual to find a bar 3 inches wide with a hole an inch in
diameter punched or drilled so near the end that a pin is sure either
to pull out the end of the bar or else to break it crosswise at the
hole with a much less strain than the brace itself would resist. The
ends of braces should always be enlarged enough to give them sufficient
strength to resist as much strain as the bar itself. Although these
precautions may appear unimportant, and unfortunately are often so
regarded, yet it is upon just such details as these that the lives and
the safety of every locomotive runner, fireman and others near them are
constantly dependent.

QUESTION 113. _How much water is usually carried in a locomotive
boiler?_

_Answer._ There must always be enough water in the boiler to cover
completely all the parts which are exposed to the fire, otherwise they
will be heated to so high a temperature as to be very much weakened or
permanently injured. In order to be sure that all the heating-surface
will at all times be covered with water, it is usually carried so that
its surface will be from 4 to 8 inches above the crown-sheet.

QUESTION 114. _How much space should there be over the water for steam?_

_Answer._ No exact rule can be given to determine this. It may,
however, generally be assumed that the more steam space the better. In
order to increase the steam room, locomotive boilers are very generally
made in this country with what is called a _wagon-top, C_, fig. 41,
that is, the outside shell of the boiler over the fire-box is elevated
from 4 to 12 or even 18 inches above the cylindrical part.

QUESTION 115. _What is a steam-dome and for what purpose is it
intended?_

_Answer._ A _steam-dome_, _X_, fig. 41, is a cylindrical chamber made
of boiler-plate and attached to the top of the boiler. Its object is to
increase the steam room and to furnish a reservoir which is elevated
considerably above the surface of the water, from which the supply of
steam to be used in the cylinders can be drawn. The reason for drawing
the steam from a point considerably above the water is that during
ebullition more or less spray or particles of water are thrown up
and mixed with the steam. When this is the case, steam is said to be
_wet_, and when there is little or no unevaporated water mixed with it
it is said to be _dry_. It is found by experience that wet steam is
much less efficient than that which is dry. There is also danger that
the cylinders, pistons or other parts of the machinery may be injured
if much water is carried over from the boiler with the steam, because
water will be discharged so slowly from the cylinders that there is not
time for it to escape before the piston must complete its stroke, so
that the cylinder-heads will be “_knocked out_,” or the cylinder itself
or the piston will be broken. The reason for drawing or “_taking_”
steam from a point considerably above the water is because there is
less spray there than there is near the surface, and the hottest steam,
which is also the dryest, ascends to the highest part of the steam
space.

QUESTION 116. _Where is the dome usually placed?_

_Answer._ In this country it is usually placed over the fire-box, but
in Europe it is placed further forward, either about the centre of the
boiler or near the front end of the tubes. Sometimes two domes are used
on engines, in this country, one over the fire-box and another near the
front end.

QUESTION 117. _How is the steam conducted from the dome to the
cylinders?_

_Answer._ By a pipe _I m m_, fig. 41, called the _dry-pipe_, which
extends from the top of the dome to the front tube-plate. On the front
side of the tube-plate and inside the smoke-box two curved pipes, _O_,
fig. 41, (shown also in fig. 40,) called _steam-pipes_, are attached
to the dry-pipe at one end, and to the cylinders at the other. The
vertical portion of the dry-pipe in the dome, sometimes called the
_throttle-pipe_, is usually made of cast iron, the horizontal part of
wrought iron, and the steam pipes of cast iron.

QUESTION 118. _How is the loss of heat from locomotive boilers by
radiation and convection prevented?_

_Answer._ By covering the boiler and dome with wood, called _lagging_,
about ⁷⁄₈ inch thick, which is a poor conductor of heat, and then
covering the outside of the wood with Russia iron, the smooth, polished
surface of which is a poor radiator of heat.

QUESTION 119. _What is the smoke-box for?_

_Answer._ The smoke-box _Q_ is simply a convenient receptacle for the
smoke before it escapes into the chimney or smoke-stack, which is
attached to the top of the smoke-box. It also affords a convenient
place for the steam and exhaust pipes, where they are surrounded with
hot air and smoke, and not exposed to loss of heat by radiation. The
front end of the smoke-box is usually made of cast iron, with a large
door in the centre which affords access to the inside.

QUESTION 120. _How are the chimneys or smoke-stacks of locomotives
constructed?_

_Answer._ The forms of smoke-stacks which have been used are almost
numberless. For burning bituminous coal and wood they are generally
made with a central pipe, _R_, fig. 41, and a conical-shaped cast-iron
plate, _S_, called the _cone_ or _spark deflector_, which, as the
latter name implies, is intended to deflect the motion of the sparks
and cinders which are carried up with the ascending current of smoke
and air in the pipe _R_, so as to prevent them from escaping into the
open air while they are incandescent, or “alive.” A wire netting, _t
t_, is also provided, which is intended as a sort of sieve to enclose
the sparks and cinders, and at the same time allow the smoke to escape.
The receptacle _h h_ is intended as a chamber in which the burning
cinders will be extinguished before they escape. For burning anthracite
coal, a simple straight pipe, without a deflector or wire netting, is
ordinarily used.

QUESTION 121. _What are the proportions and materials usually employed
in the construction of smoke-stacks?_

_Answer._ The inside pipe _R_, fig. 41, is usually made of the same
diameter as the cylinders, or an inch or two smaller. For the other
dimensions there are no established rules, excepting for the height
of the top of the chimney above the rail, which is usually from 14 to
15 feet. The outsides of smoke-stacks are made of sheet iron, but the
upper part is now sometimes made of cast iron, so as to withstand the
abrasion of the sparks and cinders longer than sheet iron will. For
very warm and damp climates, the outsides of smoke-stacks are sometimes
made of copper to resist corrosion, which is very destructive to all
iron structures in those countries. The wire netting is made of iron or
steel wire from ¹⁄₁₀ to ¹⁄₃₀ of an inch in diameter, and with from 3 to
4 meshes to the inch.

QUESTION 122. _What is the pipe N, fig. 41, intended for?_

_Answer._ It is intended to conduct the exhaust steam and a portion of
the smoke from the bottom of the smoke-box, where the steam escapes,
to the base of the smoke-stack. In nearly all European engines, the
exhaust steam escapes at the top of the smoke-box just below the
aperture of the smoke-stack. There is, however, often difficulty in
equalizing the draft in the tubes, that is, to get an equal amount of
smoke to pass through all of them. By the use of the pipe _P_, called
the _inside pipe_ or _petticoat pipe_, it is thought that the draft
in the tubes can be equalized much better, as a part of the smoke is
drawn out of the smoke-box at the top and part at the bottom of the
smoke-box. The pipe is usually made in two parts, which slide into each
other like a telescope. The distance of the upper end from the top
of the smoke-box and that of the lower end from the bottom can thus
be increased or diminished, and if the draft is greater through the
upper tubes than through the lower ones, or _vice versa_, it can be
regulated or equalized by simply raising or lowering the top or bottom
of the petticoat pipe. Sometimes this pipe is made with openings and a
kind of deflectors over them between the two ends. It is then called a
_flounced petticoat pipe_, for obvious reasons.

No exact theory can be stated regarding the proportions of these pipes,
or the results effected by them, which can be determined only by
practical experience. Some more accurate knowledge concerning them is,
however, much needed.




PART VIII.

THE BOILER ATTACHMENTS.


QUESTION 123. _How is water supplied to the boiler to replace that
which is converted into steam?_

_Answer._ It is usually forced into the boiler against the steam
pressure by force pumps, but another instrument called an _injector_ is
now much used.

QUESTION 124. _What is the form of construction and principle of the
operation of such force pumps?_

_Answer._ The ordinary single-acting force pump, fig. 66, used on
locomotive and other steam engines consists of a _pump-barrel_, _A
A_, which is a cast-iron or brass cylinder in which a tight-fitting
piston, _B B_, called the _pump-plunger_, works. This piston or plunger
is simply a round rod which works air-tight through what is called
a _stuffing box_, _C_, whose construction will be fully explained
hereafter. The plunger receives a reciprocating motion, usually from
the piston-rod of the engine, but is sometimes worked by a small crank
attached to one of the crank-pins, or by an eccentric on one of the
axles. The pump-barrel is connected with the water-tank of the tender
by the _suction-pipe_, _D_, and with the water-space of the boiler by
the feed-pipe, _E E_. Over the suction-pipe _D_ is a valve, _F_, called
the _suction-valve_, which opens upward, and below the feed-pipe, _E_,
is another valve, _G_, called the _pressure-valve_. These valves are
cylindrical and made of brass, and rest on brass seats, _g_, _g_, to
which they are fitted so as to be water-tight. They work in guides,
_k_, _k_, called _cages_, the form of which is more clearly shown
in the section, fig. 67, and the plan, fig. 68. When the plunger is
drawn out of the pump-cylinder it creates a vacuum behind it, and the
pressure above the valve _G_ closes it, while the atmospheric pressure
on the water in the tank forces it into the suction-pipe, opens the
valve _F_, and fills the pump-cylinder. When the plunger is forced
back again the force with which it presses against the water in the
pump-barrel, _A_, closes the valve _F_, and opens the pressure-valve
_G_, and the water is then forced through the feed-pipe into the
boiler. In order to be certain that the water in the boiler will not
flow back into the pump, and also to prevent all the water and steam in
the boiler from escaping in case of accident to either the feed-pipe or
pump, another valve, _H_, fig. 66, called a _check-valve_, is placed
between the feed-pipe and the boiler. The construction of this valve
is similar to that of the pressure and suction valves. It is inclosed
in a cast-iron or brass case, _I I_. All of these valves have cages in
which they work and which also act as stops, which prevent them from
rising from their seats further than a certain distance. This distance
is called their _lift_, and the successful working of the pumps depends
very much on the amount of lift which the valves have. This is usually
from ³⁄₁₆ to ¹⁄₂ inch.

[Illustration: _Fig. 66._]

[Illustration: _Fig. 67._]

[Illustration: _Fig. 68._]

Over the pressure-valve _G_ is a chamber, _J_, called an air chamber.
When water is forced into this chamber, it is obvious that as soon as
it rises above the mouth of the pipe _E_, the air above the surface, _c
d_, of the water will be confined in this chamber. This confined air,
being elastic, will be compressed and expanded by the pressure of the
water, so that it forms a sort of cushion, which relieves the pump and
the pipes from the sudden shocks to which they are subject, owing to
the rapid motion of the pump-plunger.

Another air-chamber, _K K_, is sometimes placed below the suction-valve
_F_. The object of this is to supply a cushion to relieve the
suction-pipe from the shock which is caused by the sudden arrest of
the motion of the water in the pipe when the valve _F_ is closed.
When the pump-plunger is drawn out, the water flows through the valve
_F_ to fill the vacuum in the pump-barrel, _A A_, and consequently
all the water in the suction-pipe is put in motion. As soon as the
plunger returns, the valve _F_ is closed and the motion of the water is
suddenly arrested, thus producing more or less of a shock in the pipe
_D_. When the water in the air chamber _K K_ rises above the line _a
b_, it is evident that the air above that line will be confined in the
space surrounding the pipe _L_. This air then forms a cushion in the
same way as that in the upper air chamber _J_ does, which has already
been explained. The advantages of the lower air chamber are, it is
thought, more imaginary than real.

QUESTION 125. _How can the pump be taken apart and the valves examined?_

_Answer._ By removing the bolts _e_, _e_, the upper air chamber can
be taken off, and by taking out the bolts _f_, _f_, the lower one can
be taken down, and the valves and cages removed. The check-valve _H_
can be taken out by removing the bolts _l_, _l_, which hold up the
valve-seat _h_ and the valve and cage.

QUESTION 126. _How can it be known whether the pump is forcing water
into the boiler?_

_Answer._ To show this a cock, called a _pet-cock_, is attached to
the upper air chamber in the position shown by the dotted circle
_m_.[33] By opening this cock, if the pump is working, a strong jet
of water will be discharged from it during the backward stroke of the
pump-plunger. If the pump is not forcing water into the boiler, or is
working imperfectly, the stream discharged from the pet-cock will be
weak, and the backward and forward strokes of the plunger will thus not
be very definitely indicated by the discharge from the pet-cock.

  [33] The pet-cock is sometimes attached to the feed-pipe.

Another small cock is often attached to the lower air chamber, or to
the feed-pipe, to allow the water to escape from the pump in cold
weather, when the engine is not working, so as to prevent it from
freezing.

QUESTION 127. _Why is it necessary to be able to regulate the quantity
of water which is forced into the boiler by the pumps?_

_Answer._ Because when the engine is working hard, that is, pulling
a heavy load up a grade, more steam and consequently more water are
consumed than when it is not working so hard, and therefore more water
must be forced in to supply the place of that which is used in the form
of steam. If more water is forced in than is consumed, the water will
rise and fill the steam-space and a part of it will then be carried
into the cylinders without being evaporated. If too little water is
forced into the boiler, the heating surface will not be covered, and
there will consequently be danger that those portions which are exposed
to the fire will be overheated and injured.

QUESTION 128. _How is the supply of water which is fed into the boiler
by the pump regulated?_

_Answer._ By a cock in the suction-pipe called a _feed-cock_, which can
be regulated by the locomotive runner, so that more or less water is
supplied to the pump. There is also a valve in the water tank by which
the supply of water can be regulated.

QUESTION 129. _On what part of the locomotive are the pumps usually
placed?_

_Answer._ They are usually attached to the frames behind the cylinders,
and are worked by the piston-rod, as will be more fully explained
hereafter; but they are sometimes placed inside of the frames, that
is, between the wheels, and worked from an eccentric on one of the
axles, and sometimes they are placed outside of the wheels near the
back part of the locomotive, and worked from short cranks attached to
the crank-pins.

QUESTION 130. _What provision is made for preventing the water in the
pumps from freezing in cold weather?_

_Answer._ Pipes which communicate with the steam-space of the boiler
are attached to each of the suction-pipes, so that, by opening valves
in the former, steam is admitted into the suction-pipes to heat the
water in them. By admitting this hot water into the pump, it is kept
warm, and the water is thus prevented from freezing.

[Illustration: Fig. 69.]

QUESTION 131. _What is an “injector”?_

_Answer._ It is an instrument in which a jet of steam from the boiler
mingles with and forces a continuous jet of water into the same boiler
against its own pressure.

QUESTION 132. _What is the action of the injector and what are the
names of its essential parts?_

_Answer._ All injectors have certain parts in common. These may be
shown in the simplest form of instrument, as in the fixed-nozzle
injector, a section of which (omitting all detail of construction) is
shown in fig. 69.

The steam from the boiler, passing through the pipe _A_, enters the
_receiving-tube C_. Here it is joined by the water which enters the
pipe _B_. The water condenses the steam in the _combining-tube D_, and
a water jet is formed which is driven across the _overflow_ space _F
F_, and enters the _delivery-tube H_, thence past the _check-valve I_
into the boiler. During the passage of the water from _D_ to _H_, as
it passes across the _overflow_ space _F_, if too much water has been
supplied to the steam, some will escape at this point and flow out
through the _overflow nozzle G_, while if too little water has been
supplied, air will be drawn in at _G_, and carried into the boiler with
the water. The names of the essential parts seem very applicable when
we notice that steam is _received_ from the boiler at _C_, _combines_
with the water at _D_, and both are _delivered_ to boiler through _H_.

QUESTION 133. _How is the operation of the injector explained?_

_Answer._ Steam escaping from under pressure has a much higher velocity
than water would have under the same pressure and condition. The
escaping steam from the _receiving-tube_ unites with the feed-water in
the combining-tube, and gives to this water a velocity greater than it
would have if escaping directly from the water-space in the boiler. The
power of this water to enter the boiler comes from _its weight_ moving
at the _velocity_ acquired from the steam, and it is thus enabled to
overcome the boiler pressure.

This can be illustrated with a wooden croquet ball, which will float
on the surface of water and will require considerable force to make it
sink. If, however, it is thrown violently into the water, it will sink
to a considerable depth before its buoyancy will overcome its momentum,
or _actual energy_. If, however, we were to take a very light, hollow
wooden or india-rubber ball, no matter how violently we throw it into
the water, it will not sink, because the total _actual energy_ of
any body IS PROPORTIONAL TO ITS WEIGHT MULTIPLIED BY THE SQUARE OF
ITS VELOCITY, and therefore if we throw the hollow ball at the same
velocity as the solid one, the former will still have much less energy
than the latter. Now, as already stated, steam under a given pressure
escapes from an orifice with a very much greater velocity than water.
But steam being very light, if its weight is multiplied by its velocity
its total energy will be comparatively small. Now in the injector, a
portion of the high velocity of steam is imparted to the heavy water,
because this water is presented to the action of the steam, not in a
mass, as in the boiler, but in small quantity and in such a position
that it can easily escape, so that it gradually acquires as high a
velocity as the escaping steam can impart, and at the same time the
steam is condensed, and therefore there is a heavy substance with
a high velocity, whose actual energy is sufficient to overcome the
pressure in the boiler. If the steam were not condensed we would have
a comparatively light substance moving at a high velocity, which, as
has already been explained, would have little actual energy, and would
therefore not overcome the boiler pressure.

QUESTION 134. _Does this involve any principle like a perpetual motion,
or of work done without consumption of power?_

_Answer_. No, the steam escapes _as steam_, and is returned to the
boiler _as water_ with its bulk reduced, say 1,000 times, and if it
carries with it twenty times its weight of fresh feed-water, there
would still be a loss of pressure or effective force in the boiler
sufficient to do the work required in introducing the water.

QUESTION 135. _Will the injector feed hot water?_

_Answer._ The instrument will not work when the feed-water is too hot
to condense the steam, for the reasons given above, and the amount of
water thrown is always the greatest when the feed-water is the coldest.
Steam at a low pressure can be condensed more readily than steam of
higher pressure, because it contains less heat. The feed-water may be
used hotter to condense low steam than to condense high steam. In using
the injector, the lower the boiler pressure the hotter may be the water
within certain limits, the limit being the possible condensation of the
steam.

QUESTION 136. _Will a “fixed-nozzle” injector, such as has been
described, answer as a boiler feeder on locomotives?_

_Answer._ It will answer at some one pressure of steam, to which
pressure it may have been adapted in making the instrument, and at that
pressure it will work admirably; but it will not work satisfactorily at
any other pressure, either higher or lower, and has not much range in
quantity of water delivered.

QUESTION 137. _What is required to make an injector work at different
pressures?_

_Answer._ The instrument must be so made that the water passage between
the receiving tube and the combining tube can be varied in size. This
is usually done by making the combining and receiving tubes conical and
moving the former to or from the latter, thus contracting or enlarging
the water space. Such adjustment must be made at each change of steam
pressure in the boiler. If this adjustment is made _by hand_, as in
some kinds of injectors, it requires constant attention, if the steam
pressure varies frequently.

QUESTION 138. _How has this regulation been accomplished without such
attention?_

_Answer._ In the SELF-REGULATING INJECTOR, fig. 70, by using the escape
water at overflow to push the combining tube towards the receiving tube
and the indraught of water at the same place to pull the combining tube
away from the receiving tube. This can be explained as follows:

The case _G_ of the instrument has two inlets, one for steam, the
other for water, the two being separated by the plate _F F_. Steam
passes into the _receiving tube A_, and its escape is regulated by a
taper-plug in the end of the rod _B_, moved by the handle _H_. At the
upper end of the _combining tube_ _C_, where it swells out into a bell
mouth, is a piston _N N_, sliding in the case. The lower end at _C_
is guided by the upper end of the _delivery tube_ _D_. The delivery
tube _D_ is stationary. The _overflow_ opening is at _O_. The action
of this instrument may be thus described: Steam entering the receiving
tube _A_ escapes through its lower end when the plug _B_ has been drawn
back. It unites with the water surrounding it in the space _N N_, is
condensed and passes with the feed-water into the delivery tube _D_,
and thence into the boiler. If too much water enters the combining
tube, some will escape at the overflow _O_, and filling the space below
the piston _N N_, will force the combining tube up toward the receiving
tube, and, thus contracting the space between them, will diminish
the water supply; while, if it gets too little water in this space, it
will take some in at the overflow _O_, and thus draw down the piston _N
N_, and enlarge the space, giving more water to the instrument. This
self-regulating principle enables the instrument to continue working
efficiently, no matter how much the steam pressure in the boiler varies.

[Illustration: Fig. 70.]

QUESTION 139. _How do you start this kind of injector?_

_Answer._ The instrument just described is the latest form of
self-regulating injector, manufactured by Messrs. Wm. Sellers & Co.,
and is called by its makers the INJECTOR OF 1876. It is started and
stopped by a simple movement of the lever _H_. This lever _H_ moves a
cross-head _I_, on the guide-rod _J_; it also, by means of stops _T_
and _Q_, on rod _L_, opens and closes the starting-valve _K_. In fig.
70 the instrument is shown shut off, and with the starting-valve _K_
open. On the rod _B_ are two valves, a small one _W_ and a larger one
_X_. A stop or collar is shown a short distance beyond the large valve
_X_. If the lever _H_ be drawn back until this collar comes in contact
with the valve _K_, it will have raised the valve _W_ from its seat,
and steam will escape through a small passage in the centre of the
conical regulating plug. The steam so admitted is sufficient to lift
the water, which will then be driven through _D_, and past the valve
_K_, and escape at _P_. Drawing back the lever _H_ to the end of its
stroke, after the water has been lifted, the large valve _X_ is raised,
and the lug on the lever _H_, coming in contact with the stop _T_, on
the rod _L_, the valve _K_ is closed. The jet is fully established
and the water is driven into the boiler. At the entire end of stroke
of the lever _H_, the latch _V_ falls into notches on the rod _J_,
when, as the lever is moved forward toward the position shown in fig.
70, this latch will click over the notches and hold the lever in any
desired position between the maximum and minimum delivery.

QUESTION 140. _What attachments are needed besides the instrument to
render it effective?_

_Answer._ A globe-valve should be placed in the steam pipe leading
to the injector, to be closed only when there is occasion to remove
the injector when steam is up, and in cold weather, to prevent the
condensation of steam in the pipes at the end of its trips. During all
the working time of the injector, this valve should be wide open.

QUESTION 141. _In what position, and in what location on the engine
should the injector be placed?_

_Answer._ On the right hand side, high enough up to have an air chamber
below the injector, above the top of the water in the tank when the
latter is full.

QUESTION 142. _What is required to keep the instrument in working
order?_

_Answer._ Constant use is better than occasional use. Having two
injectors on the same engine, one on each side, the one on the runner’s
side will be used while running. The one on the other side should
be used when standing. All pipe connections must be tight, so as to
prevent the leaking of air. The pipe carrying steam to the instrument
should be from such part of the boiler as will insure the use of dry
steam, and the waste pipe must not be contracted. The instrument
represented in the engraving is the injector of 1876, manufactured by
Messrs. William Sellers & Co. of Philadelphia. Beside this, Mack’s and
several other kinds of injectors are now used.

QUESTION 143. _How can the height of the water in the boiler be known?_

_Answer._ Two appliances are used by which the height of the water in

The _glass water gauge_.

[Illustration: Fig. 72. Scale ¹⁄₄.]

[Illustration: Fig. 73.

Scale, 3 in. = 1 foot.]

Every locomotive is provided with four or more gauge-cocks, which are
usually placed at the back end of the boiler, where they can easily
be seen and reached. These cocks, _s_, _s_, _s_, _s_, are shown in
fig. 71, which represents the back end of a locomotive, and to which
frequent reference will be made. They are also shown on a larger scale
in fig. 72, which represents the end plate of the boiler in section.
They communicate with the inside of the boiler and are so placed that
one is three or four inches above the other. The two upper cocks are
placed above the point where the surface of the water should be when
the engine is working, and the two lower ones below it, so that the
upper ones communicate with the steam space and the lower ones with
the water. When these cocks are opened, if the water is at its proper
height, steam is discharged from the two upper ones, and water from the
two lower ones.

When a gauge-cock which communicates with the steam space is first
opened, it is usually filled with condensed water, so that it should
usually be kept open for a little while until this water is discharged.
If the upper cocks are opened and continue to discharge _water_, they
indicate that there is _too much_ water in the boiler; on the other
hand, if steam is discharged when the lower cocks are opened, then
there is too little water in the boiler, and the heating surface is
in danger of being exposed to the fire without being covered with
water, and consequently overheated, or as it is called “burned,” and
so injured as to become too weak to bear the strain to which it is
subjected by the pressure of the steam. There is then great danger that
the crown sheet may be crushed down by the pressure of the steam above
it, or that the boiler may be exploded. Even if no accident occur, the
boiler is in great danger of permanent injury from overheating when
the water is allowed to get too low.

Below the gauge-cocks _s_, _s_, _s_, _s_, fig. 71, an inclined
cylinder, _R_, called a _drip-pipe_, is placed with openings to receive
the water and steam which are discharged from the cocks. This water is
conducted away by the pipe _p_.

The _water-gauge_, _P_, fig. 71, which is shown in section in fig. 73,
consists of an upright[34] glass tube, _a a_, which is from one-half
to three-quarters of an inch in diameter, and from 12 to 15 inches
long. The glass is about one-eighth of an inch thick. At its ends it
communicates with the steam and water of the boiler through brass
elbows, _b_, _c_. The openings in these elbows, which communicate with
the boiler, are closed by the valves or plugs, _d_, _e_, which are
worked by screws and handles, _f_, _g_. The glass tube, when it is
attached to the elbows, is made steam-tight by rubber rings, which are
pressed tight around the tube by _packing-nuts_, _h_, _i_. The elbows
are provided with the valves, _d_, _e_, so that in case the glass tube
breaks the steam and water can be shut off, so as not to escape through
the elbows. The lower elbow is provided with a blow-off cock, _k_,
through which any sediment or dirt which collects in the glass tube or
elbows can be blown out. When the valves in the upper and lower elbows
are opened the steam flows into the glass tube through the upper one,
and water through the lower one, and the water assumes a position in
the glass tube on a level with the surface of that in the inside of
the boiler; that is, the position of the water in the boiler becomes
visible in the glass tube. On account of the constant variations of the
water in the boiler, the column of water in the glass never remains
stationary, but plays up and down as long as the boiler is working. But
if the communication between the glass tube and the boiler is closed,
then the water in the tube becomes stationary and the water gauge is
useless. In order that there may be no obstruction of the glass tube by
mud or dirt from the water, it must be _blown out_ often. To do this
the lower valve, _e_, is closed, and the blow-off cock, _k_, and the
steam valve, _d_, are opened. The steam pressure in the tube on top of
the column of water will force it out of the blow-off cock, and the mud
and dirt will be carried with it.

  [34] Sometimes these tubes are, for convenience, inclined, as shown
  in fig. 71.

If from any cause the glass tube is broken, first of all the
water-valve _e_ should be closed and then the steam-valve _d_, so as
to prevent the hot water and steam which will escape from the broken
glass from scalding those who are working the engine. By unscrewing
the nuts _h_ and _i_ the old glass can easily be removed and a new
one substituted in its place.[35] Care should be taken in putting in
new glasses not to screw the packing nuts down any more than just
sufficiently to make the rubber rings steam-tight around the glass
tubes. If they are screwed too tight they are apt to produce a strain
on the tube, so that the slightest expansion by heat or contraction
from cold will break it.

  [35] Extra glasses should always be carried with an engine so as to
  be substituted in case of accident to the one in use.

QUESTION 144. _How is the steam pressure in boilers prevented from
exceeding a certain limit?_

_Answer._ By what are called _safety valves_. These consist of circular
openings, _a_, fig. 74, about three inches in diameter placed usually
on the top of the dome,[36] and covered by a valve, _b_, which is
pressed down either by a lever, _c c′_, and spring, _d_, as shown in
fig. 74, or by a spring alone, as in fig. 76. Two of these valves are
usually placed on the top of the dome, so that if one gets out of order
the other one will allow the steam to escape as soon as its pressure
exceeds that which, it has been decided, the boiler can safely bear.
This pressure, in locomotive boilers, is usually from 100 to 130 pounds
per square inch.

  [36] One of these, _v_, is shown in fig. 41.

QUESTION 145. _How is the amount of pressure which must bear on top of
a safety-valve determined?_

_Answer._ This pressure is determined BY MULTIPLYING THE AREA OF THE
OPENING FOR THE VALVE IN SQUARE INCHES BY THE GREATEST STEAM PRESSURE,
IN POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH, WHICH THE BOILER IS INTENDED TO BEAR. Thus,
if the opening for a safety-valve is three inches in diameter, its
area will be seven square inches, and, therefore, if the greatest
steam pressure which it is intended that the boiler shall bear is 100
lbs. per square inch, the valve must be pressed down with a pressure
equivalent to 7 × 100 = 700 pounds. If the pressure on the valve is
produced by a lever, as in fig. 74,[37] then the total weight of the
safety-valve must be MULTIPLIED BY THE SHORT ARM OF THE LEVER, (or the
distance _A_ between the centre of the fulcrum _e_ and that of the load
_f_,) AND DIVIDED BY _B_, THE TOTAL LENGTH OF THE LEVER. In fig. 74 the
short arm of the lever is 3¹⁄₂ inches, and the whole length 35 inches;
therefore if the valve is to be pressed down with a pressure of 700
pounds, the pressure on the end of the lever would be calculated as
follows:

  700 × 3¹⁄₂
  ---------- = 70 lbs.
      35

  [37] The lever is represented in the engraving with a piece broken
  out, in order to save room.

The spring _d_ must therefore pull down on the end of the lever with
a tension equal to 70 pounds. When the pressure of the spring bears
directly on the valve, as shown in fig. 76, then the tension of the
spring must be just equal to the pressure on the valve. This tension
is produced by screwing down the nuts, _c_, _c_. The spring _d_, which
produces the requisite pressure on the end of the safety-valve lever,
fig. 74, is arranged inside of two cylinders, _g_ and _h_, which
slide over or into each other like the sections of a telescope. This
arrangement is called a _spring-balance_. The spring, _d_, is attached
to the covered ends and draws them towards each other. The upper
cylinder _g_ is connected by a rod, _i_, to the flattened end of the
lever _c′_, which has a hole drilled through it to receive the rod. The
other end of the rod is screwed into the upper cylinder _g_. This rod
is sometimes arranged so that it can be either lengthened or shortened
by the nut _j_. By lengthening or shortening the distance, the tension
of the spring is either diminished or increased. The lower cylinder of
the spring-balance, represented in fig. 74, is attached to a lever,
_m_, which is fastened to the back of the _steam-gauge k_. This is
shown more clearly by fig. 75, which represents the back of the gauge,
and also the lever, _l m_, whose fulcrum is at _m_. The spring-balance
is attached to the lever at _k_. By drawing down the lever the tension
of the spring is increased, and by raising it up it is diminished.
The lever is held in any desired position by the latch, _n_, and the
ratchet _r r_. By this contrivance, which is employed on the engines
built at the Grant and also at the Baldwin Locomotive Works, the
pressure on the valve can at once be either increased or diminished,
which it is often desirable to do, especially when an engine is not
at work. The spring-balance is shown in fig. 71, and is indicated by
the letter _M_ and the lever by _N_. Unless the pressure of the steam
exceeds that on top of the valve, it will of course not be opened. As
there is always danger that a safety-valve or some of its attachments
may become corroded or otherwise disordered, so that it will not act
promptly or with certainty, it is desirable to open it frequently, so
as to be sure that it is in good working order. To do this the pressure
on the valve must be reduced below that in the boiler, which can very
conveniently be done with the _spring-balance_ lever which has been
described.

The lower cylinder of the spring-balance sometimes carries an index or
pointer, _t_, fig. 74, which protrudes through a slot in the cylinder
_g_, and indicates the amount of pressure of the spring on a scale
marked along the slot on the outside of the cylinder. If it is desired
that the safety-valve should open when the steam pressure reaches 100
or any other number of pounds per square inch, the spring-balance is
subjected to a tension which will bring an amount of pressure on the
top of the safety-valve equal in pounds per square inch of its surface
to that of the steam pressure desired.[38]

  [38] In loading a safety-valve allowance must always be made for the
  weight of the lever and the valve.

There should always be some provision made which will render it
impossible to increase the steam pressure beyond that which it has
been determined that the boiler will safely bear. This is usually done
by arranging one of the safety-valves with a lever, as shown in fig.
74, and the other without, like that in fig. 76. The latter is often
covered and sealed or locked up, so as to be beyond the control of the
locomotive runner.

The safety-valves are usually fitted into conical seats, _S S_, figs.
74 and 76, so as to be perfectly steam-tight, and are made with wings
or guides, _t_, _t_, the form of which is shown in the sectional plan
_A_, figs. 74 and 76, under the valve. These guides are intended to
keep the valves in the proper positions in relation to their seats.

[Illustration: Fig. 76. Scale ¹⁄₈.]

As soon as the steam pressure under the valves becomes greater than the
pressure of the springs on top of them, the valves will be lifted up
and the steam will escape until the pressure in the boiler is relieved.
It will be seen, however, that although the surface of the valve which
is exposed to the pressure of the steam is equal to the area of the
opening for the valve, after it is lifted from its seat and the steam
escapes all around the edge, a larger surface will be exposed to the
pressure of the escaping steam. For this reason, it will be found that
after a valve is opened steam will escape, or “_blow off_,” as it is
termed, until the pressure is several pounds lower than it was when the
valve first opened. Advantage has been taken of this fact in the valve
shown in fig. 76, which is called the “Richardson” valve, which is now
much used. The top of this valve is made larger in diameter, so as to
expose more area to the escaping steam. Grooves are also made around
the edge of the valve and the seat. These, it is claimed, produce some
sort of reflex action of the steam, which keeps the valve open longer
than it otherwise would be.

[Illustration: Fig. 78.]

[Illustration: Fig. 77.]

QUESTION 146. _How is the steam pressure in the boiler indicated?_

_Answer._ By an instrument called a _steam-gauge_. There are a great
variety of such instruments made, but they may all be divided into two
classes, and they all operate upon one of two principles. In the one
class the pressure of the steam acts upon a diaphragm or plate of some
kind, as shown in fig. 77, which represents a section of a gauge of
this kind; _a b_ is a metal plate made with circular corrugations, as
shown in section and also by the shading in fig. 78, which represents
a front view of the gauge with a part of the dial-plate removed. The
steam enters by the pipe _c_ and the small opening _d_, and fills the
chamber _e_ behind the metal plate or diaphragm. The corrugations of
the latter give it sufficient elasticity, so that when the pressure is
exerted behind it, it will be pressed outward by the steam. If it were
flat, it is plain that it would not yield, or only to a very slight
degree, to the pressure of the steam. In the centre of the diaphragm
on the outside is a pin or stud, _f_, which bears against the plate.
This stud is attached to a bent lever or “_bell-crank_,”[39] _g h k_,
whose fulcrum is at _h_. To the outer end, _k_, a rod, _l_, figs. 77
and 78, is attached, the lower end of which is connected to the short
arm _m_ of a toothed segment, _n_, whose fulcrum is at _o_. This
segment gears into a small pinion, _p_, which is attached to a spindle
or shaft, which carries a pointer, fig. 78. It is obvious now that if
the diaphragm, _a b_, is pressed outward, it will move the bent lever
_k h g_, the motion of which will be communicated by the rod _l_ to the
toothed segment _n_, which will in turn revolve the pinion _p_, and
thus move the hand or index. We have selected for this illustration
one of many forms of this kind of gauge. The mechanical appliances for
communicating the motion of the diaphragm to the index or pointer are
different in the gauges made by different manufacturers. The form of
the diaphragm also differs. In some cases it is made of a metal plate;
in others a spiral spring is used, covered with india-rubber to make it
steam-tight. The steam-gauge represented by figs. 77 and 78 is the form
manufactured by M. B. Edson, of New York.

  [39] A _bell-crank_ is a lever with an elbow in it.

[Illustration: Fig. 79.]

[Illustration: Fig. 80.]

In the other class of gauges, shown in fig. 79, the steam acts upon a
bent metal tube, _a b c_, usually of a flattened or elliptical section.
It may not be known to all readers that if a tube bent, say in the form
of the letter ~U~ or ~C~, is subjected to the pressure of a liquid or
gas on the inside, the force exerted by the pressure has a tendency to
straighten out the tube. This is due to the tendency which a tube of
an elliptical or flat section has to change the shape of the latter
and approximate to a circular form when the inside is subjected to a
pressure. Thus let _A B_, fig. 80, represent a cross section, and _a b
d c_, a longitudinal section of a part of such a tube contained between
two radii, _O a_ and _O b_, drawn from the centre _O_ of the curve in
which the tube is bent. If now we subject the inside of _A B_ to a
pressure it will have a tendency to assume the form of the circle _C
D_, and would then be represented in the longitudinal section by the
dotted lines _a′ b′ d′ c′_. If now we draw radial lines through _a′ c′_
and _b′ d′_, it will be found that they intersect at _O′_, instead of
_O_, which was the original centre of the curve of the tube. It will
be seen that as the section of the tube approximates to the form of
a circle, the portion _a b_ which is outside the curve will be moved
farther from the centre, while the other side, _c d_, is moved nearer
to it. As indicated by the radial lines, when this occurs either the
outside must be lengthened and the inside shortened, to conform to the
radial lines _a O_ and _b O_, or else the tube will be straightened so
that the radial lines will assume the position _a′ O′_ and _b′ O′_.

The phenomenon of the straightening of the bent tubes of steam gauges
is frequently attributed to the difference between the area of the
inside and outside of the curve. This error was shared by the writer,
until the fallacy of the reasoning which supported it was pointed out
to him.

In the gauge represented in fig. 79, (in which the dial-plate is
removed), one end, _c_, of the tube is attached at _d_ to a lever which
has a toothed segment, _e_, at the other end. The end _a_ of the tube
is connected with the lever at _f_. The connection at _d_, therefore,
forms the fulcrum of the lever. It is obvious that as the two ends of
the bent tube are forced apart by the steam pressure, the lever and the
segment have motion imparted to them. The latter gears into a pinion
on the spindle of the index or pointer, _r r_, which thus indicates on
the dial the degree of pressure in the tube. The latter is connected
with the boiler by a tube attached at _g_. Various forms of this kind
of steam-gauge are also made, but all act on essentially the same
principle.

The position of the steam-gauge on the engine is shown at _M_, in fig.
71.

QUESTION 147. _Why is the pipe which connects the steam-gauge with the
boiler bent as shown in fig. 71?_

_Answer._ To prevent the hot steam from coming in contact with the
metal plate or tube, as it is found that the heat of the steam affects
their elasticity. When a bent tube is used, the steam from the boiler
is condensed and fills the bent portion so that when the steam pressure
comes on the surface of the water it forces it up the other leg of the
tube into the gauge. A cock is attached to this pipe so that the steam
can be shut off in case the gauge should get out of order or require to
be removed while there is steam in the boiler.

QUESTION 148. _How can the accuracy of a steam-gauge be tested?_

_Answer._ When the gauge is in good working order, the index or pointer
moves easily with every change of pressure in the boiler, and if the
steam is shut off from the gauge, the index should always go back to 0.
In order to determine the accuracy of its indications, however, they
should be tested with a column of mercury. This consists of a long,
vertical tube, terminating at its base in a closed vessel filled with
mercury. The gauge is then attached to the top of this vessel and water
or oil is forced into the vessel on top of the mercury and into the
gauge. A pressure of one pound per square inch will force up the column
of the mercury 2.04 inches, so that by graduating the tube into spaces
that distance apart, the divisions will indicate the pressure in pounds
per square inch. Thus, a pressure of 50 pounds would force up the
column of mercury 102 inches, and with 100 pounds pressure the column
would rise 204 inches, and therefore, when the mercury reaches these or
any other points, the steam-gauge, if it is accurate, should indicate
equivalent pressures.

The ordinary steam-gauges are very liable to get out of order, and
therefore they should be frequently tested to ascertain whether their
indications are correct.

QUESTION 149. _What is the steam whistle, and for what purpose is it
used?_

_Answer._ The _steam-whistle_, _W_, fig. 71, and shown in section
on a larger scale in fig. 81, consists of an inverted metal cup or
bell, _A_, made usually of brass. The lower edge of this cup is
placed immediately over an annular opening, _a a_, from which the
steam escapes and strikes the edge of the cup or bell, which produces
a deep or shrill sound, according to the size or proportions of the
whistle. The annular opening _a a_ is formed by the plate or cover, _a
a_, which nearly fills the mouth of the cup _B_, which is attached to
the stem _c_. The latter is screwed into the top, _D_, of the dome.
Communication with the steam-space of the boiler is either opened or
closed by a valve, _b_, which is attached to a sort of spindle, _d_,
which extends upward inside of the stem _c_. This spindle does not
entirely fill the opening in the stem _c_, so that the steam which
enters when the valve _b_ is opened rises and escapes through the holes
_e_, _e_, _e_, into the cup _B_ and out through the annular opening _a
a_. The valve is opened by the lever _E_, whose fulcrum is at _f_. The
end _g_ of this lever is connected by a rod, _h_, figs. 81 and 71, with
the cab, and by a suitable handle or lever, _h′ h′_, fig. 71, it can be
opened and the whistle be blown at any time by the locomotive runner or
fireman to give signals to the trainmen or of the approach of a train
to a station, or to warn persons to get off of the track.

[Illustration: Fig. 81. Scale 1¹⁄₂ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 150. _How is a locomotive boiler emptied and cleaned?_

_Answer._ One or two large cocks, called _blow-off_ cocks, _X_, fig.
71, are placed near the bottom of the fire-box, either in front or
behind, and sometimes on the side. By opening either of these the
water in the boiler is blown out, and much of the loose mud and dirt
is carried out with the water. The cock _X_, fig. 71, is opened by a
handle, _w_, which is connected with the cock by a rod.

In order to clean out the mud and scale which are not entirely loose,
what are called _mud-holes_ or _hand-holes_ are placed in the corners
of the fire-box near the bottom. These are oval-shaped holes, about
4¹⁄₂ inches long and 2¹⁄₂ inches wide, and covered with two metal
plates, one of which is put inside the boiler and the other outside,
and fastened with a bolt through both. Another hand-hole is sometimes
placed in the bottom of the front tube-sheet. When the boiler is
emptied of water these hand-holes are uncovered, and as much dirt is
removed as can be scraped out of these holes. A hose pipe is then
inserted and a strong stream of water is forced in, which washes out
nearly all the loose dirt, so as to leave the boiler comparatively
clean.

When the water is very impure, what is called a _mud-drum_, _M_, fig.
41, is used. Much of the mud and dirt is deposited in this receptacle,
from which it can easily be removed by taking off the cast-iron cover
on the bottom of the drum. The cover is also provided with a blow-off
cock, which is shown in the figure referred to.

QUESTION 151. _What other attachments are there to the boiler of a
locomotive?_

_Answer._ There are two cocks, _a_, _a_, fig. 71, called
_heater-cocks_, which are connected with pipes to the feed-pipes _D
D_, to admit steam to the latter to prevent the water in them from
freezing. There is also another cock, _b_, called a _blower-cock_,
which is connected to the smoke-stack by a pipe _b_, _b_. Steam is
conducted through this pipe and escapes up the chimney in a jet, thus
producing a draft when the engine is not working. This arrangement
is called a _blower_ and is used to blow the fire when the engine is
standing still. The action of the jet is similar to that of the exhaust
steam which escapes up the chimney, excepting that the steam from the
jet escapes in a continuous stream instead of distinct “puffs,” as it
does when it is liberated alternately from one end of the cylinders and
then from the other.

_T′_ is a handle which is connected by a rod, _T′ T_, with the
feed-cock (not shown in the engraving) in the pipe _D_. This cock can
be opened or closed by the handle, and the supply of water fed into the
boiler by the pump can thus be regulated. _J_ is a handle on the other
side of the engine, for regulating the working of the pump on that side.

_e_, _e_ are handles, also connected by rods with the pet-cocks on the
pumps. These cocks can thus be opened or closed, and it can then be
known whether the pumps are working.

_A_ is the furnace door, which is fastened by a latch. The latter has
a chain, _Q_, attached to it by which it can be conveniently opened
or closed. The door also has a circular register with six holes to
admit air into the furnace. These holes can be opened or closed by the
revolving circular disc shown in the engraving.

[Illustration: Fig. 83. Scale ³⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

[Illustration: Fig. 84. Scale ³⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 152. _How are the grates constructed?_

_Answer._ As has already been explained, they are made usually
of cast-iron bars,[40] _A_, _A_, _A_, figs. 82 and 83, called
_grate-bars_. Fig. 82 is a plan, and fig. 83 a horizontal section of
one form of grate. The bars in this kind of grate are usually cast in
pairs, or some times three or more are cast together. They are made
wider on the top than on the bottom edges, as shown in the section,
fig. 83, so that cinders and ashes will fall through easily, and also
to give free access to the air from below. They are usually from ³⁄₄
to 1¹⁄₂ inches wide on the top, and about ³⁄₄ inch on the lower edges.
The spaces between the bars are made from ¹⁄₂ to 1¹⁄₄ inches wide. For
burning wood the bars are placed comparatively close together and are
stationary, but for burning bituminous coal they are usually made so
that they can be moved, in order to shake or stir up the fire, just as
is necessary in an ordinary stove or grate fire. In the grate we have
illustrated the bars, _A_, _A_, are cast in pairs, and run crosswise
of the fire-box. The ends are made with a sort of journals, _b_, _b_,
which rest on two supports, _B_, _B_, called _bearing bars_, which
have suitable indentations to receive the ends of the grate-bars. The
latter have arms, _C_, _C_, fig. 83, cast on the under side, to which
a bar, _D D_, is attached. By moving this bar back and forth, the
grate-bars have a rocking motion imparted to them, as shown in fig.
84. It is evident that in this way the fire over the whole surface of
the grates will be disturbed or shaken. The bar, _D D_, is moved by a
lever, _m m_, shown in fig. 71. An extension piece, not shown in fig.
71, is used with the lever _m m_, so as to increase its length; but
it is removed after it has been used, so as not to be in the way of
the fireman. Grates which have movable bars are called _shaking_ or
_rocking grates_. A great variety of such grates are made and in use,
to describe which would require more room than is available here.

  [40] In Europe and in some few cases in this country they are made of
  wrought iron.

For burning anthracite coal what are called _water-grates_ are used.
These consist of wrought-iron tubes, 2 inches in diameter outside,
which are fastened in the front and back plates of the fire-box and are
inclined upward from the front end, so that there will be a continued
circulation of water through them to keep them cool and thus prevent
them from being burned out by the intense heat of the fire.

QUESTION 153. _How is the fire removed from the fire-box when it is
necessary to do so?_

_Answer._ In bituminous coal burning engines, what is called a
_drop-door_, _E E_, figs. 82, 83 and 84, is provided for that purpose.
This door is supported partly on journals, _d_, _d_, similar to those
in the grate-bars, on which it can turn, and is held up or prevented
from dropping by arms, _e_, _e_, attached to a shaft, _F F_. This shaft
is operated by a lever, _f f_, fig. 82, outside the fire-box.

When the arms are in the position represented in fig. 83, the drop-door
is held up in the place in which it is shown; but when they are turned
as in fig. 84, the door falls down so that the burning coal can be
taken out of the opening at _G_, and, by raising up the ash-pan
damper, _H_, fig. 84, can be raked out on the track or into suitable
pits usually provided for this purpose. The drop-doors are sometimes
perforated so as to admit air to the fuel on top of them.

The grates for burning anthracite coal usually have about four solid
wrought-iron bars between that number of tubes. These bars can be
withdrawn, and the fire then falls into the ash-pan through the opening
left by the withdrawal of the tubes.

QUESTION 154. _How are the dampers of the ash-pan operated?_

_Answer._ They are connected by suitable rods and levers with two
handles, _l_, _l_, fig. 71, which are raised or lowered, thus opening
or closing the dampers.




PART IX.

THE THROTTLE-VALVE AND STEAM PIPES.


QUESTION 155. _How is the steam admitted to and the supply regulated or
shut off from the cylinders?_

_Answer._ By a valve, _h_, fig. 41, called a _throttle-valve_, which is
usually placed at the end of the pipe _I_, near the top of the dome.
Throttle-valves are sometimes placed in the smoke-box at the front end,
_n_, fig. 41, of the dry-pipe. Until within a few years they consisted
of plain slide-valves which covered openings similar in form to the
steam-ports, but smaller in size. The pressure on such valves is of
course greatest when there is no steam underneath, which is the case
when the valves are closed. It is then very difficult to open them, and
as it is important that the supply of steam admitted to the cylinders
when the locomotive is started should be easily regulated, such valves
are objectionable, and therefore the form has been introduced which is
illustrated in fig. 41, and also on a larger scale in fig. 85, which
represents a longitudinal section of the throttle-pipe and valve. This
is what is called a _double-poppet valve_, and consists of two circular
discs, _a_ and _b_, which cover two corresponding openings in the end
of the pipe _I_. When these discs are raised up, as shown in fig. 85,
steam flows in around their edges, as represented by the darts. It will
be observed that the steam pressure in the boiler comes on top of the
disc _a_ and against the under side of _b_. The pressure on the one
thus neutralizes or balances that on the other. If the two discs were
of the same size, the pressure of the one would be exactly the same
as on the other; but as they are joined together and are made to fit
steam-tight on their seats by what are called _countersunk joints_,
their diameters must be somewhat larger than the openings they cover.
The only practicable way, therefore, by which the lower disc _b_ can
be introduced into the end _h_ of the pipe _I_ so as to cover the
lower opening is through the upper opening _a_. For this reason the
lower disc must be made smaller than the upper one, and therefore
the pressure on the upper one, being in proportion to its size, has
a constant tendency to close the valve. As it is of the greatest
importance that a throttle-valve should remain closed after steam is
shut off, and never be opened at any time accidentally, the arrangement
described accomplishes just what is needed--that is, makes the valve
work comparatively easily, and at the same time keeps it closed after
the steam has been shut off.

[Illustration: Fig. 85. Scale ³⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

[Illustration: Fig. 86. Scale ³⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 156. _How is the valve opened and closed?_

_Answer._ By a lever, _O′ O_, called a _throttle-lever_, figs. 85,
86[41] and 71. This lever is connected by a rod, _d_, called the
_throttle-stem_, with a bell crank, _i_, the other arm of which works
the rod _c_, to which the throttle-valve is attached. The rod _d_
works through a steam-tight stuffing-box, _f_, in the back end of the
boiler. The end of the throttle-lever is attached to two links, _g_,
fig. 86, which are fastened by a pin to the stud _h_. These links have
a slight vibratory motion, which enables the pin _k_, by which the
lever _O′ O_, is fastened to the rod _d_, to move in a straight line,
which is necessary in order that the rod _d_ may work steam-tight in
the stuffing-box, _f_. The throttle-lever has a latch, _l_, which gears
into a curved rack, _n_, so as to hold the lever and valve in any
required position. This latch is operated by a trigger, _m_. Various
other devices are used to fasten the throttle-lever and thus hold it in
any position required.

  [41] Fig. 86 is a plan, showing the _top_ of the valve and lever.

QUESTION 157. _How are the steam pipes constructed?_

_Answer._ The steam, after it is admitted by the throttle-valve, as
was explained in answer to Question 155, passes into the throttle-pipe
_I_ and the dry-pipe _m m_, fig. 41. At the front end of the dry-pipe
a pipe, _n_, figs. 40 and 41, which divides into two branches like the
top of the letter ~T~ and is therefore called a T-pipe, is attached.
The steam-pipes _o_, _o_, fig. 40, are connected to each of the two
branches of the T-pipe at one end and to the cylinders at the other.[42]

  [42] In fig. 40 the right-hand side represents a section through the
  steam-pipe _o o_, and the left a section through the exhaust pipe _e
  e_.

[Illustration: Fig. 87. Scale 1¹⁄₂ in. = 1 foot.]

[Illustration: Fig. 88. Scale 1¹⁄₂ in. = 1 foot.]

These pipes, being in the smoke-box, are exposed to great changes of
temperature, and are therefore subjected to expansion by heat and
contraction by cold. The joints are therefore constantly subject to
disturbance by the contraction and expansion of the pipes and so are
difficult to keep tight. It is also practically impossible to construct
the boiler, the cylinders and the pipes with perfect accuracy, and
therefore a small amount of adjustability and flexibility is necessary
in the joints of the pipes. If, for example, the opening _x_ in the
cylinder, fig. 40, were either too near or too far from the cylinder
of the engine, it would be necessary to move the end of the pipe _o_
either to the right or to the left in order to connect it with _x_.
If the joint of the upper end of the steam-pipe were attached to the
T-pipe with a flat joint like that shown at _a b_, fig. 87, it would
be impossible to move the lower end of the steam-pipe either to the
right or to the left without disturbing the joint and causing it to
leak. For this reason these pipes are connected with what are called
_ball joints_, fig. 88, that is, the end _a b_ of one of the pipes is
turned into the form of a part of a sphere,[43] and the other end into
a corresponding concave form. It is known that a sphere will fit into a
corresponding socket in any position; for example, an acorn in its cup
or the bones at the hip or shoulder joints. If, therefore, the pipes
are joined with such spherical or _ball-joints_ as they are called,
the lower end can be moved sideways several inches either way, and the
joint will still be steam-tight if it is then firmly bolted together.
Even after it is bolted together it will have so much flexibility that
the expansion and contraction of the pipes will not cause it to leak.

  [43] The dotted lines indicate what would be the form of the sphere
  if the pipe was solid instead of hollow.

There is, however, still another difficulty. Although the lower end of
the pipe, _o o_, fig. 40, can, with a ball-joint above, be moved in any
direction horizontally, yet if the pipe is too long or too short it
is obvious such a joint will not permit it to be moved up or down. A
joint with a flat surface, like that shown in fig. 87, would, however,
permit such motion in the pipe without leaking. If, for example, the
steam-pipe were ¹⁄₈ of an inch too short, it might be drawn down that
distance, and if the upper joint were then screwed up it would still
be steam-tight. In order, then, to get both vertical and lateral
flexibility in the joints of the steam-pipes, a ring, _a b_, fig. 89,
is interposed between the pipes. One side of this ring is spherical and
the other flat, so that the pipes can move either around the spherical
part or slip up or down or sideways on the flat surface of the ring.
In this way the pipes are flexible and adjustable in every direction,
and for all kinds of motion caused by expansion, or which may be needed
when the parts are put together. Sometimes the joints at one end only
of the steam-pipes are made in this way, and the other is connected
with a simple ball-joint.

[Illustration: Fig. 89. Scale 1¹⁄₂ in. = 1 foot.]

In designing these joints their form should be drawn with a radius, _c
d_, fig. 88, from one centre, _c_, so that the surface of the joint
will form a part of a sphere. If they are drawn from two centres, as
is sometimes done, it is obvious that the surface of the joint will
not be a part of a sphere, and therefore will not have the requisite
flexibility. The surfaces of the joints are carefully turned to the
proper form, and then made steam-tight by scraping or grinding them
with emery and oil, and the pipes are then fastened together with
bolts, _g_, _g_, fig. 89, and flanges, _f_, _f_, cast on the pipes.

QUESTION 158. _How are the exhaust pipes constructed?_

[Illustration: Fig. 90. Scale 1¹⁄₂ in. = 1 foot.]

_Answer._ They are made of cast iron. When two nozzles are used they
are generally cast together, as shown in fig. 90. When only one is
used, the form of the pipes resembles somewhat that of an inverted
letter ~⅄~, as shown in fig. 91, so as to cover the two openings which
connect with the cylinders. The tops of these pipes have rings or
bushings, _a a_, fitted into them, which are held by set screws, _b_,
so that they can easily be removed and others with larger or smaller
openings be substituted. If the openings in the exhaust-nozzles are
small, the steam must be discharged at a higher rate of speed, in
order to exhaust all that is in the cylinders, than if the blast
orifices are larger. Therefore, if the latter are reduced in size, the
draft becomes more violent, but at the same time the _back-pressure_
in the cylinder (which will be explained hereafter) is increased. It
therefore becomes necessary to adjust the size of the blast orifices
with the greatest care, so as to have them just small enough to
produce the required draft and yet leave them as large as possible,
so as to reduce the back-pressure. For these reasons what are called
_variable exhausts_ are sometimes used. In these the blast orifice can
be increased or diminished at pleasure, and thus regulated to suit the
conditions under which an engine is working. A great variety of such
devices has been used, but now nearly all have been abandoned for the
simpler arrangement described, which is not variable when the engine is
working.

PART X.

THE CYLINDERS, PISTONS, GUIDE-RODS AND CONNECTING-RODS.


QUESTION 159. _How are the steam cylinders constructed?_

_Answer._ They are made of hard cast iron, and have the steam and
exhaust ports and valve-seats cast with them. The harder the iron the
better will the cylinders withstand the wear of the pistons and valves,
but they must at the same time be made soft enough, so that after they
are cast the inside can be bored out perfectly cylindrical, the ends
turned off, the bolt-holes drilled, and the valve-seats planed smooth.

Fig. 92 represents a longitudinal section through the centre of the
cylinder and steam-chest. Fig. 94 is a plan of the same parts with the
cover of the steam-chest and the valve removed. The left-hand side
of fig. 95 shows a transverse section through the centre _c d_, fig.
92, of the cylinders, and the right side is a section through the
steam-pipe _G h_, fig. 94. The same letters indicate like parts in the
three different views.

The cylinders of locomotives in this country are now universally placed
on the outside of the wheels, as has already been described. In order
to fasten them securely together and to the boiler, they are attached
to what is called a _bed-plate_ or _bed-casting_, _D D_, figs. 94 and
95, which is placed between them. Some builders make this bed-casting
in a separate piece, and the cylinders are then bolted to it on the
outside, about at the dotted lines, _l_, _m_, fig. 95. Others cast
one-half of it with each cylinder, as shown in our engravings, and then
bolt them together at the line _i_, _j_, which is the centre of the
engine. The bed-casting is also bolted to the smoke-box by the flanges
_E_, _E_. The cylinders are bolted to the frame _F_ with bolts, _m_ and
_k_, fig. 95.

After the cylinders are bored out, and the ends turned off, _heads_,
_A_ and _B_, figs. 92 and 94, are fitted with steam-tight joints to
each end. These heads are fastened with bolts and nuts, _a_, _a_, _a_,
to flanges, _C_, _C_.

QUESTION 160. _How is the steam conducted to and from the cylinders?_

_Answer._ Two pipes or passages are cast in each cylinder, the one, _G
G′_, fig. 95, for admitting steam into the steam-chest, and the other,
_H H′_, for exhausting it from the cylinders. The one _G G′_ is called
the _steam-passage_, and the other, _H H′_, the _exhaust-passage_. The
steam-passage terminates at one end with a round opening, _G_, figs.
94 and 95, to which the steam-pipe _o_, figs. 40 and 95, is attached
inside of the smoke-box. At the other end it divides into two branches,
_G′_, _G′_, fig. 94, each of which terminates in an opening, _g_, _g′_,
inside of the steam-chest. The steam is thus delivered at both ends of
the chest, and can pass freely into each of the steam-ports. By making
the cylinders in this way, they are exactly alike for each side of the
engine, or, to use a shop phrase, there are “_no rights and lefts_,”
so that a cylinder casting can be used for either side of the engine.
This method of making cylinders has been adopted by a number of the
principal builders in this country, but is by no means universal.

[Illustration: _Fig. 93._]

[Illustration: Fig. 94. Scale ³⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

[Illustration: Fig. 95. Scale ³⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 161. _How is the steam-chest constructed?_

_Answer_. It usually consists of two castings, one of which, _J_, figs.
92 and 94, is a square cast-iron box made open at the top and bottom.
This rests on the top of the cylinder casting and is joined to the
latter with a steam-tight joint. On top of it is a cast-iron cover, _K
K_. The steam-chest and cover are held down by bolts, _p_, _p_, which
are screwed into the cylinder casting and have nuts on top.

QUESTION 162. _How are the slide-valves made to work steam-tight on the
valve-seats?_

_Answer_. They are first planed off smooth, and then filed and scraped
until the two touch each other over the whole of their surfaces in
contact. The valve-stem _v_, fig. 92, works steam-tight through a
stuffing-box on the steam-chest.

QUESTION 163. _How are the valves and pistons oiled?_

_Answer_. The oil is usually introduced into the steam-chest through a
cock, _c_, fig. 92, called an _oil-cock_. From this cock it flows down
upon the valve and is conducted by suitable holes and channels to the
valve-face and from there through the steam-ports to the cylinder and
piston. Sometimes, for greater convenience, oil-cocks _c_, _c_, fig.
71, are placed inside of the cab and communicate by pipes with the
steam-chests.

The valves are oiled by pouring oil or melted tallow into the oil-cocks
when the steam is shut off from the steam-chests and cylinders. When
the pistons are working in the cylinders without steam, they create
a partial vacuum, so that if oil is then poured into the oil-cocks it
will be sucked into the steam-chests, or, in other words, it will be
forced in by the pressure of the air above it. _Q_, fig. 71, is a shelf
attached to the boiler to receive an oil-can filled with oil or tallow,
which is thus melted or kept in a fluid condition by the heat of the
boiler.

QUESTION 164. _How are the cylinders and steam-chests protected so as
to prevent, as far as possible, the heat in the steam from being lost?_

_Answer._ The sides of the cylinders are covered with wood, _w_,
_w_, _w_, fig. 95, called the _cylinder lagging_, and the wood is
covered outside with Russia iron or brass, which is called the
_cylinder-casing_. The ends of the cylinders have light metal covers,
called _cylinder-head covers_, made of cast iron, brass or sheet metal.
The steam-chest is covered in a similar way so as to be surrounded
either with a covering of wood or of confined air. Sometimes coarse
felt is used for the purpose. The covering, excepting the cylinder
lagging, is not shown in the engravings.

QUESTION 165. _For what purpose are the cocks C, C, figs. 92 and 95, at
each end of the cylinder, used?_

_Answer._ They are used to exhaust the water which collects in the
cylinders. When the engine is not working the cylinders and steam-pipes
are all cooled off, so that when steam is first introduced into them
a great deal of it is condensed until they become warmed. Water is
also frequently carried over from the boiler with the steam. When
this occurs the boiler is said to _prime_, or to “_work water_.” This
water and that produced by the condensation of steam collect in the
bottom of the cylinder and will not escape through the exhaust-pipes
until the piston moves up so near to the end of the cylinder that the
water will fill the whole space between it and the cylinder-head.
As has already been stated, it will then escape so slowly that the
momentum of the piston and other machinery is liable to “knock out”
the cylinder-heads or even break the cylinder itself. The cocks _C_,
_C_, called _cylinder-cocks_, are therefore placed in the under side of
the cylinder, so that when they are open if there is any water in the
cylinder it will escape through the cocks. They are therefore always
opened when the engine is starting, or at any other time when there is
any indication that there is water in the cylinders.

QUESTION 166. _How are these cocks opened and closed?_

_Answer._ A shaft, _R R_, figs. 92 and 94, which extends across the
frames, has an arm, _R S_, fig. 92, at each end. These arms are
connected by rods, _S T_, with the handles of the cylinder-cocks.
The shaft also has a vertical arm, _R U_, the upper end of which is
connected by a rod with the cab. At the end of the rod is a suitable
handle, _f_, fig. 71, by which the cocks can be either opened or closed
at pleasure by the locomotive runner.

QUESTION 167. _How is the piston-rod fastened to the piston?_

_Answer._ It fits into a straight or tapered hole in the piston-head,
in which it is fastened either with a key, _k k_, as shown in figs. 96
and 97,[44] or by a nut on the front side of the piston.

  [44] Fig. 96 is an end view of the piston with the follower-plate
  removed. Fig. 97 is a section through the centre.

[Illustration: Fig. 96.]

[Illustration: Fig. 97.

Scale 1¹⁄₂ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 168. _How is the piston constructed?_

_Answer._ It is made of two cast-iron pieces, _B_ and _C_, fig.
97, the one, _B_, called the _piston-head_ or _spider_, to which
the piston-rod _D_ is attached. The other part, _C_, called the
_follower-plate_, is bolted to the piston-head by the bolts _c_, _c_,
called _follower-bolts_. The piston-head has lugs or projections, _d_,
_d_, _d_, fig. 96, cast on the inside, to which the follower plate is
bolted. Hollow spaces are thus left between these lugs.

QUESTION 169. _How is the piston made to work steam-tight in the
cylinder?_

_Answer._ By means of two rings, _A_, _A_, figs. 96 and 97, called
_packing-rings_. These rings are turned of the same size or a little
larger in diameter than the cylinder. They are then cut open at one
point in their circumference so that they can be pressed apart or
expanded by the springs _a_, _a_, called _packing springs_, on the
inside of the rings. These springs are pressed out by the nuts and
bolts _b_, _b_, called _packing-bolts_ and _packing-nuts_, so that
when the rings wear they can be expanded so as to fill the cylinder
completely. The place where the one ring is cut is placed opposite that
of the opening in the other ring, or they are made to _break joints_,
as it is called. This is done to prevent the steam which leaks through
the opening where the one ring is cut from passing through to the other
side of the piston. These rings are usually made of brass and have
grooves, _c_, _c_, fig. 97, turned in them, which are filled with what
is called Babbitt’s metal. This metal is used because it is less liable
to scratch the cylinders than brass alone. Another ring, _l l_, made of
cast iron and as wide as the two brass rings, is placed inside of the
latter and is intended to furnish a bearing for the springs, and thus
distribute the pressure of the springs equally on the packing rings.
This iron ring is also cut open at one point.

QUESTION 170. _How is the piston-rod made to work steam-tight through
the cylinder-head?_

_Answer._ By what is called a _stuffing-box_. This consists of a
cylindrical chamber, _r r_, fig. 92, which is made about 1¹⁄₂ inches
larger in diameter than the piston-rod. This leaves a space ³⁄₄ of an
inch wide all around the rod. This space is filled with hemp or some
other fibrous material, called _packing_, saturated with oil or melted
tallow. This packing is compressed by a hollow cylinder, _s s_, called
a _gland_, the inside of which fits the piston-rod and the outside the
stuffing-box. This gland is forced into the stuffing-box by nuts, _t_,
_t_, which are screwed down on a flange, _u_, attached to the gland.
The packing is thus compressed in the stuffing-box and forced against
the piston-rod, which is made smooth and perfectly round and straight,
and against the side of the stuffing-box, so that no steam can escape
around the piston-rod. A brass ring or “_bushing_” is often put into
the cylinder-head and in the gland where it touches the piston-rod,[45]
because brass will bear the friction of the rod better than cast iron,
and when it is worn out it can be removed and a new one substituted in
its place.

  [45] Locomotive piston-rods are now usually made of steel.

QUESTION 171. _Why is the end of the piston-rod made to work in guides?_

_Answer._ Because it must move in a straight line if it and the piston
work steam-tight in the cylinder. By referring back to fig. 2, it
is obvious that if a pressure be exerted against the piston _B_ and
communicated to the crank-pin _N_ by the connecting-rod _E_, the
latter, excepting at the dead-points, will exert a pressure either
upward or downward, according to the direction the piston is moving.
This pressure would bend the piston-rod if no provision were made to
prevent it. For this reason, therefore, the end of the piston-rod
is attached to what is called a _cross-head_, _L_, figs. 92 and 94,
which works in guides, _M_, _M_. The cross-head is made of cast iron
and has slides, _N_, _N_, figs. 93 and 94, one on each side, each of
which works between a pair of guide-bars or rods, _M_, _M_, shown
in section in fig. 93.[46] These guide-rods, or _guides_ as they
are called, are planed and finished with great accuracy so as to be
straight and smooth, and are attached to the cylinder-head at one end,
and to a support, _O_, called the _guide-yoke_, which is fastened to
the frame at _F_, fig. 94, and also usually attached to the boiler.
The guides are set with great care, so as to be exactly parallel with
the axis or centre line of the cylinder, so that the cross-head will
slide in exactly the same path that the piston-rod will if it moves
in a straight line. If then the piston-rod and the connecting-rod are
attached to the cross-head, all the strain produced by the obliquity
of the connecting-rod will be borne by the guides, thus relieving the
piston-rod, and making it certain that it will move in a straight line.

  [46] Fig. 93 is a transverse section through the guides at _n_, fig.
  92.

QUESTION 172. _How are the piston and connecting-rods attached to the
cross-head?_

_Answer._ The end of the piston-rod fits into a tapered hole in
the cross-head and is held by a key, _w_, figs. 92 and 94. The
connecting-rod is attached to a pin, _Q_, called a _wrist-pin_, which
is cast with the cross-head.

QUESTION 173. _How is the wear of the slides lessened and compensated?_

_Answer._ Sometimes they are made with brass wearing pieces called
_gibs_, shown at _N_, _N_, fig. 93, which are placed between the
slides and the guides. These gibs can either be removed and new ones
substituted when they become very much worn, or by inserting thin
pieces of metal, called liners, between them and the cross-head, they
will be spread apart so as to fill the space between the slides.
The slides are now, however, oftener made without gibs, and have
recesses either cast or drilled in them, which are filled with either
Babbitt’s metal or glass bearings, which latter are said to wear very
well. The guides are bolted at each end to blocks, _x_, _x_, called
_guide-blocks_, which can be planed off so as to bring the guides
nearer together when they and the slides are worn. Sometimes liners are
placed between the blocks and the guides, which can be removed when it
is necessary to bring the guides nearer together.

QUESTION 174. _Are the top and bottom guides worn alike?_

_Answer._ No: the top guide in ordinary engines is worn the most,
because the pressure of the slides is always on the top guide when the
engine is running forward, and on the bottom guide when it is running
backward. This will be understood by referring back to the series
of figures from 11 to 24. It will be noticed that in the backward
stroke of the piston, represented by figs. 11 to 17, the strain on
the connecting-rod tends to _push_ the cross-head upward, and in the
forward part of the stroke, figs. 18 to 24, the connecting rod _pulls_
the cross-head in the same direction. If the crank turned the opposite
way, this action would be reversed and the cross-head would then be
alternately pushed and pulled downward, and the bottom guides would
then be worn the most. As nearly all locomotives run forward more than
backward, the top guides are usually worn the most.

QUESTION 175. _How are the slides oiled?_

_Answer._ Oil cups, _n_, _o_, figs. 92, 93 and 94, are placed about the
middle of the top guide. These cups usually have a reservoir to hold a
supply of oil, and are so constructed that it will be gradually fed on
the slides, which are thus constantly and regularly lubricated.

QUESTION 176. _How are the pumps worked from the piston-rods?_

_Answer._ The pump-plunger is attached to a projection, _W_, figs.
92 and 93, called the _pump-lug_, cast on one of the slides of the
cross-head. The plunger thus receives a reciprocating motion from the
piston.

QUESTION 177. _How are the connecting-rods made?_

_Answer._ They are made of flat bars of wrought iron. The rods
which connect the cross-heads with the driving-wheels are called
_main connecting-rods_, and the rods which connect or couple the
driving-wheels together are called _coupling-rods_.[47] Fig. 98
represents a side view and a plan of a main connecting-rod. In the side
view the end _B_, and in the plan both ends of the rod are shown in
section. It is attached to the wrist-pin at _A_ and to the crank-pin at
_B_. Fig. 99 represents similar views of a coupling-rod. To save room
in the engraving each of these rods is represented with a part of the
middle broken away. The main rods are usually made wider at _G_, next
the crank-pin, than at the other end, as it has been found that they
are most liable to break at that end. The coupling-rods are now made
either straight or somewhat wider in the centre.

  [47] They are also often called _side_ or _parallel-rods_, but the
  term _coupling-rods_ is considered the best.

[Illustration: _Fig. 98._]

[Illustration: _Fig. 99._

Scale ³⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 178. _How are these rods prevented from getting loose on the
pins from the wear of the latter in the inside of the holes of the
rods?_

_Answer._ The ends of the rods are provided with what are called
_brass-bearings_,[48] or “_brasses_,” _c_, _d_, and _e_, _f_. These
brasses are made in pairs, so as to embrace the pins, from each side.
They are held by ~⊃~-shaped clamps, _s s s_, called _straps_, which are
bolted to the rods. When the brass-bearings become worn, they are
taken out of the straps, and a portion of their surfaces of contact
with each other is filed away, thus allowing them to come nearer
together, and thereby reducing the size of the hole which receives the
pin or journal. In order to prevent their being loose in the straps,
tapered or wedge-shaped _keys_, _k_, _k_, which bear against the
brasses, are fitted in the straps and rods. By driving down these keys
the brass bearings are forced together, thus reducing the size of the
hole for the journal, and making the rods fit tightly on the pins. A
hard steel plate, shown by dark shading in the engraving, is sometimes
interposed between the keys and the brasses to prevent the key from
indenting the surface of the soft brass. As the keys are very liable to
get loose and fall out, they are held either by screws and nuts, _x_,
_x_, as shown in the engraving, or by _set-screws_ on the side of the
rods. The whole arrangement of straps, keys and brasses is called a
_stub-end_.

  [48] The portion of a shaft pin or spindle subjected to friction is
  called a _journal_, and the surface which presses or “bears” against
  it is called a _bearing_.

QUESTION 179. _How are the journals of the crank-pins oiled?_

_Answer._ By oil-cups attached to the straps, above the journals,
similar to the cups used on the _guide-rods_, but which are not shown
in the engravings of the connecting-rods. Sometimes _oil-cellars_, as
they are called, are attached to the under side of the straps. These
are metal boxes, which are filled with oil, which is agitated violently
by the rapid motion of the rods, and is thus applied to the journals
through holes drilled in the straps. In order to confine the oil and
prevent its leaking out around the journals of the coupling-rods, the
brasses at _n_, _n_, fig. 99, are usually made so as to enclose the
outside end of the crank-pin, which thus not only keeps the oil in, but
excludes the dust. The brasses are usually lined with Babbitt’s or some
other kind of soft metal, which is thought to be less liable to heat
from the friction of the journals.

QUESTION 180. _Are the coupling-rods always made with stub-ends?_

_Answer._ No; their ends are sometimes made in one piece--that is,
without straps or keys. The holes which receive the crank-pins then
have brass rings or _bushings_, as they are called, which fit tightly
and are driven into the holes, and form the bearings on the pins. When
these rings become worn they are driven out and new ones put in.

QUESTION 181. _What is meant by the term lost motion?_

_Answer._ It is used to designate the wear of machinery, which causes a
loss of motion in some of the parts. Thus if the bearings of the main
connecting-rods are worn, the piston must move a distance equal to the
wear at each end of the stroke before it moves the crank-pin. Lost
motion might therefore be called the looseness of the parts. When we
speak of _taking up_ the lost motion, we mean making parts which were
loose fit tightly.




PART XI.

THE VALVE-GEAR.


QUESTION 182. _What is meant by the valve-gear of a locomotive?_

_Answer._ By the valve-gear is meant the arrangement of eccentrics,
rods, links, rockers, etc., by which the valves are moved and their
motion regulated.

QUESTION 183. _What is required of the valve-gear in working a
locomotive?_

_Answer._ It must be so arranged that the locomotive can be run
either backward or forward, and so that the motion of the wheels can
be reversed quickly and with certainty. It should enable the runner
to employ the greatest power of the engine by admitting steam into
the cylinders during the whole or nearly the whole of the stroke of
the pistons, or when less power is required, to use the steam more
economically by working it expansively, which latter is accomplished
with the present appliances by changing the travel of the valve.

QUESTION 184. _How is the valve-gear constructed so as to run the
engine either backward or forward?_

_Answer._ As already explained, in answer to question 76, two
eccentrics are provided for each cylinder. These are set so that one of
each pair will run the locomotive in one direction, and the other two
the reverse way.

QUESTION 185. _How must the eccentrics for each cylinder be set in
order that the one may run the engine forward and the other backward?_

_Answer._ This can be best explained by reference to fig. 100, in
which the piston, _P_, is represented at the beginning of the backward
stroke, and the valve _V_ has the requisite lead and is just about to
open the front steam-port. It is obvious that, in order to complete the
backward stroke of the piston, the front port must be opened to admit
steam into the front end of the cylinder, and therefore the valve must
be moved in the direction indicated by the dart _a_. To do this, the
upper arm of the rocker _r_ must move in the same direction, and the
lower arm must be moved the reverse way, as indicated by the dart _e_.
If the crank is intended to move in the direction indicated by the dart
_N_, then the centre of the eccentric must be above the centre of the
shaft or axle, in order to move the rocker in the direction indicated
by the dart _e_. Supposing, however, it was intended to move the crank
the reverse direction, as shown by the dart _N_ in fig. 101; it is
evident in that case that the valve must be moved in the same direction
as before, in order to open the front steam-port and thus admit steam
to force the piston back. But if the crank turns in the direction shown
by the dart _N_, fig. 101, then the centre of the eccentric must be
placed _below_ the centre of the axle in order to move the lower rocker
arm in the direction of the dart _e_ and the valve in that indicated by
_a_. It will thus be seen that the centres of the eccentric for running
forward and that of the one for running backward must be placed, the
one above and the other below the centre of the axle at the beginning
of the stroke of the piston, as shown in figure 101.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 100._

  _Fig. 101._

  _Fig. 102._

Scale ³⁄₈ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 186. _Why is it that the centres of the eccentrics are not
placed opposite to each other on the axle?_

_Answer._ Because before the beginning of the stroke of the piston it
is necessary to move the valve from its middle position a distance
equal to the lap before the steam-port begins to open. If we have a
valve like that shown in fig. 10--that is, without any lap--the centres
of the eccentrics could be placed at right angles, or, as mechanics
say, “square” with the crank, as was shown in fig. 11, and exactly
opposite to each other, because such a valve begins to take steam
as soon as it moves from the middle of the valve-face. If, however,
we have a valve like that shown in fig. 27, it is plain that before
it will admit or _take_ steam, as it is called, in either of the
steam-ports, it must be moved from the centre of the valve-face, or its
_middle position_, a distance equal to the lap, L. For this reason,
therefore, the eccentric, instead of being placed at _half-throw_,[49]
as it is called, must be so far ahead of the middle position as to
have moved the valve a distance equal to the lap, and if any lead is
given to the valve, equal to the lap and lead together. In figs. 100
and 101, _f g_ is a vertical line at right angles to the crank at the
beginning of the stroke. It will be seen that the centre of each of the
eccentrics is set far enough ahead of this line to give the valve the
required lead. When the piston reaches the back end of the cylinder,
the two eccentrics will occupy the position shown in fig. 102, in which
position the lower one would move the valve so as to turn the crank
in the direction of the dart _N_, and the upper one in the reverse
direction. It will be seen that in this position both of the eccentrics
are again ahead of half-throw, when the piston is at that end of its
stroke.

  [49] This would be at right angles to the crank when the piston is at
  the end of the stroke.

[Illustration: _Fig. 103._

Scale ³⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 187. _How is the motion of either eccentric communicated to
the valve?_

_Answer._ The ends of each pair of eccentric-rods are connected
together by a link, _a b_, fig. 103. This link has a curved groove or
slot, _a b_, in it, in which a block, _B_, fits accurately, so that it
can slide freely from one end to the other. This block is attached to
the lower rocker-arm by a pin, _c_, which works freely in the block.
The two eccentric-rods _C_ and _D_ are attached to the ends of the
link at _e_ and _f_ by pins and knuckle-joints. It is apparent that if
the link is down, or in the position shown in fig. 103 and also on a
smaller scale in fig. 104, the motion of the upper eccentric-rod, which
is usually used for the forward motion, will be imparted to the rocker,
and thus to the valve, and when the link is in the position shown
in fig. 105, that the valve will be moved by the lower or backward
eccentric-rod _B_. In order to reverse the engine, it is then only
necessary to provide the means of raising and lowering the links. This
is done by a shaft, _A_, fig. 103, called a _lifting-shaft_, which has
two horizontal arms, _E_,[50] one for each link, and a vertical arm,
_F_. The links are suspended from the ends of the horizontal arms by
rods or bars, _g h_, called _link-hangers_, which are connected to
the links and to the arms above by pins, which enable the hangers to
vibrate freely. The lower pin is attached to a plate, _L d_, called
a _link-saddle_, which is bolted to the link. The vertical arm of the
lifting-shaft is connected by a rod, _G G_, called the _reverse-rod_,
to a lever _O_, _O_, Plate II. in the cab called a _reverse-lever_, the
construction of which will be explained hereafter. This lever is worked
by the locomotive runner, and by moving the upper end of it forward,
the link will be lowered, and the rocker and valve will be moved by the
forward eccentric; and if the reverse-lever is moved back, the link
will be raised, and the backward eccentric will move the valve. When
this is done, the valve-gear is said to be thrown into the _forward_ or
_backward motion_, or _forward_ or _back gear_.

  [50] Only one of these is shown in the engraving.

QUESTION 188. _How is the travel of the valve changed by the motion of
the link?_

_Answer._ By either raising or lowering the link, so that the
link-block and rocker-pin will be some distance above or below
the eccentric-rods. Thus in fig. 104, the motion of the upper
eccentric-rod, and in fig. 105 that of the lower or _back_
eccentric-rod is communicated to the rocker-pin and the valve.
If, however, the link should be raised so that the link-block and
rocker-pin are somewhat below the upper or forward eccentric-rod, as
shown in fig. 106, then the motion imparted to the rocker and valve
will partake somewhat of that of the upper and also of the lower
eccentric-rod. So long as the rocker-pin is above the centre of the
link, the motion of the valve will partake most of that of the upper
or forward rod, and the engine will then run forward, but when the
rocker-pin is below the centre of the link, its motion will be
influenced more by the back eccentric-rod, and the engine will then run
backward.

The motion of the link, which is somewhat complex and difficult to
understand clearly, will perhaps be understood better if we represent
it in a number of successive positions of the whole stroke of the
piston, as was done to show the motion of the eccentric in figs. 11 to
24. We will therefore suppose that the link is in what is called _full
gear forward_, as shown in figs. 103 and 104. In fig. 108 the link is
in the position it would occupy at the beginning of the stroke of the
piston; in fig. 109 it is in that which it will be in when the piston
has moved four inches; in fig. 110, when it has moved eight inches; in
fig. 111, twelve; and in figs. 112, 113 and 114, sixteen, twenty and
twenty-four inches. Figs. 114 to 119 represent the successive positions
of the link during the return stroke. In order to show the different
positions of the link we have represented on a larger scale, in fig.
120, the successive positions of the centre line of the link, which
will indicate the motion imparted by it to the rocker. In order to
designate each of these positions, the centre lines in fig. 120 are
numbered + and -0, 4, 8, etc., etc., to correspond with similar numbers
in figs. 108 to 119.

Thus the line _-0 -0_ represents the position of the centre of the
link which it occupies at the beginning of the stroke as shown in fig.
108. The line -4 -4, that represented by fig. 109, when the piston has
moved 4 in. The lines -8 -8, -12 -12, -16 -16, -20 -20, 24 24, +4 +4,
etc., the successive positions of the centre of the link represented
in figs. 108 to 119. The dotted lines _h a_ and _h b_ represent the
two extreme positions into which the rocker-arm would be moved by
the action of the link. It will be seen that when the link is in the
position shown, it imparts the full stroke of the eccentrics to the
rocker-pin and consequently to the valve. We will now suppose that the
link is raised up as shown in fig. 106, so that the position of the
rocker-pin is just half-way between the end of the eccentric-rod and
the centre of the link. This position is called _half-gear_. In fig.
121 the different positions of the centre line of the link and of the
rocker have been laid out for half-gear in the same way as was done
for full-gear before. From this it will be seen that the travel, _a
b_, imparted to the rocker-pin and valve by the link when it is in the
position shown, instead of being 5 in. is only 3¹⁄₂ in. In fig. 107 the
link is raised up, so that the rocker-pin is in the centre of it or
midway between the eccentrics. This position is called _mid-gear_. The
successive positions of the centre line of the link in this position
have been laid down in fig. 122 in the same way as was done for full
and half-gear. The movement of the rocker, it will be seen, is, for
mid-gear, only 2¹⁄₂ in. These diagrams show that when the rocker-pin is
opposite the eccentric-rod, the valve receives the full throw of the
eccentric, and that the motion imparted by the eccentric diminishes
as the rocker-pin approaches the centre of the link, so that, with
eccentrics having 5 in. throw and a valve with ⁷⁄₈ lap and ¹⁄₈ in.
lead, we can increase or diminish the travel of the valve from 2¹⁄₂
to 5 in. by simply raising or lowering the link, which is done by the
reverse-lever.

QUESTION 189. _What is the effect of this variation of travel on the
working of the valve and the admission and release of steam to and from
the cylinder?_

_Answer._ It is almost precisely the same as that which is effected
by increasing or diminishing the throw of the eccentric, which was
explained in the answer to Question 52. In order to show this effect
more clearly, we have represented by motion-curves,[51] fig. 123,
the movement imparted to the valve by the link when it is in full,
half and mid-gear, as illustrated in the preceding figures. The curve
for full-gear is engraved in full heavy lines; that for half-gear in
lighter lines, and for mid-gear in dotted lines. From these curves it
will be seen that when the valve is worked in full-gear the steam-port
is opened wide at 2 in. of the stroke and steam cut off at 21 inches.
When the valve is worked in half-gear the port is not at any time
opened wide and steam is then cut off at 17¹⁄₂ in. of the stroke, and
when worked in mid-gear the greatest opening of the steam-port is no
greater than the lead and the cut-off occurs at 4 inches of the stroke.

  [51] The nature of these curves was explained in answer to Question
  44.

It is of course possible to work the link in any intermediate position
between those which we have represented. Usually the reverse-lever is
arranged so that the steam will be cut off at 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, and
20 inches of the stroke.

QUESTION 190. _What is the greatest and the least admission of steam
possible with the ordinary link motion?_

_Answer._ With 24 in. stroke of piston and 5 in. travel and ⁷⁄₈ in.
lap, steam can be admitted as shown by the motion-curves during 21
in. or 87¹⁄₂ per cent. of the stroke, and can be cut off at about 4
in. or 16²⁄₃ per cent. It will be seen, however, that in mid-gear the
motion-curve becomes a straight line, and that the _pre-admission_
of steam, that is the admission of steam before the piston reaches
the end of the stroke, is equal to that admitted after, so that it
is impossible to work the locomotive with the link in that position.
Practically it is found that no useful work can be done with a link
if the steam is cut off at less than six inches, or one-fourth of the
stroke. Even then the opening of the steam-ports is so small that the
steam which enters the cylinders is very much wire-drawn.

QUESTION 191. _How are the curves drawn which represent the motion of
the valve?_

_Answer._ These motion-curves as produced by the link-motion are very
difficult to draw, as the motion of the link is extremely complicated.
It is doubtful, therefore, whether those who have no knowledge of
mechanical drawing will be able to understand the following description
of the method of doing it, which we will try to make as clear as
possible.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 123._

Scale ³⁄₁₆ in. = 1 inch.]

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 124._

Scale ³⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

In the first place, the centre _S_, fig. 124, of the axle, _A_, of
the rocker, and _B_ of the lifting-shaft, must be laid down in their
proper positions. If, now, the valve has ⁷⁄₈ in. lap and ¹⁄₈ lead, the
lower rocker-pin must be one inch ahead of its middle position when
the piston is at the front end of the cylinder, and at the beginning
of the backward stroke. We will, therefore, mark the centre, _a_, of
the rocker-pin in this position. If from the centre of the axle a
circle, _c d e_, be drawn whose diameter is equal to the throw of the
eccentrics, this circle will represent the path in which the centres of
the eccentrics will revolve. If, now, the distance from the centre of
the axle to the centre of the lower rocker-pin, _a_, when the latter
is in its middle position, be taken for a radius,[52] and from the
position of the rocker-pin at the beginning of the stroke as a centre,
the circle representing the path of the eccentrics be intersected at
two points, _c_ and _d_, the points of intersection will represent
the positions of the centres of the forward and backward eccentrics.
Having determined these positions, draw arcs of circles, _f_ and _g_,
from these centres with a radius equal to the distance from the centres
of the eccentrics to the centres of the pins which connect the rods
to the link. It is evident that at the beginning of the stroke the
centres of the pins in the link must each be in one of these arcs.
But the link is suspended by the hanger, _i h_, which oscillates from
the end, _i_, of the lifting-arm, which for any one point of cut-off
is stationary; and therefore the point of suspension of the link must
always be in the arc, _j k_, described from the centre of the pin, _i_,
in the lifting-arm, with a radius equal to the length of the hanger.
There are, therefore, three points in the link, each of which must be
in one of the arcs which have been drawn, and which will determine
the position of the link. This can be done easiest by drawing the
link, _L_, fig. 125, on a stiff piece of paper, _m n_, and cutting off
the back, _p q_, of it through the centres of the pins, _s_ and _t_,
and also cutting out a triangular piece, _u_, the apex of which will
correspond with the centre of the point of suspension, _o_. By placing
this piece of paper on the drawing it can be moved, so that the three
centre points, _s_, _t_ and _o_, will respectively conform with the
arcs, _f g_ and _j k_, fig. 124. In this position the piece of paper
will then be in the position of the link for the point of the stroke
represented. By marking the centres of the link-pins on the arcs _f_
and _g_, and from them as centres, with the length of the rods used to
draw the arcs, two other arcs, _v_, _w_, be drawn intersecting each
other, the point _d_, where they intersect will be the centre from
which the centre line of the link can be drawn with a radius, _l d_,
equal to the distance from the centre of the eccentrics to the centre
of the link. This will give the first position _-o -o_, of the centre
line of the link. As the rocker-pin must always be in the centre of
the link, it is obvious that the point at which the centre-line of the
link intersects the arc in which the rocker-pin oscillates must be the
position of the centre of the rocker-pin. With this determined the
position of the valve can easily be located.

  [52] This is usually the radius of the link but in some cases
  either a longer or shorter radius is taken to draw the link. In the
  following explanation it is assumed that the link is drawn with this
  radius, or from the centre of the axle. Of course if a greater or
  lesser radius is used, due allowance must be made therefor.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 125._

Scale, ³⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

In order to represent the link at any other point of the stroke, say
after the piston has moved four inches, the position of the crank
must first be laid down. To do this, allowance must be made for the
irregularity due to the angularity of the connecting-rod, which was
explained in answer to Question 54. From the centre of the axle, a
circle, _C D_, whose diameter is equal to the stroke of the piston,
is first drawn, which will represent the path of the crank-pin. A
horizontal centre line, _E F_, should also be drawn through the centre
of the axle and the centre of the cylinder. The intersection _o_ of
this line with the path of the crank-pin will be the position of the
latter at the beginning of the stroke. If from this point a distance,
_o o_, be laid off on the centre line equal to the length of the
connecting-rod,[53] it will give the position of the wrist-pin at the
beginning of the stroke, so that from this its successive positions
for each inch of the stroke can be laid off. From its position after
the piston has made say four inches of the stroke as a centre, and the
length of the connecting-rod as a radius, if the path of the crank-pin
be intersected at -4, the point of intersection will represent the
position of the crank-pin at four inches of the stroke. The distance
from _o_ to -4 is equal to 44 degrees of the whole circle. The
eccentrics, being attached to the axle, of course move the same number
of degrees that the crank does, and therefore, in order to determine
their position when the crank has moved any distance, it is only
necessary to move them as many degrees as the crank has. This can
be done very easily by extending the radii of the eccentrics, when
they are in the first position, until they intersect the path of the
crank-pin at _c′_ and _d′_. By stepping off from the latter points of
intersection a distance _c′ c‴_ and _d′ d‴_, equal to _o_ -4, which the
crank has moved, and then drawing other radii from the two points _c‴_,
_d‴_, their intersection, _c″ d″_, with the path of the eccentrics
will represent the position of the centres of the eccentrics when the
crank is at -4. Having determined the position of the eccentrics,
the link can be laid down as before, that is, from _c″_ and _d″_ as
centres and with the length of the eccentric-rods as a radius arcs,
_f″_ and _g″_, are drawn. Then with the paper template the positions of
the centres of the link-pins in these arcs are determined and marked,
and from them with the length of the eccentric rods as a radius, two
intersecting arcs, _v″_, _w″_, are drawn, whose intersection gives
the centre of the link from which its centre line, -4 -4, is drawn.
This will give the position of the rocker-pin for another point of
the stroke. In a similar manner its position can be determined for
any number of points of the stroke, from which the position of the
valve can easily be determined and laid down on the diagram for the
motion-curve as was described in the answer to Question 44. Of course
the valve will be moved from its middle position the same distance
that the rocker-pin is,[54] only in an opposite direction. In order to
lay down the position of the valve on the diagram for motion-curves, it
is, therefore, only necessary to draw it in the same relative position
as that of the rocker-pin which is given by the point of intersection
of the center line of the link with the path in which the rocker-pin
oscillates. To construct the motion-curves it is necessary to determine
the positions of the valve for different points of the stroke and
mark them on the horizontal lines which represent the respective
positions of the piston. Curves are then drawn through these points,
either by hand or by constructing templates. The more points there are
determined, the more accurate will be the curves. It is, therefore,
best to lay down the position of the valve for each inch of the stroke
of the piston. They should also be drawn full size, which of course was
impossible for the illustrations which are given herewith.

  [53] In order to get the engraving within the required limits, the
  diagram is drawn with a connecting-rod only 5¹⁄₂ instead of 7 feet.
  The latter is the length used in previous illustrations.

  [54] This will be the case when the two arms of the rocker are of the
  same length, as they usually are. Sometimes, though rarely, they are
  of different lengths.

QUESTION 192. _Is there any other method of drawing these motion
curves?_

_Answer._ Yes: models which show the working of the valve-gear have
been constructed with a pencil, to which the reciprocating motion of
the valve is imparted, and which traces a curve on a surface having
the same motion as the piston. This method has been employed by the
writer in an instrument which he has applied to the locomotive itself.
The principle upon which it works will be understood by supposing
that the steam and exhaust-ports as represented in the diagram for
motion-curves, fig. 123, be drawn on a board, _A B C D_, fig. 126, but
instead of standing vertical, as in fig. 123, they are represented in a
horizontal position, and the board on which they are drawn is fastened
to the cross-head, _L_, so that the former will move backward and
forward simultaneously with the latter and the piston. A small shaft,
_F_, is attached to suitable supports, _j_, which are fastened to the
guides. This shaft has two arms, _G_ and _E_, one vertical and the
other horizontal and of the same length. The upper end of the vertical
one, _G_, is then attached to the valve-stem or rocker-arm by a short
connecting-rod, _H_, or other suitable means, so that the movement of
the valve-stem will be imparted to the arm and shaft. Of course the end
of the horizontal shaft then has exactly the same motion vertically
that the valve-stem and valve have horizontally, with the very trifling
inaccuracy due to the fact that the movement of the one is in a
straight line, whereas the other is in the arc of a circle.

Now if a pencil, _P_, is attached to the end of the horizontal arm,
_E_, and is set so that its point indicates the exact position of the
steam edge, _h_, of the valve, as shown in fig. 123, it is obvious that
when the piston and board have moved four inches, the pencil will have
moved downward and have drawn the portion of the motion-curve from _h_
to _i_; and when the piston has moved eight inches the curve will be
drawn to _j_, and at 12, 16, 20 and 24 inches of the stroke the curve
will be drawn to _k_, _l_, _m_ and _n_. During the return stroke a
corresponding curve, _n o h_, will, of course, be drawn. With such an
instrument curves can be drawn for any position of the link, and they
will show the exact movement of the valve during the whole stroke,
and will indicate all the defects resulting from bad proportions or
construction, lost motion in the parts, or other causes of error or
irregularity.

[Illustration: Fig. 126.--Scale ³⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

In using this instrument, however, it is impracticable to attach
a board to the inside of the cross-head, and it must therefore be
fastened to the outside. The horizontal arm _E_ should be made of thin
steel, so as to form a spring. The end has a small _boss_[55] with a
hole in it ³⁄₁₆ of an inch in diameter. This hole has a screw thread
cut in it, into which an ordinary hard drawing pencil is screwed. The
spring is so arranged that the pencil will not be in contact with the
board unless it be pressed against it. The locomotive is then placed
on a smooth piece of track with steam on and run very slowly, so that
a person walking alongside can press the pencil against the surface
of the board, which should be covered with drawing paper. By watching
the cross-head when it reaches the end of the stroke, the pencil can
then be pressed against the paper and kept in contact through the whole
stroke and instantly released when the motion-curve is completed. The
link can then be placed in another position, and thus any number of
curves can be drawn, which will furnish the most accurate means of
analyzing the motion of the valve.

  [55] The term “boss” is used to imply an enlargement or increased
  thickness of any part.

In practice it is best not to draw the lines which represent the edges
of the ports, until after the curves are drawn and the paper removed
from the board. A centre line must, however, be drawn on the engine
from which to lay off the ports. This can be done by placing the valve
in its middle position, and then fastening the shaft _F_ in that
position with a nut which should be provided for that purpose on the
end of the shaft. After it is fastened in this position, detach the
connecting-rod _H_, and with one stroke of the piston a centre line can
be drawn with the pencil _P_. From this centre line the edges of the
ports can easily be laid off and drawn on the paper after it is taken
off the engine.

QUESTION 193. _Can the position of each edge of the valve, with any
given amount of travel, be shown in its relation to the ports by one
motion-curve, or is it necessary to draw such curves for each edge of
the valve, as shown in fig. 28?_

_Answer._ One motion-curve is sufficient to represent the position of
any part of the valve during the entire stroke. This will be apparent
if it is remembered that each motion-curve is exactly like the others,
as shown in fig. 28, the only difference being that the ports occupy
different positions in relation to the curves. It is, therefore, only
necessary to draw lines to represent the relative positions of the
ports to the other curves to show the entire motion of the valve by
one curve. To illustrate this it will be assumed that a motion-curve,
_h i j k l m n o p_, and a centre line, _a b_, fig. 127, have been
drawn with the instrument described in the answer to the previous
question. The centre line _a b_, which will be equal in length to the
stroke of the piston, should then be divided into inches, and lines
_ff_, 23 1, 22 2, etc., should be drawn through the points of division
and at right angles to _a b_. If, now, we want to show the movement
of the front steam edge of the valve in relation to the corresponding
steam port, a line, _t_, should be drawn perpendicular to _f f_, to
represent that edge of the valve at the beginning of the stroke. As it
is impossible to determine accurately the position of this steam edge
at the beginning of the stroke from the motion-curve, which is then
_tangent_[56] to the line _f f_, we must lay it off from the centre
line, _a b_. This can readily be done if we remember that if a valve
has ⁷⁄₈ in. lap when it is in the middle position, as shown in fig. 27,
and ¹⁄₁₆ in. lead at the beginning of the stroke, it must have moved
¹⁵⁄₁₆ in. from the middle position at the beginning of the stroke as
shown in fig. 28. The line _t_ must therefore be drawn ¹⁵⁄₁₆ in. from
_a b_ to represent its proper position in relation to the motion-curve,
and as it has ¹⁄₁₆ in. lead, the steam edge, _h h′_, of the steam-port
must be drawn at that distance from _t_. Another line, _m m′_, can then
be drawn to represent the width of the front steam-port, _c c′_. From
these lines the movement of the valve in relation to the front port, _c
c′_, and the admission of steam are shown as clearly as in fig. 28.

  [56] A curve is said to be _tangent_ to another carve or to a
  straight line when the two just touch, but do not intersect or cross
  each other.

If now we want to represent the motion and relative position of the
back steam edge of the valve in relation to its port, it is only
necessary to assume that the line _t_ represents that edge, and that
the curve _h i j k l m n o h_ represents its motion, and to draw the
back steam-port in its proper relation to it. When the valve is in its
middle position, as shown in fig. 27, the outside edge of the port _h_
is ⁷⁄₈ in., or a distance equal to the lap, from the steam edge _q_ of
the valve. As the center line _a b_, fig. 127, represents the middle
position of the edge of the valve, it is only necessary to draw a line,
_n n′_, ⁷⁄₈ in., or the same distance from the centre line _a b_ that
the outer edge of the port _d_ is from _q_ in fig. 28, to represent
this edge of the port in fig. 127, and another _b b′_, at a distance
from the former equal to the width of the port, to represent its inner
edge. A line, _q_, below the line 0 24, will represent the edge of the
valve at the beginning of the forward stroke. The curves in relation to
the port _d_ will then show the motion of the valve in relation to this
port, in the same way that the dotted curve _d f_ does in fig. 28.

[Illustration:

  Fig. 127.

Scale ³⁄₁₆ inch = 1 inch.]

If it is desired to represent the motion of the exhaust edge _h′_, fig.
28, of the valve, it is only necessary to imagine that the line _t_,
fig. 127, represents that edge, and then draw in the port _d_ in the
same relation to it that it bears to the edge _h′_, in fig. 28. This
has been done in dotted lines, _c c′_ and _e e′_, in fig. 127.

If the reader will cut a paper section of a valve like that shown in
fig. 27 and place the different edges, _h_, _i_, _h′_ and _q_, so that
they will successively correspond with the line _t_ in fig. 127, the
diagram will perhaps be more clear. If, for example, the paper section
be placed to the right of the line _t_, so that the edge _h_ will
correspond with _t_, then it will be seen that the port _c_ occupies
the same relation to it that it does in fig. 28. If the valve be placed
to the left, so that the edge _q_ corresponds with _t_, then the port
_d_ will be in the same relation to it that it has in fig. 28. If the
edges _i_ and _h′_ be made to correspond with _t_, then the ports drawn
in dotted lines in fig. 127 will represent the ports _c_ and _d_ in
fig. 28.

The position of the ports in relation to the centre line of the
motion-curve can be determined, if it is kept in mind that the centre
line _a b_, fig. 127, represents the position of the different edges
of the valve when the latter is in the middle of the valve-face as
shown in fig. 27, and that the ports must be on the same side, and the
same distance from the centre line that they are from the edge of the
valve whose motion is represented. Thus if the movement of the steam
edge _h_ in relation to its port, _c_, was represented, the edge of
the latter must be drawn on the motion diagram the same distance from
the centre line that it is from _h_ when the valve is in its middle
position as shown in fig. 27. This distance is of course just equal
to the lap of the valve. If the motion of the exhaust edge _h′_ was
represented in relation to the steam port _d_, then the inside edge
of the latter would be drawn the same distance from the centre line
_a b_ in the diagram that the inner edge of the port is from the edge
_h′_ of the valve, which is equal to the inside lap. The exhaust
port could also be drawn in the same way, but it would be liable to
confuse a diagram made to so small a scale as that which has been
employed for the accompanying illustrations, and it has therefore
been omitted. Diagrams of this kind which are made full size will,
of course, show the movement of the valve more distinctly than is
possible in the space occupied by the illustrations herewith. When
they are made of full size, the lines indicating the ports should be
drawn of different colors, so as to distinguish them from each other
easily. Such diagrams will show the position of the valve in relation
to the ports, and indicate the distribution of the steam during the
whole stroke. It is only necessary to refer the curve to the proper
line to determine the position of the valve in relation to either of
the ports for either the admission or release of the steam. If, for
example, we want to observe how the admission of steam is governed by
the valve, by referring to fig. 127 we see that at the beginning of
the backward stroke the valve has ¹⁄₁₆ inch lead; that at 1³⁄₄ inches
of the stroke the port _c_ is wide open, as shown by the intersection
of the motion-curve with the line _m m′_; that the valve has received
its maximum backward travel at 9 inches of the stroke, and begins to
close the port at 15¹⁄₂ inches, and completely closes it at 21 inches
of the stroke. By referring the motion-curve to the lines _n n′_ and _b
b′_, we see that the valve as shown by the line _q_ at _n′_ again has
¹⁄₁₆ inch lead at the beginning of the forward stroke; that the steam
port is wide open at 1³⁄₈ inches of the stroke; begins to close at
16¹⁄₄ inches, and is completely closed at 21 inches. By referring the
curve to the lines _e e′_ and _c c′_ we see that the front port begins
to open to the exhaust before the piston has completed its forward
stroke and when it has nearly an inch to move, that it is wide open
almost immediately after the piston begins its stroke, does not begin
to close until the piston has moved 19¹⁄₂ inches of its stroke, and is
completely closed at 23 inches of the stroke. By referring the curve to
the lines _d d′_ and _g g′_, almost the same phenomena will be observed
for the forward stroke. In fact from such a diagram the whole motion
of the valve can be studied and analyzed with the greatest accuracy;
and, as has already been shown, the motion imparted to a slide valve
by a link is of so complicated a nature that it is almost or quite
impossible to observe its exact nature without such diagrams.

QUESTION 194. _Can a motion diagram be constructed to represent the
motion of the valve with different amounts of travel?_

_Answer._ Yes; it is only necessary to construct motion-curves for
the same diagram for each distance traveled, and they will show the
movement of the valve for the given amount of travel represented by the
curves. This has been done in fig. 128, which is a reduced copy of a
series of motion-curves taken from a locomotive. From this diagram the
movement of a slide-valve worked by the link-motion can be seen from
the highest to the lowest practicable point of cut-off. For convenience
of reference the curves have been numbered.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 128._

Scale ³⁄₁₆ inch = 1 inch.]

The smallest travel of the valve represented by curve No. 1 is a little
less than 2¹⁄₂ in., and the ports are then opened only about ⁵⁄₁₆
in., and the steam is cut off at 8 in. on the backward and 6³⁄₄ in.
on the forward stroke. The exhaust is opened or the steam is released
during the backward stroke at 17 in., and during the forward stroke at
16⁵⁄₈. When the valve works with its greatest travel, as represented by
curve 8, it travels 5 in., and opens the steam port wide at 3 in. of
the backward stroke and 2¹⁄₄ in. of the forward stroke. The steam is
cut off at 20³⁄₄ and 20¹⁄₂ in., and its release takes place at 23¹⁄₈
in. of each stroke. The following table gives the greatest width of
opening, the point of cut-off, the point of release, and the lead for
each motion-curve on the diagram. This table has been made up from the
motion-curves drawn with the instrument described in answer to Question
191, on a locomotive which had been running about eighteen months and
whose valve-gear consequently was considerably worn, as s indicated
by the flatness of the motion-curves on each side at the point when the
motion of the valve was reversed. This flatness was caused by the lost
motion in the valve-gear, the pencil remaining for a time stationary
when the motion was reversed and while the parts were moving from their
bearings on one side to those on the other. The curves and the table
therefore show the operation not of a theoretically perfect valve-gear,
but are examples of actual practice, with such imperfections as are
incidental to ordinary locomotives. It will be seen that the instrument
shows not only what the valve-gear should, but what it actually does
do, and delineates all its imperfections.

QUESTION 195. _What are the chief dimensions of the valve-gear
represented in fig. 128?_

_Answer._ The throw of eccentrics was 5 in., the steam-ports were 1¹⁄₄
in., and the exhaust-port 2³⁄₄ in. wide, the valve had ⁷⁄₈ in. outside
and ¹⁄₁₆ inside lap and ¹⁄₁₆ in. lead at full stroke.

QUESTION 196. _What relation is there between the distance which the
ports are opened by the valve, and its travel when worked by a link?_

_Answer._ As explained in the answer to Question 52, the width which
the steam-ports are opened by the valve for the admission of steam
diminishes with the travel of the valve. This is shown very clearly by
the motion-curves, and also in the above table, from both of which it
will be seen that when the valve travels only 2¹⁄₂ in. the steam-ports
are opened only ¹¹⁄₃₂ in. for the back stroke and ⁵⁄₁₆ for the front.
With 2⁵⁄₈ travel the opening is ⁷⁄₁₆ and ¹³⁄₃₂ in. With 4 in. travel
the port is opened 1¹⁄₈ and 1³⁄₃₂ in. and with 4¹⁄₄ in. travel they
would be opened wide. With 4¹⁄₂ and 5 in. travel, as will be seen from
the motion diagram, the ports are not only opened wide, but the valve
throws “over” them, or travels beyond their inner edges.

QUESTION 197. _How is the point of cut-off affected by the link?_

_Answer._ Changing the travel of a valve with a link has a very similar
effect to that produced by eccentrics of different throw--that is, the
period of admission is increased with the throw of the eccentric and
that for expansion lessened. This is shown clearly in both the motion
diagram and the table. With the first curve and a travel of 2¹⁄₂ in.
the steam is cut off at 8 in. for the backward stroke and 6³⁄₄ in. for
the front, and with 5 in. travel steam is admitted during 20⁵⁄₈ in. of
the backward and 20¹⁄₂ in. of the forward stroke.

QUESTION 198. _How is the point of release or exhaust of the steam
affected by the link?_

_Answer._ As the travel increases, it is delayed until later in the
stroke. Thus, with 2¹⁄₂ in. travel the steam is exhausted or released
from the cylinder during the backward stroke when the piston has moved
17 in., and on the return stroke at 16⁵⁄₈ in., whereas, with 5 in.
travel of the valve, the release is delayed until 23¹⁄₈ in. of the
stroke. An examination of the diagram and table will show very clearly
the relation of the point of release to the travel.

QUESTION 199. _How is the lead affected by the ordinary link motion?_

_Answer._ It is increased as the travel is diminished, as is shown in
the table, and also by the inclination of the curves at the top and
bottom of the diagram.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 129._

  _Fig. 130._

  _Fig. 131._

Scale ³⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 200. _What is the cause of this change of the amount of lead?_

_Answer._ This can be best explained by reference to fig. 129, which
represents a link with very short eccentric rods. If now the centre
from which the link was drawn was in the centre of the axle _S_, and
the eccentric straps embraced the axle instead of the eccentrics, their
ends _c_ and _d_ would each describe the same arc, _a b_, parallel
with the centre line, _x y_, of the link, and the latter could then
obviously be raised and lowered without moving the rocker-pin at all.
But the eccentric straps being attached to the eccentrics, as shown by
the dotted lines, when the rods are raised or lowered they describe
arcs, _c e_ and _g h_, from the centres _s_ and _t_ of the eccentrics,
and not from the centre of the axle. When the link is raised then, the
end of the upper rod obviously moves in the arc _c e_, and the top
of the link is moved from the axle, as shown in fig. 130, a distance
equal to the interval between the arc, _a b_, drawn from the centre
of the axle, and _e f_, which the rod describes from the centre
of its eccentric. When the link is lowered from back to mid-gear, a
similar action takes place, as the end, _d_, fig. 130, of the lower
rod describes an arc, _f g_, so that the whole link is thrown from the
axle a distance equal to the space between the arcs described from the
centre of the axle and the centres of the eccentrics. When the position
of the eccentrics is reversed, as shown in fig. 131, the link is moved
towards the axle, thus causing an increase of lead on the opposite
side of the valve. We have employed for our illustrations very short
eccentric rods, in order to make this action apparent by exaggerating
it. It is obvious from the engravings that the difference in the lead
is increased as the eccentric rods are shortened, and also as the
distance between the points of connection of the rods with the link
is increased. It will also be plain that increasing the throw of the
eccentrics, that is, increasing the distance of the centres _s_, _s_,
of the eccentrics from the centre _S_ of the axle will also increase
the variation in the lead in full and mid-gear.

QUESTION 201. _What is meant by the distribution of steam in the
cylinder?_

_Answer._ It means the admission and exhaust of steam to and from the
cylinder in relation to the stroke of the piston or the revolution of
the crank.

QUESTION 202. _What are the principal periods or elements of the
distribution of steam by the slide-valve and link motion?_

_Answer._ They are:

1. The _pre-admission_ or lead, that is, the admission of steam into
the cylinders in front of the piston before it has completed its
stroke.

2. The _admission_ of steam after the piston has commenced its stroke.

3. The _expansion_ of steam in the cylinder.

4. The _pre-release_, or exhaust of steam before the piston has
completed its stroke.

5. The _release_, or exhaust during the return stroke of the piston.

6. The _compression_ of steam, or closing the exhaust before the piston
has completed its return stroke.

QUESTION 203. _What is meant by the clearance of the piston?_

_Answer._ It is the space between the piston and the cylinder-head
when the former is at the end of the stroke. If the piston touched the
cylinder-head at the end of each stroke, it would cause a concussion
or “thump” which would injure these parts. Owing to the impossibility
of constructing machinery with absolute accuracy, it is therefore
necessary to leave a space, usually from ¹⁄₂ to ¹⁄₄ in. wide, between
the piston and the cylinder-heads, so as to be certain that they will
not strike each other should there be any slight inaccuracies in the
length of the piston-rods, connecting-rods, frames or other parts.

QUESTION 204. _Why is it desirable to open the steam-port and admit
steam at the end of the cylinder towards which the piston is moving
BEFORE the latter has completed its stroke?_

_Answer._ Because it is essential, in order to insure a good action of
the steam, that the maximum cylinder pressure should be attained at the
very commencement of the stroke. If the steam-port was not opened until
after the piston had commenced its stroke, some appreciable time would
be consumed in filling the clearance space and the _steam-way_ with
steam.[57] It is also found, especially if an engine is working at a
high speed, that a slide-valve worked by the ordinary link-motion will
not open the steam-port rapidly enough to enable steam of the maximum
boiler pressure to fill the space after the receding piston, unless the
valve begins to open the port _before_ the piston reaches the end of
its stroke.

  [57] The _steam-ways_ are the passages which lead from the
  steam-chest to the cylinder, and are sometimes called steam-ports,
  but the term steam-ways is used to distinguish the passages from
  their openings in the valve-seat, which latter are more properly
  called steam-ports.

Another advantage resulting from the pre-admission of steam consists in
the smooth working of the engine at high speeds, a circumstance which
reduces greatly the wear and tear of the working gear. As the piston
approaches the end of its stroke, the pre-admitted steam forms a kind
of elastic cushion, which is well calculated to absorb the momentum
of the reciprocating parts at that instant. The pressure due to the
momentum of these parts will, of course, depend upon their weight and
the speed of working, increasing directly as the square of the speed.
It follows from this that the lead should increase with the speed, and
that it should be greatest at high speeds. As has been shown before,
this condition is fully accomplished by the ordinary shifting-link
motion.

QUESTION 205. _Upon what does the admission of steam into the cylinder
depend?_

_Answer._ It depends in the first place upon the opening of the
throttle-valve, and the size of the pipes and passages through which it
is conveyed from the boiler to the cylinder. In the second place, it
depends upon the time and amount of opening of the steam-port by the
valve.

QUESTION 206. _What should be the pressure of the steam in the cylinder
during admission?_

_Answer._ In order that the steam may be used to most advantage, it
should be admitted and maintained in the cylinder at full boiler
pressure during the whole period of admission. If the opening of
either the throttle-valve or the steam-ports is not sufficient to
allow the steam to flow into the cylinder at full boiler pressure, the
steam is said to be wire-drawn, and much of the advantage of using it
expansively as has already been explained in answer to Question 59, is
then lost.

QUESTION 207. _Why is it difficult to admit and maintain steam at the
full boiler pressure in the cylinder during admission?_

_Answer._ Because it is necessary to reduce the travel of the
slide-valve in order to cut off the steam “_short_,” or soon after the
beginning of the stroke of the piston. When the travel is reduced, the
valve opens the port only a small distance, so that the area of the
opening is not then sufficient to allow the steam to flow into the
cylinder with sufficient rapidity to fill it at full boiler pressure,
especially if the engine is working at a high speed. Thus, by referring
to the table given on page 216 and to the motion curves in fig. 128, it
will be seen that when the steam is cut off at from ¹⁄₄ to ¹⁄₂ stroke,
the port is opened for the admission of steam only from ¹⁄₄ to ¹⁄₂ inch
wide. From the curves it will also be seen that the valve then acquires
its maximum travel and the steam-port its greatest width of opening
very soon after the piston begins its stroke; after which the port is
gradually closed, so that before the steam is entirely cut off the
opening is so much reduced in area that the steam cannot flow through
it rapidly enough to maintain the steam at full boiler pressure in the
cylinder when the engine is working at high speeds.

QUESTION 208. _What means are used to overcome this difficulty and
thus admit steam at full boiler pressure when the valve is cutting off
short?_

_Answer._ In the first place, the steam-ports are made from ten to
twelve times as long as they are wide, so that a narrow opening will
have a comparatively large area. In the second place, by giving the
valve lead, not only are the clearance space and the steam-way filled
with steam when the piston begins its stroke, but the port is then
open a distance equal to the lead. With the ordinary link motion, as
has already been shown, this lead increases as the travel and period
of admission diminish, so that the smaller the total distance that
the port is opened, the greater is its opening at the beginning of
the stroke. As the steam is usually cut off short when locomotives
run at high speeds, it will be seen that the increased lead which is
imparted to the valve by the shifting link is an advantage rather than
a disadvantage. But while it is often possible in this way to secure
a pressure of steam in the cylinder at the beginning of the stroke
equal or nearly so to that in the boiler, yet it is almost impossible
to maintain this pressure during the whole period of admission, when
the steam is cut off short and the engine working at a high speed. To
obviate this evil what is called the Allen valve was designed, which
is represented in fig. 132. This valve has a channel or supplementary
port, _a a_, which passes over the exhaust cavity, and has two
openings, _b_, _b′_, in the valve-face. When the valve begins to admit
or “_take_” steam at _c_, as shown in fig. 133, it will be seen that it
also uncovers the opening _b′_ at _e_ and admits steam at _b′_, which
passes through the channel _b′ a a b_ and enters the steam-port _c_
at _b_, and in this way there is a double opening for the admission
of steam. The opening _b_ of the supplementary port is closed as the
valve advances, but when this takes place the steam-port is uncovered
far enough to admit all the steam that is required. This form of valve
is very efficient when the travel and point of cut-off are very short.
It then gives just twice as much opening as the ordinary valve for the
admission of steam. This improved valve has been much used in Europe;
but, although it is an American invention, has not received the
attention in this country which its merit deserves.

Scale ³⁄₁₆ in. = 1 inch.]

QUESTION 209. _What is meant by the pre-release of steam?_

_Answer._ It is the release of the steam before the piston has
completed its stroke. If it is confined until the piston has reached
the end of the cylinder, there will not be time nor will it be
possible, with a slide valve and link-motion, to secure a sufficiently
large opening of the port to permit the steam to escape from the
cylinder before the piston begins its return stroke. If there were no
pre-release, there would therefore be more or less back pressure on the
piston.

QUESTION 210. _Upon what does the amount of pre-release depend?_

_Answer._ First, as has already been explained in answer to Question
51, on the amount of inside lap; and second, on the outside lap of
the valve and lead of the eccentrics; and third, on the travel of
the valve. The less the inside lap, the greater the outside lap and
consequent lead of the eccentrics; and the shorter the travel of the
valve, the earlier will be the release. The proper amount of this
pre-release depends upon the velocity of the piston and the quantity
of steam to be discharged or the degree of expansion. From the
motion-curves in fig. 128 it will be seen that it is a marked feature
of the shifting-link motion that the pre-release occurs earlier in the
stroke as the link approaches mid-gear, or as the travel of the valve
diminishes. As the link is usually worked near that position when the
engine is run at a high speed, it will be seen that in this respect
again the link-motion is well adapted for working the slide-valves of
locomotives.

QUESTION 211. _What governs the period of release?_

_Answer._ The release like pre-release is dependent upon the amount of
inside lap, the outside lap and consequent lead of the eccentrics, and
the travel of the valve.

The addition of inside lap has the effect of closing the port earlier
than it would be closed without, and thus shortening the period of
release and also of reducing the area of the opening of the port. This
will be apparent by referring to fig. 128, in which the valve had ¹⁄₁₆
in. lead. The dotted lines which represent the edges of the ports in
relation to the exhaust edges of the valve are therefore drawn ¹⁄₁₆ in.
from the centre line _a b_. If, however, there had been no inside lap,
then the edges of the ports would have conformed to the line _a b_. It
will be observed that the first curve crosses the dotted line _g g′_
at 15¹⁄₂ in. of the forward stroke, which is the point at which the
port is closed to the exhaust, or where the period of release ends and
compression begins. If there had been no lap and the line _g g′_ had
therefore occupied the same position as _a b_, then the motion-curve
would not have crossed it until the piston had reached 16 in. of its
stroke, thus showing that the period of release had been lengthened
and compression delayed. As the width of the opening of the port is
represented by the distance of the motion-curve from the right hand
side of the line _g g′_, which represents the edge of the port, it is
obvious that if there had been no lap, so that the position of the line
representing the edge of the port had occupied the position of _a b_,
then the space between it and the motion-curve would have been greater,
thus showing that the port would have been opened wider if there had
been no inside lap. The width of the opening of the port to the exhaust
is in fact always diminished by an amount equal to the inside lap.

With the same travel, increase of outside lap and lead shortens the
period of release, but has no effect on the width of the opening of the
port to the exhaust.

Increase of travel, with the same outside lap, lengthens the period of
release and also increases the width of the opening of the port to the
exhaust.

QUESTION 212. _What governs the period of compression?_

_Answer._ As compression begins when release ends, or when the port is
closed to the exhaust, it is controlled by exactly the same causes, and
as the two events occur simultaneously, of course whatever shortens the
period of release lengthens that of compression.

QUESTION 213. _What effect do the clearance spaces and steam-ways have
upon the compression of the confined steam?_

_Answer._ By referring to the motion-curves in fig. 128, it will be
seen that the steam-port is closed by the exhaust edge of the valve,
or compression begins some time before the piston reaches the end of
the stroke. The result is that the remaining portion of the cylinder,
through which the piston must move _after_ the port is closed to the
exhaust, is filled with steam of atmospheric pressure, or possibly
a little above that pressure. As this is confined in the cylinder,
it is compressed by the advance of the piston. If there was no room
between it and the cylinder at the end of the stroke, then either the
cylinder would be burst or the valve would lift so as to allow the
compressed steam to flow back into the steam-chest. The clearance and
the steam-passages, however, afford considerable room, into which
the confined steam can be compressed without danger of bursting the
cylinder, or of raising the slide-valve when there is steam in the
steam-chest. As the clearance spaces and steam-ways must be filled
with high-pressure steam at the beginning of each stroke, it must be
obtained either by taking a supply of “_live_”[58] steam from the
boiler, or by compressing into the clearance spaces the low-pressure
steam that still remained in the cylinder when the port was closed to
the exhaust. By the latter process, a certain quantity of steam is
saved at the expense of increased back pressure. It should be borne in
mind also that the total heat of the compressed steam increases with
its pressure, and as this latter approaches that in the boiler, the
temperature of the former must have been raised from that due to about
atmospheric pressure to nearer the temperature of that in the boiler.
These changes of temperature which the steam undergoes will affect
the surface of the metal with which the steam is in contact during
the period of compression; it follows from this, that the ends of the
cylinder principally comprising the clearance spaces must acquire a
higher temperature than those parts where expansion only takes place.
This is an important consideration, since the fresh steam from the
boiler comes first in contact with these spaces, and by touching
surfaces which have thus previously been heated, as it were, by the
high temperature of the compressed steam, less heat will be abstracted
from the fresh steam, and therefore a less amount of water will be
deposited in the cylinder.[59]

  [58] The term “live” steam means steam taken direct from the boiler
  and which has not been used in the cylinder or to do any work.

  [59] Bauschinger’s Indicator Experiments on Locomotives, published in
  Vol. III. of the RAILROAD GAZETTE.

It will thus be seen that the effect of compression is to fill
the clearance spaces and steam-ways with compressed steam before
pre-admission begins. As already stated, this is done at the expense
of back pressure in the cylinder. It must be remembered that all
the energy, excepting that part which is wasted by loss of heat,
friction, etc., which is consumed in compressing the confined steam,
is again given out to the piston by expansion. The confined steam
also acts as an elastic cushion to receive the piston, just as the
steam which is admitted before the end of the stroke would if there
were no compression. Compression, therefore, has the effect of saving
the quantity of live steam which it would otherwise be necessary to
admit before the end of the stroke to fill the clearance spaces and
steam-ways and also to “cushion” the piston. As already stated, the
momentum of the piston and other parts depends upon their weight
and the speed at which they are working, increasing directly as the
square of the speed, from which it follows that the compression should
increase rapidly with the speed, and should be the greatest at high
speeds. As the ports are prematurely closed to the exhaust with the
shifting-link motion, and as the lead increases rapidly as the link
approaches mid-gear, and the amount of compression is at the same time
correspondingly augmented, it will be seen that the shifting-link
motion fulfills these conditions very perfectly.

The pressure to which the confined steam will rise depends of course
upon the amount of the period of compression, and also on the size
of the clearance spaces. As it is possible to have such an amount of
compression that it will exceed the boiler pressure, and thus raise
the valve from its seat and be forced back into the steam-chest, some
care must be exercised to proportion the one to the other, so that the
degree of the confined steam may not be excessive.

QUESTION 214. _How can the effect of the distribution of the steam upon
its action in the cylinder be determined by experiment?_

_Answer._ As already explained in answer to Question 55, this can be
done by an instrument called a steam indicator.

[Illustration: Fig. 134.]

[Illustration: Fig. 135.

Scale 3 in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 215. _What is the construction of this instrument?_

_Answer._ The indicator now ordinarily used is the Richards indicator,
the outside of which is represented in fig. 134 and a section in fig.
135. It consists of a cylinder, _B_, into which a piston, _C_, is
accurately fitted, but so that it will move freely in the cylinder.
The piston rod is surrounded with a spiral spring, _D_, the lower
end of which is attached to the top of the piston, and the upper end
to the cylinder cover. When steam is introduced below the piston it
pushes it up in the cylinder and the spring is compressed. If there
should be a vacuum below the piston, the air above it will press the
piston downward and extend the spring. This latter occurs only when
the indicator is used on condensing engines. Of course the distance
which the piston is forced up by the steam pressure below it depends
upon the amount of pressure and also on the tension of the spring; and
therefore by attaching a pencil to the piston-rod so that it can mark
on a moving card in front of it, a diagram will be drawn which would
indicate the steam pressure, as was explained in answer to Question 55.
But there are some practical difficulties in the way of doing this.
It is found that if the pencil is attached directly to the piston-rod
of the indicator, the distance through which they must move, in order
to make the scale of the diagram sufficiently large to be clear, is
so great that the momentum of the parts carries them further than the
pressure of the steam alone would move them. The distance through
which the pistons or instruments move, moreover, makes it impossible
that the changes of pressure should be indicated simultaneously with
the position of the piston; the latter must travel while the action
is taking place, and thus the diagram shows changes of pressure later
or more gradually than they occur.[60] To overcome these and other
difficulties, the piston-rod of the indicator which we have illustrated
is attached at _h_ to the short arm of a lever, _F G_, and to the end
of the long arm a piece, _F I_, is attached, which carries a pencil,
_J_. By this means the piston has only one-fourth of the motion that
it imparts to the pencil, so that the momentum of the moving parts is
comparatively slight. If the pencil was attached directly to the end of
the lever, it is obvious that it would move in the arc of a circle, and
that this would be a source of error in the diagram. To avoid this the
pencil is attached to what is called a “parallel motion.” This consists
of a coupling-rod, _F I_, which connects the ends of two levers, _F
G_ and _I H_. The centre of the rod _F I_, to which the pencil is
attached, will with this arrangement move in a straight line. The
levers and all the parts are of course all made as light as possible,
so that their weight will have little effect on the motion of the
indicator piston.

  [60] Richards’ Steam Indicator, by Charles T. Porter.

The paper or card on which the diagram is drawn is wrapped around a
brass cylinder, _A A_. This cylinder is made to revolve part of the
way around by a strong twine, _a b_, which is wrapped around a pulley,
_b_, at the bottom of the cylinder. The twine is attached to a lever,
similar to that shown in fig. 30, which receives a reciprocating
motion from the piston of the engine. The twine can of course move
the cylinder only in one direction, and therefore a coiled spring
similar to a clock spring is placed inside of the cylinder to draw it
back when the twine is relaxed. In this way the paper cylinder or drum
receives a part of a revolution at each stroke of the piston, and moves
simultaneously with it. This drum is used instead of a flat card, on
account of the practical difficulties of employing the latter. The
motion of the paper on this drum will, however, be exactly the same in
relation to the pencil as the motion of a flat card would be.

[Illustration: Fig. 136a.]

The method of attaching an indicator to a locomotive is represented in
fig. 136a. It will be seen from this that it is placed over the center
of the steam chest and connected to each end of the cylinder with
³⁄₄-inch pipes. A globe valve was in the case represented placed on
each side of the indicator, so that it could be put into communication
with either end of the cylinder, or could be completely shut off from
both. A better plan, however, is to have a three-way cock at the point
where the horizontal pipe connects with the vertical one leading to the
indicator, as the passages in a three-way cock are more direct than
those in globe valves. The arrangement of the levers for giving motion
to the indicator drum, and of the seat, which is very requisite for the
experimenter, will be readily understood from the engraving without
further explanation. It is thought by some engineers that the indicator
should be applied as near to each end of the cylinder as possible. It
is believed, however, that if the pipes, cocks, and their connections
are made large enough so as not to impede the motion of the steam, no
appreciable error will arise from the method illustrated in fig. 136a.

QUESTION 216. _What should be the form of an indicator diagram, if
the steam is distributed by a link motion so as to produce the best
practicable action in the cylinders?_

_Answer._ It should approximate to that shown in fig. 136b. In this
diagram the vertical lines represent inches of the stroke, and the
scale on the left the steam pressure in pounds per square inch. The
atmospheric and vacuum lines are also indicated, as already explained
in answer to Question 55. The points at which the different periods
of the distribution begin are indicated by the letters _a_, _b_, _c_,
_d_, _e_ and _f_. These are in the order in which they occur: _a_,
pre-admission; _b_, admission; _c_, expansion; _d_, pre-release; _e_,
release; and _f_, compression. The lines forming the outline of the
diagram will be designated for convenience of description as follows:

  The line from _a_ to _b_, the _admission line_.
  The line from _b_ to _c_, the _steam line_.
  The line from _c_ to _d_, the _line or curve of expansion_.
  The line from _d_ to _e_, the _exhaust line_.
  The line from _e_ to _f_, the _line of back pressure_.
  The line from _f_ to _a_, the _line or curve of compression_.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 136b._]

The diagram represents a distribution of steam produced by a valve
having ⁷⁄₈ in. outside and ¹⁄₁₆ inside lap, and operated by the link
motion represented in fig. 103. The eccentrics have 5 in. throw, and
the steam-ports are 1¹⁄₄ and the exhaust 2³⁄₄ in. wide. The valve as
shown by the diagram is cutting off at 8 in., or one-third of the
stroke. Pre-admission begins when the piston still has ¹⁄₂ in. to move
before reaching the end of its stroke. Admission of course begins with
the stroke, expansion at 8 in., pre-release at 18¹⁄₂ in., release
at the end of the stroke, and compression at 17¹⁄₂ in. of the return
stroke. The valve is supposed to be set without any lead, or “_line
and line_,”[61] as it is called at full stroke. When the steam is cut
off at 8 in. of the stroke, the valve has 2⁵⁄₈ in. travel and ³⁄₁₆ in.
lead. The steam pressure in the boiler is supposed to be 100 pounds
above the atmosphere. Of course, when the valve cuts off at different
points of the stroke, the periods of distribution will be somewhat
changed; but from the above diagram the principal features of a good
distribution can be explained.

  [61] That is, the steam edges of the valve correspond with the steam
  edges of the port at the beginning of the stroke.

These are: First, that the steam pressure should rise rapidly during
the period of pre-admission, so that there will be full boiler pressure
in the cylinder at the beginning of the stroke. When this occurs, the
pre-admission line will rise from _a_ to _b_, to such a point at _b_
which will indicate full boiler pressure in the cylinder. The same
pressure should then be maintained in the cylinder during the whole
period of admission, and the admission line from _b_ to _c_ should
therefore be a straight horizontal line, as shown in fig. 136b. When
expansion begins, the pressure will fall, as was explained in answer
to Question 55. The expansion line should approximate a hyperbolic
curve, but if there is much loss of heat by radiation or other causes,
the diagram will fall considerably below the theoretical curve. With
cylinders well protected and with dry steam the expansion line will
fall slightly below a hyperbolic curve at the beginning of the period
of expansion, and rise above it during the latter part of the same
period. The reason of this is that the cylinder is heated by the
admission of live steam of comparatively high pressure and temperature,
so that, when the pressure becomes reduced by expansion, a part of
the water which is condensed in the cylinder will be re-evaporated by
the heat in the latter. From the point of the pre-release, _d_, to
the end of the stroke, _e_, the exhaust line should fall rapidly, so
that there will be no pressure behind the piston during its return
stroke. To explain the theoretical form of the exhaust line would
lead us into a very abstruse discussion, which would be out of place
here. It will be sufficient for our purpose to call attention to the
fact that the pre-release should allow all the steam in the cylinder
to escape before the piston reaches the end of the stroke, so that
the back pressure during the return stroke may be as low as possible.
It is, however, only at comparatively slow speeds that the steam in
locomotive cylinders escapes during the period of pre-release, so that
the back pressure is reduced to that of the atmosphere. It is necessary
in locomotives, as has already been explained, to contract the area
of the blast orifices or exhaust nozzles, in order to stimulate the
draft through the fire, so that the steam cannot escape with sufficient
rapidity to reduce the back pressure to that of the atmosphere if the
engine is running fast. Of course every pound of back pressure on
the piston is so much loss of energy, and a reduction of the amount
of work done by the engine; but it is a sacrifice which must be made
in order to be able to generate the requisite quantity of steam. In
studying the distribution of steam, however, every effort should be
made to reduce the back pressure as much as is practicable, and yet
maintain a sufficient supply of steam, and therefore the line of back
pressure should conform as closely as possible to the atmospheric
line. The compression line should be a hyperbolic curve, beginning
with the period of compression. In calculating both the compression
and expansion, allowance must be made for the clearance space and
steam-way. In a cylinder like that illustrated in fig. 92, their
contents would be about equal to that of two inches of the cylinder.
Therefore, when steam is cut off at 8 in. of the stroke, instead of
having a quantity of steam which will fill a cylinder 16 in. diameter
and 8 in. long, we have as much as would fill a cylinder of that
diameter and 10 in. long. The same thing is true of the compression.
This must occur in the above example when the piston has 6¹⁄₂ in. more
to move before completing its stroke. There is therefore a quantity
of steam in front of it sufficient to fill a cylinder 8¹⁄₂ in. in
diameter. This steam is of course compressed by the advance of the
piston, and if its pressure when compression begins is the same as
that of the atmosphere, then it will be 0.9 lbs. above it when the
piston has only 6 in. to move and 3.2, 6.2, 10.5, 16.9, and 27.5
lbs. effective pressure when the piston has 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 inches
to move respectively, and when pre-admission begins, the pressure
will have risen to 48.7 lbs. If the back pressure is above that of
the atmosphere, of course the compression will be correspondingly
increased. It will also be seen that, without any or with very little
clearance space, the compression would at the end of each stroke rise
above the boiler pressure. It being a peculiarity of the ordinary
shifting-link motion that as the period of admission is reduced that of
compression is lengthened, the latter becomes very excessive when the
steam is cut off at less than one-third or one-fourth of the stroke.

QUESTION 217. _In what respect would a diagram made by an indicator
differ from the theoretical form represented in fig. 136b?_

_Answer._ It would be drawn with less exactness; that is, the corners
instead of being sharply defined, as in fig. 136b, would be more or
less rounded, as in fig. 137, and the curves and straight lines would
vary somewhat from the exact mathematical form indicated in fig. 136b.
The higher the speed at which the engine is working when the diagrams
are taken, the greater will be the variation from the theoretical form.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 137._]

QUESTION 218. _If the amount of pre-admission is insufficient, how will
it be shown in the indicator diagram?_

_Answer._ The effect of too little pre-admission is to lower the
pressure of the steam at the beginning of the stroke, and at high
speeds there will not be time enough nor sufficient opening of the
steam-port to supply the deficiency after the stroke has commenced.
The corner of the diagram at _b_ will then be very much rounded, as
shown in fig. 138. This is apt to be the case when steam is admitted
during a considerable part of the stroke, as a shifting-link motion
then gives less lead than when it is worked nearer mid-gear. If the
steam is cut off short, then the pressure in the cylinder during
admission is very much below boiler pressure, and is apt to fall
rapidly after the commencement of the stroke, as shown in fig. 138.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 138._]

QUESTION 219. _If the opening of the steam-ports during admission is
too small, what will be the form of the diagram?_

_Answer._ The effect will be very much the same as that produced by too
little pre-admission or lead; that is, the pressure in the cylinder
will be much lower than in the boiler and will fall rapidly during the
periods of admission, as shown in fig. 138.

QUESTION 220. _What defects will be indicated by the expansion curve of
indicator diagrams?_

_Answer._ If the cylinders are not well protected, and there is much
loss of heat from radiation, there will be a rapid fall of pressure
during the period of expansion, which will be shown by the expansion
curve falling below the theoretical curve shown in fig. 136b. If, on
the contrary, the indicator curve is much above the theoretical curve,
it may be caused by a leak in the valve. As steam is quite as likely
to leak from the steam-port into the exhaust as from the steam-chest
into the steam-port, a valve which is not tight may produce just the
contrary effect upon the indicator diagram. As it is usually quite easy
to detect a leak in the valve by other means, the use of the indicator
for this purpose is unnecessary. Attention is called to it, however,
to show the impossibility of getting results of any value with the
indicator if the valves are not steam-tight.

QUESTION 221. _What should be observed regarding the exhaust line of
the indicator diagram?_

_Answer._ The most important point to be observed is, whether the
pressure at the end of the stroke is reduced as low as possible, as at
high speeds it is usually much more difficult to exhaust the steam from
than to admit it into the cylinder. As already stated, the blast in the
chimney makes it almost impossible to exhaust the steam to atmospheric
pressure when the locomotive is running fast. If the steam is released
too late in the stroke, as already explained, there will not be time
enough nor sufficient opening of the port to allow the confined steam
to escape from the cylinder before the end of the stroke, and this
will be indicated on the diagram by the space between the line of back
pressure and the atmospheric line during the commencement of the return
stroke, as shown in fig. 138.

QUESTION 222. _What should be observed regarding the line of back
pressure?_

_Answer._ The most important point is, that it should approximate as
closely as possible to the atmospheric line, as all the back pressure
not only diminishes the efficiency of the engine, but is a total
loss of energy. Too much inside lap will increase the amount of back
pressure, but generally it is more influenced by the area of the
blast orifices than by any other cause. Every effort should be made,
therefore, to have them as large as possible and yet have the boiler
make as much steam as is needed.

When only one blast orifice is used for both cylinders, it often
happens that when the steam is exhausted from the one cylinder it
“blows” over into the other, and thus produces an additional amount of
back pressure. This is shown by a rise or “hump” in the line of back
pressure, as indicated in fig. 138.

QUESTION 223. _Can the amount of compression which is needed be
determined by calculation?_

_Answer._ Yes; but it involves more abstruse principles of mathematics
than it is thought best to introduce here. Some of the reasons can,
however, be given, which will make the subject clearer, and enable the
reader, if he has sufficient knowledge of mathematics, to investigate
the subject still further.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 140._]

In the first place it is a well-known fact that the motion of a piston
in the cylinder of a steam engine is not a uniform one, but increases
in speed from the beginning of the stroke to the middle, and diminishes
in speed from the middle to the opposite end. The cause of this is that
the crank revolves at a uniform speed during the entire revolution,
but the piston moves much less at the beginning of the stroke, with a
given amount of revolution of the crank, than it does at the middle.
This is shown in fig. 140, in which _A_ is a cylinder and _B_ the
piston and _a b c d_ the path of the crank. Now while the crank moves
from _a_ to 1, or ¹⁄₁₂ of a revolution, the piston has moved 1³⁄₈
in., or a distance equal to that from _a_ to 1′ or to the base of a
perpendicular drawn from 1 to the centre line _a c_. While the crank
moves from 1 to 2, or through the second twelfth of a revolution, the
piston has moved from 1′ to 2′, or 4³⁄₈ in., or 2³⁄₄ in. further than
during the first twelfth of the crank’s revolution. During the third
twelfth of the revolution the piston moves from 2′ to 3′, or 6 in.,
thus showing that it continues to increase in the distance moved during
each period of the revolution of the crank until the latter has made
a quarter revolution. The speed of the piston then begins to diminish
until it reaches the end of the stroke. It is slightly affected by the
angularity of the connecting-rod, as already explained, but for the
present this is disregarded. It is obvious now that if the momentum,
or actual energy stored up in the piston and other reciprocating parts
after they have passed the middle of the stroke, added to the pressure
behind the piston, is greater than the resistance offered by the crank,
the motion of the latter will then be accelerated and thus conveyed
to the moving engine and train. If, however, there is any momentum in
the piston when it reaches the end of the stroke, evidently it can
exert no power to cause the crank to revolve, but must be expended by
producing a pressure on the crank-pin and thus on the axle-boxes. Not
only will such a pressure not cause the crank to revolve, but it
will be more difficult to turn the crank with such a pressure against
it than it would be without. The momentum of the piston and other
reciprocating parts at the dead point therefore creates a resistance
to the movement of the crank instead of helping to turn it. It will
also be observed that after the crank has moved slightly from the dead
point, any pressure on the piston will exert very little force which
will tend to turn the crank. In fact the nearer the piston is to the
end of the stroke the greater is the proportion which the friction
of the crank-pin and axle bears to the useful effect of the strain
in causing the crank to turn. Calculation shows that for about three
degrees on either side of the dead points the effect of pressure on the
crank-pin is actually to retard the engine. If now the piston reaches
the end of the stroke with a certain amount of unexpended momentum
stored up in it, if this energy is expended by producing pressure on
the crank, then it will not only be a waste of energy but a double
waste by retarding the motion of the crank. If, however, this energy
can be absorbed by compressing steam which will fill the clearance
spaces, it will not only prevent the retarding effect referred to,
but the energy in the piston and other parts will be converted into
steam pressure, which will be given out in useful work during the next
stroke. It would, of course, be impossible to arrest the motion of the
piston instantly, and therefore its momentum is gradually absorbed from
the time compression begins until it reaches the end of the stroke. As
the energy of a moving body is equal to its weight multiplied by the
square of its speed, it is obvious that to overcome this a different
amount of compression would be required for each speed, and also that
it must be adjusted to the weight of the moving parts. Such exact
adaptation is not practicable on locomotives, nor does the link motion
enable us to alter the amount of compression with so much exactness:
but the explanation shows the value of increasing the amount of
compression with the speed, which fortunately the peculiarities of the
shifting-link motion enable us to do without difficulty.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 139._]

QUESTION 224. _What cause produces the form of diagram represented by
Fig. 139?_

_Answer._ It is produced by excessive compression, which causes
the pressure in the cylinder to rise above boiler pressure before
pre-admission begins. As soon as the port is opened, part of the steam
in the cylinder flows back into the steam-chest, and thus the pressure
is reduced, as shown by the diagram.

QUESTION 225. _How can we determine whether the steam is distributed in
the cylinders to the best advantage, and how can we discover the fault,
if there is one, in the link motion?_

_Answer._ The indicator will show the action of the steam in the
cylinder, and motion-curves drawn with the instrument described in
answer to Question 192 will show the exact movement of the valve. By
comparing the indicator diagram with the motion-curves, the one will
show the defects in the other.[62]

  [62] See description of Richards’ Improved Steam Engine Indicator,
  with directions for its use, by Charles T. Porter, London.

QUESTION 226. _To what extent can the movement of the valve be modified
by alterations in the proportions of the link motion?_

_Answer._ The motion of the valve is susceptible of an almost infinite
number of changes, by different variations and combinations of
proportions of the working parts of the link motion. These changes
are, however, limited by the general laws which govern the motion of
eccentrics, and therefore cannot influence the motion of the valve
beyond certain limits. Hardly any variation can be made either in
the proportions or arrangement of the working parts which will not
have some influence upon the movement of the valve. Aside from the
proportions of the valve itself, which have already been discussed,
the throw of the eccentrics, the length of the rods and of the link,
the point of connection of the rods with the link, the point of
suspension, the position of the lifting shaft, the length of the arms,
the length and position of the rocker arms will each of them effect
the distribution of steam. The number of combinations of all these
different proportions is of course almost infinite, and therefore any
full discussion of them will be impossible here.

QUESTION 227. _What are the most important points which require
attention in designing a link motion?_

_Answer._ It should be proportioned so that--

First, the lead and the period of admission should be the same for each
end of the cylinder, for each point of cut-off, and, if possible, in
back as well as forward gear.

Second, the width of opening for both admission and exhaust should be
as large as possible when steam is cut off short.

Third, the exhaust or pre-release should occur early enough and be
maintained long enough to reduce back-pressure as low as possible.

QUESTION 228. _How can the lead and period of admission be equalized?_

_Answer._ It is impossible to make the periods of admission absolutely
alike for every point of cut-off in both fore and back gear. It is
therefore customary to disregard the back gear, as engines are worked
but little with the link in that position. Even for forward gear the
periods of admission cannot be made exactly alike for each end of the
cylinder and for each point of cut-off, and therefore it is usual to
make the periods of admission alike for half-gear forward, in which
position the link is worked most.

The periods of admission for the front and back ends of the cylinder
can be changed most in relation to each other by altering the position
of the point of suspension on the link. This can be done either by
moving this point up or down, or horizontally. Usually links are
suspended from a point halfway between the points of connection of the
eccentric-rods and from ¹⁄₄ to ³⁄₄ in. back of the centre line of the
slot in the link. A somewhat better distribution can be secured by
suspending it about 3 in. above the centre, but the suspending link
must then be made so short that it is subjected to very great strains
by the motion of the link, and this evil is usually considered much
greater than the advantage which is gained thereby in the more equal
distribution. The point at which the upper end of the suspension link
is hung also influences the relative amount of admission front and
back. This point, of course, varies as the end of the lifting arm is
raised or lowered. In designing valve gear it is usually tested by a
full-sized model, which will show the exact motion of all the parts.
The best position for the lifting shaft and the length of its arm can
be determined perhaps most satisfactorily by placing the link in full
gear forward, then moving the point of suspension of the upper end of
the link-hanger horizontally so that the front and back admission will
be alike, and then marking this position. The same process should then
be repeated for half gear and for the shortest point of cut-off. If the
position of the lifting shaft and the length of its arm are then so
arranged that the end of the latter will move through the three points
which have been thus determined, the admission will be very nearly
equal for each end of the cylinder. Usually, however, it is impossible
to arrange the shaft and arm so that they will conform exactly to these
conditions, and therefore an approximation is made which will come
as near as possible to what is required. It may be stated, however,
that the lifting shaft should be kept as low as possible, so as not to
interfere with the eccentric-rods. In some cases the shaft has been
suspended from the boiler, so that the outside eccentric-rod would work
past or over the end of the lifting shaft, thus allowing the latter to
be located lower than would otherwise be possible.

QUESTION 229. _Which parts of the link-motion have the greatest
influence on the distribution of steam?_

_Answer._ The lap of the valve and the throw of the eccentrics. The
effect of any change of these upon the distribution is very similar to
that produced if a single eccentric is used, which was explained in the
answers to Questions 49, 50 and 52.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 141._]

QUESTION 230. _What is the effect upon the admission of increasing the
throw of the eccentrics with the same lap?_

_Answer._ As already explained, the effect is to increase the period of
admission, or in other words to cut off later in the stroke, and also
to increase the width of the opening of the steam-port or the distance
which the valve throws over the port. This has an important influence
upon the admission, when the link-motion is used.

QUESTION 231. _What is meant by the angular advance of the eccentrics?_

_Answer._ It is the angle which a line, _e f_, fig. 141, drawn through
the centre of the axle and the centre of the eccentric makes with a
vertical line _a b_, when the crank is on one of the dead-points or
centres. Thus in fig. 141 the crank _A_ is represented on the front
centre. In order to give the valve the necessary lead the eccentric
must be moved ahead of the vertical line _a b_. The angle _c_ which the
line _e f_ (drawn through the centre of _g_ of the eccentric and _f_ of
the axle) makes with the vertical line is called the _angular advance_.

QUESTION 232. _What is meant by linear advance?_

_Answer._ By linear advance is meant the distance which the valve has
moved from its middle position at the beginning of the stroke of the
piston. This, when the two rocker arms are the same length, is the same
as the distance of the centre of the eccentric _g_ from the vertical
line _a b_, fig. 141.

QUESTION 233. _Why does the cut-off occur earlier with an eccentric
having a short throw than with one which gives more travel to the
valve?_

_Answer._ Because it is necessary to give the eccentric with the short
throw more angular advance in order to give the valve the required
lead. This is illustrated in fig. 142, in which a section of a valve,
_V_, and ports _c_, _g_, and _d_, are represented. In order to simplify
the diagram as much as possible the rocker is left out and the valve
is supposed to be moved by the rod _R_ directly from the centre _a_ of
the eccentric.[63] The effect of the angularity of the connecting rod
and eccentric rod is also neglected. The circle _a b e f_ represents
the path of the centre of an eccentric having 5 in. throw, and _h i
j_ the path of one having 3¹⁄₂ in. throw. In order to give the valve
the required lead, which is supposed to be just line-and-line at the
beginning of the stroke, the linear advance of the valve must be equal
to the lap, or ⁷⁄₈ in. If therefore we draw a line, _p a_, parallel to
the vertical centre line, _e k_, and ⁷⁄₈ in. from it, the intersection
of _p a_ at _a_ and _h_ with the paths of the eccentric will be the
centres of the eccentrics. If through these centres and the centre of
the circle, lines, _o a_ and _o p_, be drawn, the angles which they
make with the vertical _e k_ will be the angular advance. It will be
seen from these lines that in order to give the valve the required
lead it is necessary to give the eccentric with the small travel more
angular advance than is necessary for the one with the larger throw.
It is obvious, too, that when the centre of the larger eccentric has
reached the point _b_ the valve will have received its greatest travel,
and that when it reaches _p_ the steam-port _c_ will again be closed or
the steam cut off. If the small eccentric is employed, the valve will
then have its maximum travel when the centre _h_ reaches _s_, and the
port will be closed when it reaches _i_. By drawing lines, _o p_ and _o
n_, through _i_ and _p_, it will be seen that from the beginning of the
stroke until the steam is cut off, if the large eccentric is employed,
it, and consequently the shaft and crank, must move over an angle
measured by the arc _q t p_. If the small eccentric is used, it and the
crank must move through an angle measured by the arc _u t n_. In other
words, the crank must turn a considerably greater distance before steam
is cut off with an eccentric having a large than with one having a
small throw.

  [63] It will be seen that this causes the position of the centre of
  the eccentric to be reversed.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 142._

  _Fig. 143._

Scale ³⁄₁₆ in. = 1 inch.]

It is also quite obvious from fig. 142 why the port is opened a shorter
distance with a small than with a large eccentric. The distances _o
s_ and _o b_ are equal to half the throws of the eccentrics, or 1³⁄₄
and 2¹⁄₂ in. The linear advance _o r_ is in both cases ⁷⁄₈ in., and
therefore after the port begins to open the valve will be moved by the
small eccentric a distance which is equal to 1³⁄₄ - ⁷⁄₈ = ⁷⁄₈ in., and
by the large one 2¹⁄₂ - ⁷⁄₈ = 1⁵⁄₈ in.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 144._

Scale ³⁄₁₆ in. = 1 inch.]

QUESTION 234. _What is the effect on the admission of giving an
eccentric with a small throw the same angular advance as one with a
large throw, and then reducing the lap of the valve so that the lead
will be the same in both cases?_

_Answer._ The admission and the cut-off will then occur at the same
points of the stroke, but the ports will not be opened so wide. This is
illustrated in fig. 143, in which the paths of two eccentrics having
the same throw as those in fig. 142 are represented. The centre, _a_,
of the larger eccentric is represented in the same position in fig.
143 as in fig. 142. If a line is drawn from the centre of the larger
eccentric to that of the axle, and if the centre, _h_, of the smaller
eccentric is located on the intersection of this line with the circle
representing its path, then the smaller eccentric will have the same
angular advance, but the linear advance measured by the distance _o t_
will be only ⁵⁄₈ in. If the valve have the same lap as in fig. 142,
its steam edges at the beginning of the stroke, if the small eccentric
is employed, will occupy the position represented by the dotted lines
_A_ and _B_. If these edges are cut off, as shown by the full lines
and shading, then the valve will have the same lead as in fig. 142.
It is obvious, too, that if the smaller eccentric has the same
angular advance it will reach the point _v_, at which, with the reduced
lap, the steam will be cut off, at the same time that the centre,
_a_, of the large eccentric will reach _p_, at which point it cuts
off the steam with the valve having the large lap. There is, however,
this difference in the distribution, that in the one case the valve
opens the port a distance equal to _t s_, and in the other a distance
equal to _r b_. As _o t_ is equal to the linear advance of the small
eccentric, or ⁵⁄₈ in., and _o s_ to half the throw of the eccentric,
or 1³⁄₄, _t s_ is equal to 1³⁄₄ - ⁵⁄₈ = 1¹⁄₈ in. The distance _r b_,
as shown above, is equal to 2¹⁄₂ - ⁷⁄₈ = 1⁵⁄₈ in., so that the effect
produced upon the admission of using an eccentric with a small throw
and corresponding amount of lap is, that the ports are not opened so
wide as with an eccentric having a larger throw.

  _Fig. 145._

Scale ³⁄₁₆ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 235. _How do eccentrics with a short throw, and valves with a
corresponding amount of lap, affect the admission with a link motion as
compared with eccentrics having a larger amount of throw and greater
lap of valve?_

_Answer._ The chief difference is that the ports are not opened so
wide for the same period of admission. Thus in fig. 144 is a series of
motion-curves drawn with a model of a link motion like that illustrated
in fig. 103. The eccentrics had 5 in. throw, and the valve ⁷⁄₈ in. lap
outside and ¹⁄₁₆ in. inside. Fig. 145 represents a series of curves,
drawn with the same arrangement of valve-gear, excepting that the
eccentrics had 3¹⁄₂ in. throw and the valve ¹⁄₂ in. lap. In both cases
the curves represent the motion of the valve when cutting off at the
same point of the stroke. The following table will show the relative
amount of opening of the port.

   21  „  | 1¹⁄₄[64] „ |   1¹⁄₃₂  „
  --------+------------+---------------

  [64] The valve throws over 1³⁄₄ in. at this point.

It will be seen from this that the eccentric with 5 in. throw gives a
greater width of opening for every point of cut-off than the one with
3¹⁄₂ in. throw. For the higher admissions this is not important, but
when steam is cut off short it will be observed that the width of the
opening is very small. At high speeds the small opening is a great
disadvantage.

QUESTION 236. _Has it been determined what amount of opening is
required for given speeds of the piston?_

_Answer._ Not with any degree of accuracy. It is customary to make
the area of the ports about one-tenth that of the piston. It is
certain, however, that with steam-ports of this proportion an opening
considerably less than their whole area is sufficient to maintain steam
at boiler pressure in the cylinders. One of the defects of the link
motion is that the opening of the port is very small when the steam is
cut off short. It is best, therefore, to secure the largest practicable
opening of the ports for the lower points of cut-off.

QUESTION 237. _What are the proportions of the valves and eccentrics
used in the ordinary practice in this country?_

_Answer._ The following report made by a committee of the Master
Mechanics’ Association will show the proportions used on thirty-five
different railroads, and is a fair indication of the common practice.

QUESTION 238. _What should be the width of the bridge between the steam
and exhaust ports?_

_Answer._ It is usually made about the same thickness as the sides of
the cylinder, in order to secure a good casting; but sometimes it is
necessary to make it wider, in order to prevent steam from escaping
from the steam-chest into the exhaust, which is apt to be the case if a
valve has little lap and a long travel.

QUESTION 239. _What determines the width of the exhaust-port?_

_Answer._ The throw of the valve. This will be clear if we refer to
fig. 146, which represents a valve with a travel of 5¹⁄₂ in. It will
be seen that when it is in the extreme position in which it is shown
the width _A_ of the opening of the exhaust-port is very small. If
this opening is contracted too much it will of course interfere with
the free escape of the exhaust steam. It is therefore best to make the
exhaust-port so wide that with the greatest travel of the valve the
width of its opening will be either quite or very nearly equal to the
width of the steam-port.

QUESTION 240. _Where is the reverse lever located and how is it
constructed?_

_Answer._ It is located on the _foot-board_[65] _K′ K′_, as shown in
plate II. It consists of a lever _O_, _O_, with the fulcrum at the
lower end. The _reverse-rod e k_, which connects the lever with the
vertical arm _k_ of the lifting-shaft, is attached above the fulcrum of
the reverse lever. Figs. 147 and 148 represent side and end views of
the lever on an enlarged scale and with some of the details attached
which are omitted on plate II. _C_, _C_ are two curved bars, which in
this country are usually called _quadrants_, but in England are called
(and more properly) _sectors_. These are placed on each side of the
reverse-lever and are fastened to some portion of the engine. They have
notches, _n_, _n_, _n_, cut in them to receive the _latch L_, which
slides in a clamp, _H_, and holds the reverse-lever in the notches in
which it is placed. This latch is operated by a _trigger_, _D_, which
is grasped by the locomotive runner when he takes hold of the handle
_A_ of the reverse-lever. The trigger works on a pin, _E_, as a fulcrum
and is attached to the latch by a rod, _r r_. When the trigger is
pressed up against the handle, the latch is raised out of the notches
by the rod _r r_, and is pressed into them again by the spring _s_
when the trigger is released. _F_ is a set-screw which presses against
a gib, _G_, and is intended to keep the latch tight and prevent the
reverse-lever from shaking.

  [65] The _foot-board_ _K′ K′_, plates 2 and 3, is a platform for the
  locomotive runner and fireman to stand on and is located at the back
  end of the engine.

QUESTION 241. _How are the notches in the sector arranged?_

_Answer._ They are usually arranged so that the steam will be cut off
at some full number of inches of the stroke when the reverse-lever is
in each one of the notches. They are therefore located so that the
steam will be cut off at 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 inches, or at 6, 8,
10, 12, 15, 18 and 21 inches of the stroke. A notch is also placed so
as to hold the link in mid-gear. In some cases as many notches as there
is room for are put into the sectors. The latter seems to be much the
best plan, as it gives more gradations in which the valve-gear can be
worked, and it is a matter of no consequence whatever in the working of
an engine whether the steam is cut off at some full or some fractional
number of inches of the stroke. By referring to fig. 144 it will be
seen how very great the difference of the distribution of steam must
be, as indicated by the 5th, 6th and 7th motion-curves.

QUESTION 242. _How long should the reverse-lever be?_

_Answer._ The lever should be sufficiently long so that in throwing the
link from full gear forward to full gear backward the handle _A_ will
move _not less_ than four times the distance that the link is moved. It
is much better to give the end of the handle _A_ five or even six times
the motion of the link, as there will then be a much easier action in
reversing the engine. This will also make it possible to use longer
sectors, and give room for more notches.

QUESTION 243. _What provision is made in the reversing gear for
overcoming or neutralizing the weight of the link and other parts of
the valve-gear?_

_Answer._ Their weight is counterbalanced by the pressure of a spring
of some kind. In fig. 103 the two volute springs enclosed in a case,
_H_, are used for this purpose. These are compressed by the rod _m_,
which is attached to a short arm _l_, on the reverse shaft _A_, when
the link is lowered, and consequently the tension of the spring resists
the weight of the link when the latter is down or in forward gear.
Different kinds of springs are used for this purpose and sometimes are
attached to the reverse-lever instead of to the lifting-shaft.

QUESTION 244. _What is meant by “setting” a slide-valve?_

_Answer._ It is to fasten the eccentrics in the right position on the
axle and to adjust the length of the eccentric-rods and valve-stem so
that the valves will give the required distribution of steam.

QUESTION 245. _How are the valves of a locomotive set?_

_Answer._ After the wheels, axles, main connecting-rods and valve-gear
are connected together, put the rocker-arm in its middle position, and
lengthen or shorten the valve-stem so that the valve will be in the
centre of the valve-face. Then place the crank on the forward centre
and the full part of the forward motion eccentric above and that of the
backward motion eccentric below the axle, and fasten them to the axle
temporarily by tightening up the set-screws. Then throw the link down
until the block comes opposite to the end of the eccentric-rod, and
turn the wheels,[66] and at the same time, observe whether the travel
of the valve is equal to the throw of the eccentric and also whether it
travels equally on each side of the centre of the valve-face. If its
travel is greater than the throw of the eccentric, raise the link up;
if less, lower it down until the two are just equal, and then mark the
position for the notches on the sections or quadrants to receive the
latch of the reverse-lever. If the valve does not travel equally on
each side of the centre of the valve-face, either lengthen or shorten
the eccentric-rod, as may be necessary. Repeat this operation for the
backward motion, by raising the link up until the block is opposite
the end of the lower eccentric-rod. After having done this, go over
the whole process again to see whether it is all correct. Now with
the crank on the forward centre, and the link in full gear forward,
loosen the set-screws in the forward eccentric, and move it around the
axle so that the valve will have the required lead and then fasten it
again. Now raise the link up into full back gear, and set the backward
eccentric in the same way. Then turn the wheels so as to bring the
crank on the back centre, and observe whether the lead is correct
for the back end of the cylinder. If it is not, lengthen or shorten
the valve-stem or eccentric-rod so as to make the lead alike at both
ends, and if it is then too much or too little, it can be increased or
diminished by moving the eccentrics on the axle.

  [66] This can be done by moving the engine on the track, or by
  raising it off its wheels, so that the latter can be turned without
  moving the former. In some shops a pair of rollers is put in the
  track so that by placing the driving wheels on them they can be
  turned without any difficulty.

Great care must be taken in setting valves to be sure that the cranks
are exactly on the centres or dead points, and it is impossible to
set them in that position with sufficient accuracy from the motion of
the piston or cross-head, and therefore the centres of the crank-pins
should always be set so as to conform to a line drawn through the
centre of the cylinder and the axle. When the cylinders are horizontal,
it is of course only necessary to place the cranks on a horizontal line
drawn through the centre of the axle.

When the valves are set it should also be noticed whether the
axle-boxes (whose construction will be explained hereafter) are in
the centre of the jaws, and if not they should be moved to the centre
by driving wooden wedges between them and the frames, either above
or below, as may be required. The position of the boxes has a very
material influence on the valve-gear.

If it is intended to lay off the notches on the sectors so as to cut
off steam at certain definite points of the stroke, these points should
be laid off in the guides from the motion of the cross-head. The latter
being placed in any of the required positions at which steam is to be
cut off, the reverse-lever should then be moved so that the link will
just close the admission port. The lever can then be clamped to the
sectors, and the wheels turned so as to show whether its position is
correct for each end of the stroke. As before stated it is impossible
to get the ordinary link-motion to cut off at exactly the same points
at both ends of the cylinder, but a very close approximation can be
made by proportioning the different parts properly. As has already been
stated, it is believed to be a much better plan to put as many notches
in the sectors as possible, than to locate them for certain definite
points of the stroke.

In setting the valves of locomotives, care must be taken to turn the
wheels _forward_ for the _forward motion_ and _backward_ for the
_backward motion_.

After the valves are set the position of the eccentrics on the shaft
should be marked, so that in case they become loose on the road they
can easily be set again. It is usual, too, to mark the position of
the valves with centre-punch marks on the valve-stem and on the
stuffing-box of the steam-chest, so that with a gauge made for the
purpose the position of the valve can be determined without taking off
the steam-chest cover.

In some cases the eccentrics are keyed on, which is done after
their position is determined by setting the valves. The ends of the
set-screws which are used to fasten the eccentrics should be cup-shaped
and case-hardened, so as to hold as securely as possible to the axle
when they are screwed down.




PART XII.

THE RUNNING GEAR.


QUESTION 246. _What is meant by the running gear of a locomotive?_

_Answer._ It means those parts, such as the wheels, axles and frames,
which carry the other parts of the engine. As the Germans express it,
it is the “_wagon_” of the locomotive.

QUESTION 247. _How may the wheels be classified?_

_Answer._ As _driving_ and _carrying_ or _truck wheels_.

QUESTION 248. _What service must the driving wheels perform?_

_Answer._ The driving wheels, as indicated by their name, “drive”
or move the locomotive on the track, as was explained in answer to
Questions 64, 65 and 66. As their adhesion depends upon the pressure
with which they bear upon the rails, they must carry either a part or
the whole of the weight of the engine.

QUESTION 249. _What proportion of the weight of ordinary locomotives is
usually carried on the driving wheels?_

_Answer._ Eight-wheeled “American” locomotives, which are most commonly
used in this country, have about two-thirds of their weight on the
driving wheels.

QUESTION 250. _What is meant by the “truck” of a locomotive?_

_Answer._ It means one or more pairs of wheels which are attached to a
separate frame and to the locomotive by a flexible connection, so that
the axles are not held rigidly at right angles to the main frame, but
can assume positions which approximate to that of radii of the curves
of the track. In plates I, II and III, _E E_ are the truck wheels, _b′
b′_ the truck frame, and _y_, plate II, and fig. 40, the centre-pin,
around which the truck frame turns.

QUESTION 251. _What service does the truck perform?_

_Answer._ It carries the weight of the front end of the locomotive, and
also guides it into and around curves and _switches_.[67]

  [67] A switch is a movable pair of rails, by which a locomotive is
  enabled to run from one track to another.

QUESTION 252. _How does it perform the latter service?_

_Answer._ It does it very much in the same way as the front wheels of
an ordinary wagon enable it to turn around corners; that is, the truck
wheels being attached to a separate frame, which is connected to the
locomotive by a centre-pin, just as the front axle of an ordinary wagon
is connected by the king-bolt, can turn.

[Illustration: _Fig. 149._

_Fig. 150._

Scale, ³⁄₈ inch = 1 foot.]

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 151._]

QUESTION 253. _Why are two pairs of wheels used on a locomotive instead
of one, as on an ordinary wagon?_

_Answer._ Because it is necessary to have one pair of wheels guide
the other. In an ordinary wagon the front axle is guided by the pole
or shafts. Nearly every one knows the difficulty of moving a wagon
when the pole or shafts are removed, especially if it be pushed from
behind. The movement of the front axle is then uncontrolled, and it
is impossible to direct the motion of the vehicle. The same thing
would occur with a locomotive if a single pair of wheels were used,
and attached in the same way as the front axle of a wagon. Thus if a
single pair of wheels were connected to a locomotive by a centre-pin,
_a_, fig. 149, so that the axle would be free to move around this
pin, then if one of the wheels should strike an obstruction, say a
stone, _s_, fig. 150, there would be nothing to prevent the axle from
being thrown into the position shown in fig. 150, and the wheels would
be quite sure to leave the track. When two pairs of wheels are used
and both axles attached to the same frame, which is connected to the
engine by a centre-pin, _s_, fig. 151, between the two axles, then
the wheels in moving round the centre-pin must move around the centre
_s_ in arcs of circles, _m n_, _m n_, described from the centre _s_.
These arcs, it will be observed, cross the rails. Now if the wheels
should move in that direction, the flange of one of them would come in
contact with the rail and prevent it from moving any farther. It is
therefore evident that wheels arranged in that way can only move about
the centre-pin as far as the curvature of the track will permit. Trucks
are sometimes used with only one pair of wheels, but the centre-pin
is then placed some distance behind the centre of the axle, or in the
same relation to it that the centre _s_ is to the axle _a a′_ in fig.
151. It is evident that if the frame for such a truck turns around the
centre-pin, the wheels must move across the track in the same way
as represented by the arcs _m n_, in fig. 151. The construction and
operation of trucks with a single pair of wheels will be more fully
explained hereafter.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 153._

_Scale

  _Fig. 154._

  _Fig. 155._

  _Fig. 156._]

QUESTION 254. _Why will a locomotive run around curves easier if the
front axles are attached to a truck frame which is connected to the
locomotive by a flexible connection?_

_Answer._ Because the truck axles can then assume positions which
conform very nearly to the radii of the curves of the track, and it is
well known that if two or more axles, each with a pair of wheels on
it, are attached to a frame with their centre lines parallel with each
other, as shown in fig. 152, they will roll in a straight line, but if
the centre lines of the axles are inclined to each other, as shown in
fig. 153, the tendency will be to roll in a curve, the radius of which
will depend upon the degree of inclination of the axles to each other.
In order to make the wheels in fig. 152 roll on the curves _a b_ and _c
d_, it will be necessary to slide them laterally a distance equal to
that between the curves and the straight lines _m o_ and _p r_, and as
the length of the outside curve is greater than the inside one, if the
wheels are fastened to the axles so they cannot turn on them and roll
on the curves, either the wheels on the inside or those on the outside
must slip a distance equal to the difference in the length of the two
curves. Considerable force will therefore be required to overcome the
resistance due to the combined lateral and circumferential sliding of
the wheels, so that more power will be needed to make them roll in
a curve than is necessary to make them roll in a straight line. If,
however, the axles are inclined to each other, then the wheels will
naturally roll on a curved path, and it will not be necessary to slide
them sideways to make them conform to such a path. But if the wheels
are all attached to the axles so that those on the same axle cannot
turn independently of each other and are all of the same diameter, then
either the inside or the outside ones must slip, because the path in
which the outside ones roll is longer than the inside curve, so that
even if the axles are inclined to each other more power will be needed
to roll the truck in a curved path than to roll the wheels shown in
fig. 152 in a straight line. It is, however, a fact that a cone or
a portion of a cone like that shown in fig. 154 will of itself roll
on a curve. It will do the same thing if the middle is cut away, as
indicated by the dotted lines in fig. 154 and as shown in fig. 155. If
now the wheels are made so that their peripheries[68] form portions
of a cone and the axles are inclined to each other as shown in fig.
156, then there will be no slipping on the track, because the outside
wheel, being larger in diameter than the inside one, advances further
in one revolution than the latter does, and thus rolls on the longest
path in the same time that the inside or smaller wheel does on the
shorter one. When this is the case, such wheels will roll in a curve
as easily as those in fig. 152 will in a straight line. The degree of
inclination of the axles and of the sides of the cone must, however,
vary with the radius of the curve. But if the axles are parallel to
each other, and the wheels conical, as represented in fig. 157, they
will not roll either in a straight line or in a curve without great
difficulty, because if they roll in a straight line, the wheels on
one side being larger in diameter than those on the other, either the
larger or the smaller ones must slip on the path in which they roll.
If they roll on a curve, then each pair of wheels has a tendency to
roll in a curve independent of the other, and therefore the wheels must
slip laterally if both pairs roll on the same track. Thus, suppose
two pairs of wheels, _a_, _a′_, and _b_, _b′_, fig. 157, to be made
conical and attached to a frame so that their axles are parallel to
each other. Now each pair of such wheels will have a tendency to roll
in circular paths, _a′ i_, _a h_, and _b′ k_, _b j_, the centres of
which are at _m_ and _n_, or at the apices of the cones of which their
peripheries form a part. If they are made to roll in circular paths, _c
d_, _e f_, described from a point _g_, then each pair of wheels must
slip laterally over the space between the paths _a′ i_, _a h_, in which
they would naturally roll and that in which they are made to roll. Thus
the wheel _a_ would slide laterally the distance between the curve _a
h_ and _a f_, and _a′_ that between _a′ i_ and _c d_; _b_ would slide
from _b j_ to _b f_ and _b′_ from _b′ k_ to _b′ d_. It will thus be
seen that in order that two pairs of wheels may roll with equal ease
in a straight line and in curves, the wheels in the one case must be
of equal diameters and the axles parallel, and in the other case the
wheels must be of unequal diameters and their axles be _radial_[69] to
the curve. This is equally true of any number of pairs of wheels. If
we have three, four, or any number of axles, with wheels all attached
to the same frame, if their axles are parallel, and the wheels of the
same diameter, they will roll in a straight line; but if their wheels
are conical and their axles radial, they will roll in a curve.

  [68] The periphery is the outside surface on which the wheel rolls.
  This part of a wheel is usually called the “_tread_.”

  [69] That is, that their centre lines incline towards each other, and
  if extended far enough would meet at the centre of the curve.

For the preceding reasons it is therefore sufficiently obvious that
if a locomotive is to run on both straight and curved tracks, on
the former the wheels should be of the same diameter and the axles
parallel, and on the latter the wheels should be conical and the axles
radial.

[Illustration: _Fig. 158._

_Fig. 159._

Scale ³⁄₈ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 255. _How are the wheels made so that in curves they will act
as though they were of the conical form described and on a straight
track all be of the same diameters?_

_Answer._ The periphery or tread of each wheel is made conical, but of
the same size as the other, and with the small diameter of the cone
outside, as shown in fig. 158. On a straight track if the position of
the wheels on the rails is such that their two flanges are equally
distant from the rails, as shown, then obviously at the points of
contact with the rails the wheels are of the same diameter. That
is, _a_ is equal to _b_. But in running on a curved track, if the
wheels are of the same diameter, as has been shown, they will roll in
a straight line and consequently towards the outside of the curve.
The flange _c_--supposing it to be at the outside of the curve--will
therefore roll towards the rail, and consequently the outside wheel
will rest on the rail at a point nearer the flange, as shown in fig.
159, where the diameter _a_ is larger, and the inside one further from
the flange where the diameter _b_ is smaller than at _a_ and _b_ in
fig. 158; and consequently the action of the wheels is the same as
though their peripheries were made of the form shown in fig. 157.

QUESTION 256. _How are the axles of locomotives made to assume a
position radial to the curves in the track?_

_Answer._ This is only done approximately, as the mechanical
difficulties in the way of doing it perfectly are so great as to
render it impracticable. By attaching the truck to the locomotive by
a flexible connection or centre-pin, _s_, as shown in fig. 160 (which
represents a plan of the wheels of an ordinary locomotive), it is plain
that the truck axles _e f_ and _g h_, instead of remaining parallel
to the driving-axles _a b_ and _c d_, will, by turning around the
centre-pin, _s_, adjust themselves to the curve so as to approximate as
closely to radii as is possible for two axles which are held parallel
to each other. Of course the further apart they are the greater will be
their divergence from the position of radii, and whether the tread
of the wheels be cylindrical or conical the further apart their axles
are the greater will be the divergence of the paths in which they would
naturally roll from that of any curve on which they must roll. Thus, if
the axles were twice as far apart as they are represented in fig. 157,
and in the position shown in the dotted lines _l l′_ and _o o′_, the
wheels, if they are conical, would then naturally roll in curves drawn
from the centres _p_ and _q_. If the wheels are cylindrical, they would
roll in straight lines. In either case the divergence of their paths
_l s_ and _l r_ from the curve of the track is greater than _a h_ and
_a′ i_, the paths in which they would roll if their axles were nearer
together. This divergence increases with the distance between the
axles, and therefore the lateral slip of the wheels must be in the same
proportion.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 160._

_Scale ³⁄₁₆ Inch -- 1 Foot._]

QUESTION 257. _Is the resistance to rolling diminished by placing the
truck axles nearer together?_

_Answer._ It is, within certain limits. The nearer each other they are
placed, the closer will the centre-pin of the truck be to the centre of
the axles. The closer it is to the centre of the axle, the greater is
the tendency of the wheels to become “slewed,” or to assume a diagonal
position to the rails as represented in fig. 150, and thus increase
the resistance and also the danger of running off the track. The
increase of resistance from this cause, after the axles reach a certain
distance from each other, is greater than the decrease from a closer
approximation to the position of radii. In ordinary locomotives it is
necessary to place the truck wheels from 5 ft. 6 in. to 6 ft. apart, in
order to get the cylinders between them in a horizontal position. This
distance apart works very well in ordinary practice.

QUESTION 258. _What is meant by flange friction?_

_Answer._ It is the friction of the flanges of the wheels against the
head of the rails. Thus if two pairs of wheels, _a a′_, _b b′_, fig.
151, be placed on a curve and rolled in the direction of the dart, the
wheel _a_ will roll towards the outside of the curve until the flange
comes in contact with the rail. As already explained, if two axles
are parallel to each other, no matter whether the wheels are conical
or cylindrical, they must slip laterally in order to roll in a curved
path. As the flange must follow the curve of the rail, it forces the
wheel laterally and thus compels it to roll in the curved path into
which the rail is bent. As the wheel offers considerable resistance
to sliding there is a corresponding pressure of the flange against
the rail, and consequently the revolutions of the wheel produce an
abrasive action between the two. This action is obviously increased
with the distance between the axles, because, as has been shown, the
lateral slip of the wheels is then greater than when they are nearer
together. It is also obvious that if the wheels are parallel with the
rails there will be no abrasive action of the flanges, but that the
greater the angle at which the wheels stand to the rails the harder
will the flanges rub against the rails, and the greater will be the
flange friction. With the aid of geometry it can very easily be proved
that the farther apart two parallel axles are, the greater will be the
angle of the wheels to the rails on a curved track, and, therefore, the
greater will be their flange friction. It must, however, be remembered
that if the wheels are so close together that they are liable to
become “slewed,” or assume a diagonal position across the rails, as
shown in fig. 150, the angle at which the wheels would stand to the
rails would thus be very much increased. It has therefore come to be a
very generally recognized rule that the centres of axles should never
be placed nearer together than the distance between the rails.

QUESTION 259. _Is the flange friction of all the wheels of a truck the
same on any given curve?_

_Answer._ No; of the front wheels obviously only the flange of the one
on the outside of the curve comes in contact with the rail. As the
centrifugal force of the engine presses the back pair of wheels towards
the outside of the curve, the flange of the outside wheel alone comes
in contact with the rail. But as this wheel is constantly rolling
_away_ from the rail, as shown by the dotted lines _h g_, fig. 151,
obviously the friction of its flange is less than that of the front
outside wheel, which always rolls _towards_ the rail. The flange of the
back inside wheel is carried outwards by the centrifugal force and also
by the tendency of the wheels to roll on their largest diameters on a
curve, so that its flange will not touch the rail.

QUESTION 260. _Can the axles of driving wheels assume positions radial
to the track?_

_Answer._ In ordinary engines they cannot. Various plans have been
devised for the purpose of enabling them to do so, but it is only
recently that they have met with any success. Some of these plans
will be described hereafter. It is, however, of less importance that
the driving axles, when they are behind the centre of the locomotive,
should assume positions radial to a curved track than that the front
wheels should. This is illustrated by a common road wagon, as all know
the ease with which such a vehicle can turn a corner if we run it with
the front axle ahead, and the difficulty of doing so when the back axle
is in front. In the case of a locomotive the reason for it is very much
the same as that which makes the flange friction of the back wheels
of a truck less than that of the front ones. From fig. 160 it will be
seen that the outside driving-wheels, when the engine is running with
the truck in front, are rolling _from_ the rail and not against it.
As stated before, the centrifugal force of the engine when in motion
has a tendency to throw the wheels towards the outside of the curve.
It will also be noticed that the front driving axle is near the centre
of that portion of the curve which lies between the centre s of the
truck and the centre _k_ of the back axle. If it were in the middle
between them, it would be exactly radial to the curve; being near the
middle, it approximates closely to that position, and therefore the
flange friction of its wheels is very slight. It will be noticed that
if the flange of the back or trailing-wheel on the inside of the curve
were not kept away from the rail it would roll toward and impinge
against that rail. But it will be noticed that the flange of the front
driving-wheel will come in contact with the inside rail before that
on the back wheel can touch it. For this reason, and also on account
of the effect of the centrifugal force exerted on the engine and the
tendency of the wheels to roll on their largest diameters, the flange
of the inside back wheel is kept out of contact with the rail, and as
the back wheel on the outside of the curve rolls away from the rail
there is very little friction of the flanges of the back driving-wheels.

It will also be noticed from fig. 160, that if the radius of the
curve is very short, the bend of the rails between the back pair
of driving-wheels and the centre of the truck is so great that the
inside rail will press hard against the flange of the front or main
driving-wheel next that rail. This of course produces a great deal of
friction, and if the curve is excessively short the flange will mount
on top of the rail and the tread of the opposite wheel will fall off
from its rail. For this reason the centre-pin of the truck is sometimes
arranged so that it can move laterally, that is cross-wise of the
track. In fig. 160 the centre-pin is represented as having moved some
distance from the actual centre of the truck, which is represented with
dotted lines. The front wheels of locomotives are also sometimes made
with wide “flat” tires, that is, tires without flanges, so that there
will be no friction against the one rail and no danger of falling off
the other.

Another action also takes place which facilitates the motion of the
driving-wheels of ordinary engines around curves. Every one knows how
easy the direction in which the front wheels of a common wagon can be
controlled by taking hold of the end of the tongue or pole. With the
leverage which it gives the wheels and axle can easily be directed
wherever it is desired. A similar action takes place in an ordinary
locomotive. The front driving-axles are guided by the truck, which is
attached to the frame ten or twelve feet in front of the driving-axle,
and thus the track exerts a leverage to guide the movement of the
driving-axles, just as a common wagon can be guided by the pole.

If the locomotive is run backward, then none of these advantages exist,
and the flange friction of the back driving-wheels is excessive.
Engines such as construction locomotives, which run backward as much
as forward, wear out the flanges of the back wheels very rapidly on
crooked roads.

QUESTION 261. _What is meant by the “spread” of the wheels or axles?_

_Answer._ It is the distance between the centres of two axles.

QUESTION 262. _What is the “wheel-base” of a locomotive?_

_Answer._ It is the distance between the centres of the front and back
or trailing-wheels. On ordinary engines, such as that illustrated in
plate I, it is the distance from the centre of the front truck to the
centre of the back driving-wheels.

QUESTION 263. _Is the “coning” of the tread of the wheels of much
practical importance?_

_Answer._ There is great difference of opinion regarding it, but even
if its action is very beneficial, the advantage is very soon lost,
owing to the wear of the wheels. It is, therefore, believed that the
advantage is more apparent in theory than in practice.

QUESTION 264. _How are the driving-wheels of locomotives constructed?_

_Answer._ They are made of cast iron with wrought-iron or steel tires
around the outside. Fig. 161 represents a perspective view of a pair of
locomotive wheels and axle. The central portion of the wheel, that is
the hub, spokes and rim, are cast in one piece. Usually the hub and
the rim, and sometimes the spokes, are cast hollow. The central portion
of the wheel, that is the part which is made of cast iron, is called
the _wheel-centre_.

[Illustration: Fig. 161.]

QUESTION 265. _How are the tires fastened on the wheel-centres?_

_Answer._ The insides of the tires are usually turned out somewhat
smaller than the outside of the wheel-centre. The tire is then heated
so that it will expand enough to go on the centre. It is then cooled
off, and the contraction of the metal binds it firmly around the cast
iron part of the wheel. As an additional security bolts or set-screws,
_a_, _a_, fig. 161, are screwed through the rim and into the tire to
prevent it from slipping off in case it becomes loose. In some cases
the wheel-centre and the inside of the tire are turned conical, and the
tires are then put on cold and held on with hook-headed bolts, _C_, as
shown in fig. 162, which is a section of the tire and the rim of the
wheel. The wheel-centre is made largest on the inside. As the strain
against the flange of the tire is inward, the cone of the wheel-centre
resists this strain. If it was curved or tapered the reverse way, the
strain would come on the bolts, and it would also be impossible to
remove the tires without first taking the wheels off the axles. This
method of putting on tires has the advantage that they can be removed
quickly and without heating the tires.[70]

  [70] It is exclusively used on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

[Illustration: Fig. 162. Scale 3 in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 266. _Are there any standard sizes for the inside diameters of
tires?_

_Answer._ Yes. To avoid the great inconvenience arising from the
diversity in the _inside diameters_ of tires, the American Railway
Master Mechanics’ Association has recommended that the inside diameter
of tires should be made 36, 40, 44, 50, 56 and 62 inches. The thickness
for the first three sizes to be 3 in. and the last three 2¹⁄₂ in.

QUESTION 267. _How are the driving-wheels fastened on the axles?_

_Answer._ The hubs are accurately bored out to receive the axles, and
the latter are turned off so as to fit the hole bored in the wheel. The
axles are then forced into the wheel by a powerful pressure produced
either with a hydraulic or screw press, made for the purpose. In order
to prevent the strain upon the crank-pins from turning the wheels upon
the axle, they are keyed fast with square keys driven into grooves cut
in the axle and in the wheel to receive them. The ends of these keys
are shown at _b_, fig. 161.

QUESTION 268. _How are the crank-pins made?_

_Answer._ They are made of wrought iron or steel and accurately turned
to the size required for the journals for the connecting-rods. Fig.
164 represents one of the main crank-pins, and fig. 163 a back pin for
an American engine. The main pin has two journals, one, _B_, to which
the main connecting-rod is attached, and the other, _A_, receiving
the coupling-rod. The back pin has only one journal, _A_, for the
coupling-rod.

QUESTION 269. _How are the crank-pins fastened to the wheels?_

_Answer._ They are turned so as to fit accurately holes which are bored
in the wheels, and are usually “straight” or cylindrical. The pins are
then either driven in with blows from a heavy weight swung from the
end of a rope, or else pressed in with a screw or hydraulic press.
Sometimes the holes are bored tapered or conical and the pins turned to
the same form. They are then ground in with emery and oil, so as to fit
perfectly, and are secured by a large nut and key on the inside of the
wheel.

_Fig. 164._

Scale 1¹⁄₂ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 270. _What are the pieces A, A, fig. 161, between the spokes
of the wheel for?_

_Answer._ They are called _counterbalance weights_, and are put in the
wheels to balance the weight of the crank-pins, connecting-rods and
pistons. The principle of their action will be explained hereafter.

QUESTION 271. _On what part of the axle does the weight of the engine
rest?_

_Answer._ It rests on the driving-axle boxes _L_, fig. 161, which are
placed just inside and close to the wheel.

[Illustration: Fig. 165.]

QUESTION 272. _What are the driving-axle boxes for and how are they
made?_

_Answer._ They are cast iron blocks, _L_, fig. 161, which embrace and
rest on the axle. The part of the axle on which the box bears is called
the _journal_. Each box has a brass bearing, _c_, fig. 165, which bears
on top of the journal and which is consequently exposed to the friction
and wear. Fig. 165 is a perspective view of a driving-box, which shows
what is called the _oil-cellar_, _d_. This is a receptacle underneath
the axle which is filled with wool or cotton waste and saturated with
oil for the purpose of lubricating the journal. The oil-cellar is held
in its position by two bolts, _f_, _f_, which pass through it and the
driving-box casting. By removing the bolts the oil-cellar can easily be
removed and the box can then be taken off the axle.

QUESTION 273. _How are the truck wheels made?_

_Answer._ They are made of cast iron, usually in one piece. Figs. 166
and 167 represent sections of two forms of wheels used for cars. Those
used for locomotive trucks are similar to these, excepting that they
are usually a little smaller in diameter. They are made with a disc or
plate which unites the tire to the hub, and in some cases they have
ribs cast in the inside, as shown in the two figures. Some are made
with single and others with double plates, as shown in the engravings,
and still others with spokes similar to the driving-wheels. The tread
of the wheel is hardened by a process called _chilling_. This is done
by pouring the melted cast iron into a mould of the form of the tread
of the wheel. The mould is also made of cast iron, but being cold cools
the melted iron very suddenly, and thus hardens it somewhat as steel is
hardened when it is heated and plunged into cold water.[71]

  [71] It should be mentioned here that it is only certain kinds of
  cast iron which will be hardened in this way, or will “_chill_,” as
  it is called. The cause to which this chilling property is due is not
  known.

QUESTION 274. _How are the boxes, journals and journal-bearings of the
truck-wheels made?_

_Answer._ They are very similar to those for the driving-wheels, their
chief difference being that those for the truck-wheels are smaller than
those for the driving-wheels.

QUESTION 275. _How are the frames for locomotives constructed?_

_Answer._ The frames, _H H H_, plates I, II and III, are made of bars
of wrought iron from 3 to 4 inches thick and about the same in width.
They are usually made in two parts, the one at the back part of the
engine, to which the driving-boxes and axles are attached, and the
other at the front end, to which the cylinders are bolted. The back
part, or main frame, as it is called, is represented in figs. 168 and
169, and consists of a top bar, _H H_, to which pieces, _a_, _a′_,
_b_, _b′_, called _frame-legs_, are welded. Two of these form what is
called a _jaw_, which receives the axle-box, as shown in fig. 169. To
the bottom of each jaw a _clamp_, _c_, is bolted to hold the two legs
together. The two legs, _a_ and _b′_, are united by a brace, _d d_,
welded to the bottom of the legs. A brace, _m_, unites the back end of
the frame with the leg _b_, and is welded to each.

The front part of each frame consists of a single bar, _e_, which is
bolted to the back end, as represented in figs. 168 and 169, which show
the construction clearer than any description would. These front bars
extend forward to the front end of the engine, and a heavy timber,
called a _bumper-timber_, _E′ E′_, plates I, II and III, extends across
from one to the other and is bolted to each of them. This timber is
intended to receive the shock or blow when the locomotive runs
against any object, such as a car. The _cow-catcher_ or _pilot_, _S_,
is fastened to this timber.

[Illustration: _Fig. 168._

_Fig. 169._

Scale ³⁄₈ in. = 1 foot.]

The front bar of the frames also has usually two lugs or projections
forged on it, between which the cylinders are attached. The latter are
securely held in their position by wedges, which are driven in between
the lugs and the cylinder castings.

The frames, as already stated, are made of wrought iron and are
accurately planed off over their whole surface.

QUESTION 276. _How are the frames fastened to the boiler?_

_Answer._ As already stated, they are fastened to the cylinders with
wedges and bolts, and as the cylinders are bolted to the smoke-box the
frames are thus rigidly attached to the front end of the boiler. In
order to strengthen those portions of the frames which extend beyond
the front of the smoke-box and to which the bumper-timber is attached,
diagonal braces, _r′ r′_, plates I, II and III are bolted both to the
timber and to each of the frames at their lower ends. The upper ends
are bolted to the smoke-box. Other braces, _d′_, plate II, are also
fastened to the frames and to the barrel of the boiler. The frames
are fastened to the fire-box by clamps, _I_, _I_, plate I, called
_expansion clamps_. These clamps embrace the frames so that the latter
can slide through the former longitudinally. There are also usually
two diagonal braces not shown in plate II, the upper ends of which are
fastened to the back end of the shell of the fire-box at about the
level of the crown-sheet, and the lower ends to the back ends of the
frames. There are also usually transverse braces attached to the lower
part of the frames, thus uniting the two together. The guide-yokes, _j
j_, plate I, are also usually bolted to the frames and to the boiler.
In many cases one only is used, which extends across from one frame to
the other and is fastened to the boiler.

QUESTION 277. _Why are the frames attached to the shell of the fire-box
so as to slide longitudinally through the fastenings?_

_Answer._ Because when the boiler becomes heated it expands, and if it
could not move independent of the frames its expansion would create
a great strain on both itself and the frames. The fastenings to the
fire-box are therefore made so that the frames can move freely through
them lengthwise, but in no other direction.

QUESTION 278. _How much more will the boiler expand than the frames in
getting up steam?_

_Answer._ From ¹⁄₄ to ⁵⁄₁₆ of an inch.

QUESTION 279. _Why is it necessary to support the engine on springs?_

_Answer._ [72]Because, however well a road may be kept up, there will
always be shocks in running over it; these occur at the rail joints and
especially when the ballasting of the ties is not quite perfect. These
shocks affect the wheels first, and by them are transferred through
the axle-boxes to the frame, the engine and the boiler. The faster the
locomotive runs, the more powerful do they become, and therefore the
more destructive to the engine and road, and consequently the faster a
locomotive has to run the more perfect should be the arrangement of the
springs.

  [72] The above answer and much of the material referring to springs
  has been translated from “Die Schule des Locomotivführers,” by
  Messrs. J. Brosius and R. Koch.

If we strike repeatedly with a hammer on a rail, the latter is soon
destroyed, while it can bear without damage a much greater weight than
the hammer lying quietly on it. The axles, axle-boxes and wheels strike
like a hammer on the rails at each shock, while the shock of the rest
of the parts of the engine first reaches and bends the springs, but on
the rails has only the effect of a load greater than usual resting on
them. Another comparison will make still plainer the lessening by the
springs of the injurious effect which the weight of the boiler, etc.,
exercises on the rails.

A light blow with a hammer on a pane of glass is sufficient to shatter
it. If, however, on the pane of glass is laid some elastic substance,
such as india-rubber, and we strike on that, the force of the blow
or the weight of the hammer must be considerably increased before
producing the above-named effect. If the locomotive boiler is put in
place of the hammer, the springs in place of the india-rubber, and the
rails in place of the glass, the comparison will agree with the case
above. From this consideration it will be seen how important it is
to make the weights of the axles, axle-boxes and wheels as light as
possible.

QUESTION 280. _How are the driving-axle boxes arranged so that the
weight of the engine will rest on springs?_

_Answer._ They are arranged so as to slide up and down in the jaws.
Springs, _B_, _B′_, fig. 169, are then placed over the axle-boxes and
above the frames. These springs rest on ~∩~-shaped saddles, _G′_, _G′_,
which bear on the top of the axle-boxes. The frames are suspended to
the ends of the springs by rods or bars, _g_, _g′_, _g_, _g′_, called
_spring-hangers_. As the boiler and most of the other parts of the
engine are fastened to the frames, their weight is suspended on the
ends of the springs, which, being flexible, yield to the weight which
they bear.

QUESTION 281. _How are the frames protected from the wear of the
axle-boxes which results from their sliding up and down in the jaws?_

_Answer._ The insides of the legs, _a_, _a′_, _b_, _b′_, are protected
with _shoes_ or _wedges_, _h_, _h_, which are held stationary, and the
box slides against the faces of the shoes, thus wearing the shoe or
wedge but not the frame.

QUESTION 282. _Why are the shoes usually made wedge-shaped?_

_Answer._ They are made in that way so that when they become worn, by
moving one or both of them up in the jaws, the space between them is
narrowed and the lost motion is taken up. They are moved by the screws
_i_, _i_. If the boxes should become loose from wear, it would cause
the engine to thump at each revolution of the wheels or stroke of the
piston.

QUESTION 283. _How are the springs for the driving-wheels made?_

_Answer._ They are made of steel plates which are placed one on top
of the other. These plates are of different lengths, as shown at _B_,
_B′_, in fig. 169, and are from 3 to 4 in. wide and ⁵⁄₁₆ to ⁷⁄₁₆ thick.
The length of the springs measured from the centre of one hanger to the
centre of the other is usually about three feet.

[Illustration: _Fig. 170._]

[Illustration: _Fig. 171._]

QUESTION 284. _What determines the amount which a spring will bend
under a given load?_

_Answer._ The number of plates, their thickness, length and breadth,
and of course the material of which they are made. This can be
explained if we suppose we have a spring plate of a uniform thickness,
_h_, and a triangular form, of which fig. 170 is a side view and 171
a plan, and that it is clamped fast at its base, _b_. It is a well
known mechanical law that any material of this form and under these
conditions will have a uniform strength through its whole length to
support any load, _P_, suspended at its end, and also that it will bend
or deflect in the form of an arc of a circle.

QUESTION 285. _How are locomotive springs usually made?_

_Answer._ In locomotives the arrangement of springs is always such that
they are either supported in the middle and moved at the two ends, or
such that they are supported at the two ends and loaded in the middle;
for our consideration it is indifferent which of the two kinds of
springs is taken for the present illustration. That shown in plan and
elevation in figs. 172 and 173, which is formed of a wide plate placed
diagonally, and which in reality consists of two such triangular pieces
as were represented in fig. 171 united at their bases _m m_, and loaded
at two opposite corners, _e_ and _f_, would answer the requirements
mentioned if the great breadth, _m m_, were not an obstacle. This
breadth is obviated by cutting the spring into several strips, _a a_,
_b b_, _c c_, _d d_, ... _i_, fig. 173, of equal width, and placing
these not side by side, but one over the other, as shown in figs. 174
and 175.

In order that the separate strips and layers of the spring so made,
figs. 174 and 175, may not slip out of place, the strips _a a_, _b b_,
etc., are made in one piece, and all the plates are inclosed with a
strap, _F_, figs. 176 and 177. The plates, instead of being cut from
a piece like that represented in fig. 173, are, however, made out of
steel of the proper width, and the ends, instead of being cut off
pointed as represented, are sometimes drawn out thinner on the ends,
like the point of a chisel, or oftener still cut off straight, as shown
in fig. 177.

[Illustration: _Fig. 176._

_Fig. 177._

_Fig. 178._

Scale ³⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

In order to hold the plates together a band, _F_, is put around the
middle. This is put on hot, and becomes tight by contracting as it
cools. The centre of the spring has a hole drilled through it with
a pin, _s_, fig. 178 (which shows a cross section of a spring), to
prevent the plates from sliding endwise. The plates at each end usually
have a depression, _a_, fig. 179 (which is a cross section of a plate
on a larger scale than the preceding figure), made in them on one side,
and a corresponding elevation, _b_, on the other. The elevation on one
plate fits into the depression on the other, and thus prevents the
plates from slipping sideways.

QUESTION 286. _How should springs be curved?_

_Answer._ Springs should be curved so that when they bear the greatest
load which they must carry they will be straight. If they are curved
too much they are subjected not only to a strain which bends the
plates, but to one which has a tendency to compress them endwise.
Thus if a spring like that represented in fig. 180 is bent into a
half-circle, it is obvious that the strain at the ends has no tendency
at all to bend the plates, but only to compress them endwise. Near the
middle the strain will of course bend the spring. In the one direction
the spring is flexible and elastic, and in the other it is not; and
as the strain of compression depends on the amount of curvature, the
greater the latter is, the less flexibility and elasticity the spring
will have.

Springs are often given a double curve, as shown in fig. 181. This is
not to be recommended, because when a spring bends the plates must
slide on each other. If they have but a single curve, they will do so
and remain in contact through their whole length, but if they have two
curves they will separate and therefore “gape,” as it is called.

QUESTION 287. _What is meant by the elasticity of a spring?_

_Answer._ It is the amount which a spring will deflect or bend under a
given load without having its form permanently changed. If the bending
is so great that the spring does not recover its original form when
the load is removed, then the strain to which it is subjected is said
to exceed the _limits of elasticity_, and if repeated often it will
ultimately break the spring.

QUESTION 288. _What is meant by the elastic strength and the ultimate
strength of a spring?_

_Answer._ The _elastic strength_ is the strain it will bear without
being strained beyond the limits of elasticity, and the _ultimate
strength_ is the strain which will break it.

QUESTION 289. _What determines the strength of a spring?_

_Answer._ It depends of course (1) upon the material of which the
spring is made; (2) its strength increases in proportion to the number
of plates, and (3) to their width, and (4) in proportion to the square
of their thickness, and (5) as the length diminishes.

Thus, if we wanted to double the strength of a spring like that shown
in figs. 170 and 171, it could be done in either of the following ways:
(1) by making it of material twice as strong; (2) by putting another
plate just like it on top; (3) by doubling the width of the base _b_,
which would make the strength of the whole plate twice what it was
before; (4) by making the whole plate about four-tenths thicker, which
would increase its strength, as already stated, in proportion to the
square of the thickness as 1.4 × 1.4 = 2 nearly; (5) by reducing the
length to one-half what it is in fig. 170.

QUESTION 290. _What determines the elasticity of a spring?_

_Answer._ (1) The material of which it is made; with the same material
the elasticity increases (2) as the number, and (3) as the width of
the plates diminishes, and (4) with the cube of the length, and (5)
decreases with the cube of the thickness of plate.

Thus, supposing the plate in figs. 170 and 171 to be ³⁄₈ in. thick and
the deflection _d_ 2¹⁄₂ in.; the latter would be only half as much or
1¹⁄₄ in. (1) if it were made of material twice as stiff, or (2) with
two such plates, or (3) with one twice as wide at the base. If (4) the
length were doubled, the deflection would be equal to 2 × 2 × 2 = 8
times what it was before, or in proportion to the cube of the length.
If (5) the thickness were doubled the deflection would be _reduced_ in
the same proportion, and would be only one-eighth of 2¹⁄₂ in., or ⁵⁄₁₆
in.

[Illustration: _Fig. 182._

_Fig. 183._

Scale ³⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 291. _What should be the proportion of the plates of a spring
in relation to each other?_

_Answer._ The lower plates should diminish regularly in their lengths.
The reason for this will be apparent from the fact which has already
been stated, that if a triangular plate of uniform thickness is clamped
fast at its base, it will, if loaded at the end, be of uniform strength
throughout its whole length. It is immaterial what the length of the
base of such a triangle is, if the two sides are of equal length and
the thickness of the plate is uniform, not only its strength but the
amount of deflection or bending from any load will be equal all through
its length. If, therefore, we make a spring by cutting a plate formed
of two such triangular pieces united at their bases into strips, as
has already been explained, evidently the spring made of them will
have a uniform strength throughout its whole length. As the strips thus
made diminish in length regularly, it is evident that if the spring
plates are made of steel rolled of the requisite width, their length
should be the same as that of those cut from the plate referred to
above. When this is the case the lower outline, _a b b a_, fig. 183,
of the spring will, when the spring is not bent, be straight lines.
Sometimes the lower outline of springs is made curved, as shown in fig.
182. This gives too much strength near the strap _F_, and too little
near the ends. In drawing springs, therefore, it is best to lay them
out with the plates straight, as shown in figs. 182 and 183, and after
determining the thickness, drawing a straight line from the strap to
the end of the longest plate will give the best form of the spring
and the length of each of the plates. It is necessary, however, to
put a sufficient number of long plates in each spring to give it the
required strength next to the attachment of the hanger. Sometimes one
or more of these long plates are made heavier than the rest. The evil
of this method of construction will be apparent if it is remembered
that the greatest permissible deflection up to the breaking of the
spring decreases with the _cube_ of the thickness of the plate and
its strength increases with the _square_ of the thickness. Now if we
have a spring with say ten plates ³⁄₈ in. thick and one on top ³⁄₄ in.
thick, the thick plate will have a strength _four_ times that of the
thin plates, but its elasticity will be only one-eighth that of the
thin plates, and therefore it will require eight times as much load to
bend it any given distance as is needed to bend the thinner plates the
same distance. But its strength is only four times that of the thin
plates, so that for any given amount of elasticity the thick plate must
bear twice as much load as it has strength to carry. This shows what a
great mistake is committed if some of the plates are made thicker than
others, a conclusion which is supported by practical experience, as
it is found that if the top plates are made thicker than others, the
thick ones break most frequently, which is the necessary result of the
supposed strengthening by increasing the thickness of the top plates.

QUESTION 292. [73]_How can we find by calculation the elasticity or
deflection of a given steel spring?_

  [73] The following rules for calculating the proportion and strength
  of steel springs are from Clark’s Railway Machinery.

_Answer._ BY MULTIPLYING THE BREADTH OF THE PLATES IN INCHES BY THE
CUBE OF THE THICKNESS IN SIXTEENTHS, AND BY THE NUMBER OF PLATES:
DIVIDE THE CUBE OF THE SPAN[74] IN INCHES BY THE PRODUCT SO FOUND, AND
MULTIPLY BY 1.66. THE RESULT IS THE ELASTICITY IN SIXTEENTHS OF AN INCH
PER TON OF LOAD.

  [74] The span is the distance between the centres of the
  spring-hangers when the spring is loaded.

QUESTION 293. _How can we find the span due to a given elasticity and
number and size of plates?_

_Answer._ BY MULTIPLYING THE ELASTICITY IN SIXTEENTHS PER TON BY
THE BREADTH OF PLATE IN INCHES, AND BY THE CUBE OF THE THICKNESS IN
SIXTEENTHS, AND BY THE NUMBER OF PLATES: DIVIDE BY 1.66, AND FIND THE
CUBE ROOT OF THE QUOTIENT. THE RESULT IS THE SPAN IN INCHES.

QUESTION 294. _How can we find the number of plates due to a given
elasticity, span, and size of plate?_

_Answer._ BY MULTIPLYING THE CUBE OF THE SPAN IN INCHES BY 1.66; THEN
MULTIPLYING THE ELASTICITY IN SIXTEENTHS BY THE BREADTH OF PLATE IN
INCHES, AND BY THE CUBE OF THE THICKNESS IN SIXTEENTHS: DIVIDE THE
FORMER PRODUCT BY THE LATTER. THE QUOTIENT IS THE NUMBER OF PLATES.

QUESTION 295. _How can we find the working strength, that is the
greatest weight it should bear in practice, of a given steel-plate
spring?_

_Answer_. BY MULTIPLYING THE BREADTH OF PLATES IN INCHES BY THE SQUARE
OF THE THICKNESS IN SIXTEENTHS, AND BY THE NUMBER OF PLATES; MULTIPLY,
ALSO, THE WORKING SPAN IN INCHES BY 11.3: DIVIDE THE FORMER PRODUCT
BY THE LATTER. THE RESULT IS THE WORKING STRENGTH IN TONS (OF 2,240
POUNDS) BURDEN.

QUESTION 296. _How can we find the span due to a given strength, and
number and size of plate?_

_Answer_. BY MULTIPLYING THE BREADTH OF PLATE IN INCHES BY THE SQUARE
OF THE THICKNESS IN SIXTEENTHS, AND BY THE NUMBER OF PLATES; MULTIPLY,
ALSO, THE STRENGTH IN TONS BY 11.3: DIVIDE THE FORMER PRODUCT BY THE
LATTER. THE RESULT IS THE WORKING SPAN IN INCHES.

QUESTION 297. _How can we find the number of plates due to a given
strength, span and size of plates?_

_Answer_. BY MULTIPLYING THE STRENGTH IN TONS BY THE SPAN IN INCHES,
AND BY 11.3; MULTIPLY ALSO, THE BREADTH OF PLATE IN INCHES BY THE
SQUARE OF THE THICKNESS IN SIXTEENTHS: DIVIDE THE FORMER PRODUCT BY THE
LATTER. THE RESULT IS THE NUMBER OF PLATES.

QUESTION 298. _How can we find the required amount of curvature or set
of the spring before it is loaded?_

_Answer._ BY MULTIPLYING THE ELASTICITY, PER TON, IN INCHES, BY THE
WORKING STRENGTH IN TONS; ADD THE PRODUCT TO THE DESIRED WORKING
COMPASS. THE SUM IS THE WHOLE ORIGINAL SET, TO WHICH AN ALLOWANCE OF
¹⁄₈ TO ³⁄₈ IN. SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE PERMANENT SETTING OF THE SPRING.

QUESTION 299. _How are the spring-hangers attached to the ends of the
springs?_

_Answer._ A great variety of methods have been used. The most common
ones are those shown in fig. 169. There the hanger embraces the spring
at the ends, _g_, _g_, (shown on an enlarged scale at _a_, in figs.
176 and 177.) The end of the spring has two projections forged on its
end to receive the upper end of the hanger, which is made to fit the
groove thus formed between the two projections. The other end, _b_,
of the spring, figs. 176 and 177, has an eye cut in it which receives
the hanger _b_. The latter is made of a single bar, and also has an
eye, _c_, to receive a key which sustains the weight suspended on the
hanger _b_. The back end of the front springs and the front end of the
back springs are made in this way because they come on the side of the
fire-box, and if their width was increased by the thickness of the
hanger, as shown at _a_ in fig. 177, it would rub against and wear the
outer shell of the fire-box.

QUESTION 300. _How are the lower ends of the hangers attached?_

_Answer._ The front hanger, _g_, fig. 169, of the front spring, and the
back hanger, _g_, of the back spring have eyes and pins in their lower
ends, _k_, as shown in the engraving. The pins are supported by rubber
springs, _l_, _l_, which are held between two concave castings, _n_,
_k_, one of each of which rests against the frames. The object of the
rubber springs is to relieve the spring-hangers from sudden shocks and
strains. The benefit derived from their use is believed to be purely
imaginary, as the spring itself, if sufficiently elastic, should absorb
the sudden shocks which the wheels and axles will convey to the hangers.

QUESTION 301. _Why are the ends g′, g′ of the springs attached to the
lever_[75] _A A?_

  [75] This lever is called an _equalizing lever_ or _beam_, or, more
  briefly, an _equalizer_.

_Answer._ Because if there is a spring for every axle and the hangers
are fastened to the frame, then evidently the locomotive has as many
points of support as it has axle-boxes. Every shock from the rails is
transferred through the wheel and the axle to the nearest axle-box
and the spring belonging to it, and the latter must be made strong
enough to receive and dispose of the whole of it. If the adjacent
hangers, _g′_, _g′_, fig. 169, of the adjoining springs, _B_ and _B′_,
are connected by an equalizing lever, _A A_, which turns on the fixed
point _C_, then the shock which affects one wheel will be transferred
first to the corresponding spring. From this spring a part of the shock
will be transferred to the frame by the hanger _g_, and a part by the
hanger _g′_ to the equalizer, which will transfer the pressure to the
adjoining spring _B′_. If by some unevenness of the road or a powerful
oscillation of the locomotive, a spring is momentarily burdened, the
equalizer thus causes the next wheel to receive part of this load.

The advantages of this arrangement are evident: since the springs have
to receive only a part of the shocks, they can be made less strong and
therefore more flexible. The danger of running off the track and that
of breaking axles, springs and hangers, is therefore reduced by the use
of equalizing levers.

QUESTION 302. _How are the equalizing levers constructed?_

_Answer_. They are made of wrought iron and are supported in the centre
by a fulcrum, _C_, which is fastened to the frame or boiler or both.
The spring-hangers _g′, g′_ are usually attached to the lever by eyes
and keys. Sometimes eyes are made in the lever, as shown in fig. 169,
and the hanger is inserted into the eye and held either with a key or
else with projections which are forged on the hanger below the lever.
In other cases the hangers are made with an eye which embraces the end
of the lever.

QUESTION 303. _How is the distribution of weight of the engine affected
by the equalizing levers?_

_Answer_. The weight is equally distributed on all the driving-wheels.
This is apparent if it is observed that the weight suspended from each
of the spring-hangers of each spring in fig. 169 must be the same; for
if the weights in the two hangers, _g′_ and _g′_, were unequal, then
the end of the spring which supports the heaviest weight would be drawn
down until the pressure was equalized. If the weights suspended from
the two hangers, _g′_ and _g′_, attached to the equalizing lever were
unequal, then the one supporting the greatest load would draw up its
end of the equalizer until the weights were again in equilibrium.

[Illustration: _Fig. 184._

_Fig. 185._

Scale ³⁄₈ in. = 1 foot.]

Another effect of the equalizing levers is that each side of the
locomotive is supported in such a way that the action is the same as
it would be if it was supported on one point. If, for example, we
have a heavy beam, say a piece of timber like that shown by _A B_,
fig. 184, suspended at one point, _C_, in its centre, to the middle,
_a_, of a long spring, _D E_, the ends of which rest on two supports,
_F_ and _G_, it is evident that if the point of suspension is at the
middle, _C_, of the timber and _a_ of the spring, the weight of the
timber will rest equally on the two supports, _F_ and _G_, and that
the ends of the timber can move up or down or vibrate about the point
of suspension, _C_, without affecting the distribution of weight on
the supports, _F_ and _G_. If, now, the timber is suspended from three
points, _A_, _C_ and _B_, fig. 185, that is, its middle and two ends,
as shown in fig. 185, the ends, _A_ and _B_, being attached to the ends
of the springs _b c_ and _d e_, the latter resting on the supports _F_
and _G_, and connected at their opposite ends to an equalizer, _f g_,
whose fulcrum is at _a_, it is evident that each of the end hangers
must support one-half of that part of the weight of the timber between
it and the middle, and that the centre hanger must support one-half
the weight between the middle and the two ends. Thus the hanger _A b_
must support one-half the weight of the timber between _A_ and _C_,
and _B e_ must support one-half of that between _B_ and _C_; in other
words, the end hangers would each sustain one-fourth of the weight of
the timber and the middle one-half of its weight. If the weight of
the timber is 1,000 pounds, the end hangers would each sustain 250
and the middle one 500 pounds. The weight of the middle of the timber
is hung on the equalizer, and one-half, or 250 pounds of it is thus
transferred to each of its ends _f_ and _g_, and thence to the hangers
_f c_ and _g d_, and thus to the springs, so that the ends, _c_ and
_d_, of the springs, sustain a weight of 250 pounds, therefore, as the
opposite ends also sustain the same weight, it is evident that each
of the springs bears a total load of 500 pounds, or one-half of the
weight of the timber, which is the same load they sustained in fig.
164. If the ends of a timber supported as shown in fig. 185 are moved
up or down about the centre point of suspension, it is evident that
the distribution of weight would not be affected any more than it was
in fig. 164 by a similar movement, because if the ends of the timber
move as shown by the dotted lines around the centre point of suspension
_C_, the end _A_ will ascend as much as _B_ descends. The same thing
is true of the ends _b_ and _e_ of the springs and of their opposite
ends _c_ and _d_, and also of the ends of the equalizer, so that when
the timber, springs and equalizer are in the position shown by the
dotted lines, it is in equilibrium, just as it was when the timber
was horizontal; and therefore the weight on the supports is the same
in both cases, thus showing that the load _A B_ can move about the
centre of suspension when supported as shown in fig. 185 as freely as
it can if arranged as shown in fig. 184. It therefore follows that in
the distribution of the weight of each side of the locomotive on the
wheels and on the track, it may be regarded the same as though it was
supported at one point, which is the fulcrum of the equalizing-lever.

QUESTION 304. _What advantage results from supporting the weight of the
back part of the locomotive on two points?_

_Answer_. If the back part of the locomotive rests on only two points
and the front end on the centre of the truck, then the whole weight
of the engine will be sustained on three points. Now it is a well
known fact that any tripod, like that on which an engineer’s level is
mounted, or a three-legged stool, will adjust itself to any surface,
however uneven, and stand firmly in any position; whereas if there are
more than three points of support, if they are all of the same length
the surface on which they rest must be a plane, otherwise some of them
will not touch. All railroad tracks have inequalities of surface, and
therefore it is of the utmost importance that a locomotive should be
able to adjust itself on its points of support to any unevenness of the
track on which it must run. This is possible only when the weight rests
on three points of support.

_Fig. 188._

_Scale, ³⁄₈ inch = 1 foot._]

QUESTION 305. _How is the truck constructed?_

_Answer_. It consists, as has already been stated, of two pairs of
wheels.[76] These are attached to a frame, _b′ b′_, plates I, II and
III. The axles have boxes called _truck-boxes_, and brass bearings
similar to those used on the driving-axles. These boxes work in jaws,
also similar to those on the main engine frame, excepting that they
have no attachment to prevent them from being worn by the motion of
the boxes up and down in the jaws. Fig. 186 is a horizontal section,
fig. 187 a plan, and fig. 188 a transverse section[77] of a truck. The
frame _C D E F_, fig. 187, shown also at _h′ h′_, figs. 186 and 188, is
of rectangular form and is forged in one piece. The legs _f f_ which
form the jaws for the boxes, are bolted to the frame as shown in fig.
186. To the lower end of these legs a brace, _g g g_, is bolted, which
thus unites them together. On each side one spring, _S F S_, is placed
under the frame and in the reverse or inverted position to that of
the driving-springs. A pair of equalizing levers, _G G G_, is placed
on each side of the truck, one of them on the inside of the frame and
the other on the outside, as shown in the plan. The ends of these
equalizers rest on the top of the truck-boxes, and the springs are
attached to the levers at _i i_ by the hangers, _j j_. The truck-frame
rests on the top of the spring-strap, _F_, which is made of the form
of an arc of a circle, or “_rounded_,” as it is termed by workmen, so
that it can move freely about the point of support. It is evident that
this arrangement of spring and equalizer operates in the same way as
that employed for the driving-wheels in distributing the weight on each
of the wheels, and that the truck-frame is supported on two points,
_k_, _k_, figs. 186 and 187. The weight of the front end of the engine
rests on a cast iron _centre-plate_, _H H_. This centre-plate rests
on four bars, _l l_, _l l_, and _m m, m m_, two of which are bolted
to the frame transversely and the other two longitudinally, as shown
in the plan. These bars are elevated in the centre as shown in figs.
186 and 188. The transverse bars are trussed with two corresponding
bars, _n n_, fig. 188, below. These _truss-bars_ as they are called,
are bolted to the upper bars with bolts, _o_, _o_, but are separated
from the top-bars by distance pieces, _P_, _P_, figs. 186 and 188.
The centre-plate _H H_, called the _lower centre-plate_, has an
annular groove in it, which receives a corresponding projection on
the casting _K K_, called the _upper centre-plate_, which is bolted
to the bed-plate of the cylinders, as shown in plate II. The upper
centre-plate has a pin, _y_, called a _centre-pin_, fig. 186 and plate
II, attached to it, which passes through the lower centre-plate, and
has a key underneath the latter plate. This key is intended to prevent
the engine from “jumping” off of the truck on a rough track or in case
of accident. The annular groove and the projection which fits into it
are intended to receive the strain which otherwise would bear against
the centre-pin and would be liable to break or bend it.

  [76] In some rare cases three pairs of wheels are employed for
  locomotive trucks. Six-wheeled trucks are very commonly used under
  passenger cars.

  [77] The right half is a section through the centre of the axle, or
  of _G g_, of fig. 186, and the left half a section through the centre
  of the truck, or on _g g_, of fig. 186.

From this description it will be seen that while the truck-frame rests
on two points, _k_ and _k_, the weight of the engine is supported by
the centre-plate of the truck. As the back part substantially rests
on the centres of the two equalizers, it will be seen that this
distribution of the weight fulfills the conditions of the tripod, or as
it has been called, the “_three-legged principle_.”

_Fig. 190._

_Fig. 191._

Scale ³⁄₈ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 306. _How are trucks arranged so as to give them lateral
motion?_

_Answer._ When this is done, the lower centre-plate is usually
suspended in some way from the truck-frame on links or hangers, so that
it can swing laterally. One method of doing this is shown in figs. 189,
190 and 191. Fig. 190 is a front view, fig. 191 a plan, and fig. 189 a
transverse section of such an arrangement. The centre-plate _H H_ has
cast with it an extension, _B B_, the ends of which are suspended on
links, _L_, _L_, called _suspension-links_, the upper ends of which are
attached to bars, _m_, _m_, which are set edgeways and extend across
the truck-frames. It is evident that with this arrangement the lower
centre casting can swing crosswise of the track on the links _L_, _L_,
and that the front end of the engine will thus have a lateral motion
independent of the truck.




PART XIII.

ADHESION AND TRACTION.


QUESTION 307. _What is meant by the “adhesion” of a locomotive?_

_Answer._ It is the resistance which prevents or opposes the slipping
of the driving-wheels on the rails, and is due to the friction of the
former on the latter.

QUESTION 308. _On what does the amount of this friction depend?_

_Answer._ Like all friction it depends upon the weight or pressure of
the surfaces in contact, and consequently upon the load which rests
on each wheel. It also depends upon the condition of the rails, and
probably to some extent upon the material of which they and the tires
on the wheels are made.

[Illustration: _Fig. 192._

Scale ¹⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 309. _How much force is required to make the driving-wheels of
a locomotive slip on an ordinary railroad track?_

_Answer._ The force required to make them slip will, as already stated,
vary very much with the condition of the rails. If they are quite dry
and clean it will require a force equal to about one-fourth the weight
on the wheels. That is, supposing we have a wheel, _A B_, fig. 192,
attached to a frame which is fastened so that it cannot move, and
that the wheel rests on a rail and is loaded with say 10,000 pounds,
if now a rope or chain could be attached at a point, _B_, exactly at
the tread of the wheel, and carried over a pulley, _C_, then it would
require a weight, _D_, of about 2,500 pounds attached to the end of the
rope to make the wheel slip. If the rails were sanded, the adhesion
would be somewhat greater, and if they were wet or muddy or greasy,
considerably less. For ordinary circumstances the adhesion may safely
be assumed to be _one-fifth of the weight of the driving-wheels_. Of
course the total weight on all the driving-wheels must be taken in
calculating the adhesion. Thus, if a locomotive has four driving-wheels
and each one of them bears a load of 10,000 pounds, then the total
weight on the driving-wheels, or _adhesive weight_, as it is called,
will be 10,000 × 4 = 40,000 pounds, and the adhesion will be

  40,000
  ------ = 8,000 pounds.
     5

QUESTION 310. _What is meant by the tractive power of a locomotive?_

_Answer._ It is the force with which the locomotive is urged in a
horizontal direction by the pressure of the steam in the cylinders, and
which therefore tends to move the locomotive and draw the load attached
to it.

The tractive power is of course due to the pressure of steam on the
piston, and therefore its amount is dependent upon the average steam
pressure in the cylinder, on the area of the piston, and also on the
distance through which the pressure is exerted, or, in other words,
on the stroke of the piston. Thus if we have a cylinder 16 inches in
diameter and two feet stroke and an average steam pressure of 50 pounds
per square inch, then as the area of such a piston would be 201 square
inches, the average pressure on it would be 201 × 50 = 10,050 pounds,
and as each piston moves through four feet during one revolution of
the wheels, the number of foot-pounds of energy exerted by it would be
10,050 × 4 = 40,200, and for the two cylinders of a locomotive double
that amount, or 80,400 foot-pounds. Now if the driving-wheels are five
feet in diameter, their circumference will be 15.7 feet, and therefore
the locomotive will move that distance on the rails during one
revolution, if the wheels do not slip. The 80,400 foot-pounds of energy
is therefore exerted through a distance of 15.7 feet, and therefore

  80,400
  ------ = 5,121 pounds,
   15.7

which is the force exerted through each foot that the circumference of
the wheel revolves and the locomotive moves. If the wheels were only
half the diameter, or 2¹⁄₂ feet, then their circumference would be 7.85
feet and the tractive power would be

  80,400
  ------ = 10,242 pounds,
   7.85

or double what it was before. It will be seen, then, that the tractive
force of a locomotive is dependent upon (1) the average steam pressure
in the cylinders, (2) the area, (3) the stroke of the pistons, and (4)
the diameter of the driving-wheels.

QUESTION 311. _How is the tractive power of a locomotive calculated?_

_Answer._ BY MULTIPLYING TOGETHER THE AREA OF THE PISTON IN SQUARE
INCHES, THE AVERAGE STEAM PRESSURE IN POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH ON THE
PISTON DURING THE WHOLE STROKE, AND FOUR TIMES THE LENGTH OF THE STROKE
OF THE PISTON,[78] AND DIVIDING THE PRODUCT BY THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE
WHEEL. The result will be the tractive power exerted in pounds. The
adhesion must of course always exceed the tractive force, otherwise the
wheels will slip.

  [78] This length may be taken in feet, inches or any other measure,
  but in making the calculation the circumference of the wheel must be
  taken in the _same_ measure as the stroke of the piston.

QUESTION 312. _How is the locomotive made to advance by causing the
wheels to revolve?_

_Answer._ The pressure of steam in the cylinders is exerted in one
direction against the piston, and in the opposite direction against the
cylinder head, as shown in fig. 192, in which the steam is represented
by the dotted shading in the back end of the cylinder, and the
direction of the pressure by the darts _s_, _s_. The pressure against
the piston is communicated by the connecting-rod to the crank-pin _E_,
and that on the cylinder-head is carried to the axle by the frame
_F F′_, and the direction of the two forces is indicated by the two
darts, _a_ and _b_. We may now regard the spokes of the wheels as
acting as levers, and assume that the fulcrum is either at the centre
_G_ of the axle, or at _B_, the point of contact of the wheel with the
rail.[79] We will assume that it is at the centre _G_ of the axle and
for the sake of even figures that the wheel is six feet in diameter and
cylinders have two feet stroke. We will also suppose that the engine is
supported so that the wheels do not touch the rails, and that a chain
or rope passing over a pulley _C_ is attached to the wheels at _B_
and with a weight at _D_. We now have a force, _a_, of 10,000 pounds
exerted on the crank-pin, or at the end of the short arm _E G_ of the
lever _E G B_. As _E G_ is one foot and _G B_ three feet long, 10,000
would be balanced by

  10,000 × 1
  ---------- = 3,333 pounds,
       3

at _B_. In other words, it would require 3,333 pounds suspended from
the chain at _D_ to resist the strain at _E_. But when this is the
case, the pressure of the axle at the fulcrum, in the direction of the
dart _c_, is equal to the pressure against the crank-pin _E_ added
to that exerted by the weight _D_ at _B_, or 10,000 + 3,333 = 13,333
pounds.

  [79] The question whether the centre of the axle or the point of
  contact with the rail is the fulcrum of the lever in this case has
  been the subject of much animated discussion and contention. As
  the word _fulcrum_ means “a point about which a lever moves,” it
  is believed that the dispute is due simply to a difference in the
  meaning assigned to the word fulcrum. If we regard the fulcrum as the
  point which is fixed in relation to the locomotive, then it is at the
  centre of the axle, but if we refer it to the surface of the earth,
  then it is at the top of the rail.

As the pressure against the axle in the opposite direction, _b_, is
only 10,000 pounds, there will be an unbalanced force of 3,333 pounds
acting in the direction of the dart _c_, and tending to move it that
way. As the axle is attached to the locomotive frame, this force will
of course have a tendency to move the whole machine, and is really the
tractive force of the engine.

If, on the other hand, we regard the point of contact _B_ of the wheel
with the rail as a fulcrum, we have a force of 10,000 pounds acting
against a lever, _E G B_, four feet long. There would therefore be a
force, _c_, of

  10,000 × 4
  ---------- = 13,333 pounds
       3

exerted at _G_, and as the pressure in the direction of the dart _b_ is
only 10,000, there would be an unbalanced strain of 13,333 - 10,000 =
3,333 pounds acting against the axle in the direction of the dart _c_,
or, in other words, there is 3,333 pounds more of force pulling the
axle forward than there is pushing it backward.

When the crank-pin is below the axle, in the position shown in fig.
193, then if the centre of the axle is regarded as the fulcrum we have
a pressure of 10,000 pounds pushing against the front cylinder-head,
which is transferred to the axle by the frames, and acts in the
direction of the dart _c_, and we also have a pressure against the
crank-pin _E_ in the direction of the dart _a_. Now 10,000 pounds at
_E_ would exert a force of

  10,000 × 1
  ---------- = 3,333 pounds
      3

at _B_ and

  10,000 × 2
  ---------- = 6,666 pounds
      3

at _G_ in the direction of _b_. But the pressure on the cylinder-head
pulls against the axle _G_ in the direction c with a force of 10,000,
so that the excess of strain in the direction _b_ will be equal to
10,000 - 6,666 = 3,333 pounds. If we regard _B_ as the fulcrum, the
calculation is exactly the same, as 10,000 pounds at _E_ exerts a force
at _G_ equal to

  10,000 × 2
  ---------- = 6,666 pounds,
      3

and the difference between it and the pressure exerted by the strain
against the front cylinder-head is the force which urges the axle and
with it the locomotive forward.

It will be seen, then, that it is immaterial which point is regarded as
the fulcrum, as the result of the calculations is exactly the same.

[Illustration: _Fig. 193._

Scale ¹⁄₄ in. = 1 foot.]

It must not, however, be hastily supposed from what has been said that
the total pressure against the axle can be greater than its resistance
to the pressure. As soon as the one exceeds the other it will move.
But supposing that it requires a force equal to 3,333 pounds to draw
a train coupled to the engine, as soon as the difference between the
force exerted against the axle by the piston to move it forward and
that which presses it back exceeds 3,333 pounds, the locomotive will
move the train. If it continues to exceed it the speed of the train
will be accelerated and thus the resistance which holds the engine back
and that which pushes it forward will always be equal.

QUESTION 313. _Does the fact that the piston is working from the end of
a longer lever E G B, fig. 192, when the crank-pin is above the axle,
enable the locomotive to start a heavier train than when the crank-pin
is below the axle and the piston is working against a shorter lever, G
E B, fig. 193?_

_Answer._ No; because, as has already been shown, the pressure against
the axle is the same in both cases. It is in fact only during the
forward stroke that the pressure on the crank-pin moves the engine
forward. The forward pressure which is exerted by the crank-pin at
the axle is then greater than that exerted against the latter in the
opposite direction by the cylinder-head and frames. It is this excess
of crank pressure which moves the engine and which is the tractive
force during the forward stroke. During the backward stroke the piston
is pushing the axle backward, and the pressure against the front
cylinder-head is pulling it forward. The latter then exceeds the
former, and the difference between the two is the force which moves the
engine forward. As has been shown, this difference is the same in both
positions of the crank, and therefore the locomotive can not from this
cause pull more when the crank is above the axle than when it is below.




PART XIV.

INTERNAL DISTURBING FORCES IN THE LOCOMOTIVE.


QUESTION 314. _What are the internal disturbing forces in a locomotive?_

_Answer._ They are: 1, the momentum of the parts which have a
reciprocating motion; 2, those due to the varying pressure of the
steam in the cylinder-heads; 3, those caused by the thrust of the
connecting-rods against the guide-bars; and 4, those produced by
unbalanced revolving parts.

QUESTION 315. _How can the effects of these disturbing forces be
neutralized?_

_Answer._ By putting counterweights, _A_, _A_, fig. 161, in the
driving-wheels opposite the crank-pins. The motion of these will then
be in the reverse direction to that of the weight of the parts attached
to the crank-pins, and the motion of the one will thus, to some extent,
at least, neutralize the disturbing influence of the other.

QUESTION 316. _Can the weight of these counterweights be calculated for
any locomotive?_

_Answer._ It can probably be calculated, but it is an exceedingly
complicated problem, and one about which there is much difference
of opinion. The difficulty is also increased by the fact that
while counterweights may be heavy enough for one speed, they may
be too heavy or too light for a slower or faster speed, and quite
disproportioned when the engine is not working steam. The following
rules are given in “Clark’s Railway Machinery,” and are perhaps
sufficiently close to find a first approximation to the requisite
position and weight of the counterweights; but the final adjustment
should be made by trial. This can be done by suspending the locomotive
by chains attached to the four corners of its frame, and setting the
machinery in motion at the speed it is intended to run. By attaching
a pencil to one or to each of the four corners of the frame, and
arranging it so that it will mark on a horizontal fixed card, a diagram
will be drawn, being usually an oval, which will show the amount and
form of the oscillations. The counterweights can then be adjusted so
that the diagram drawn by the pencil is reduced to the least possible
size. When the adjustment is successful, the diameter of the diagram
is reduced to about ¹⁄₁₆ of an inch.[80] Another and simpler, but less
accurate, way is to place a pail or other vessel filled with water on
the front of the engine and run the locomotive on a smooth track at a
high speed, and adjust the counterweights so that the least amount of
water will be spilled.

  [80] Rankine’s Treatise on the Steam Engine.

QUESTION 317. _How can the centre of gravity of a counterweight in one
segment be found?_

_Answer._ BY CUTTING A WOODEN TEMPLET OF UNIFORM THICKNESS TO THE FORM
OF THE SURFACE, AND FREELY SUSPENDING IT BY ONE OF THE CORNERS, _a_,
AS IN FIG. 194; A PLUMMET-LINE, _P a_, DROPPED FROM THE SAME POINT OF
SUSPENSION IN FRONT OF THE TEMPLET WILL INTERSECT THE CENTRE LINE _b
c_ AT THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY _C_.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 194._]

QUESTION 318. _How can the centre of gravity of a counterweight in
three segments be found?_

_Answer._ FIND THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY _C_, FIG. 195, OF ONE OF THE
COUNTERWEIGHTS, AS ABOVE; THROUGH _C_ STRIKE AN ARC FROM THE CENTRE,
_a_, OF THE WHEEL, CROSSING THE CENTRE LINES OF THE OTHER SEGMENTS AT
THEIR CENTRES, _C′ C″_; DRAW _C′ C″_ MEETING _A B_ AT _D_, AND SET OFF
_D E_, ONE-THIRD OF THE INTERVAL _D C_. THEN _E_ IS THE COMMON CENTRE
OF GRAVITY OF THE THREE SEGMENTS.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 195._]

QUESTION 319. _How can the centre of gravity of a counterweight in two
segments be found?_

_Answer._ This is required when the crank is opposite to a spoke, as in
fig. 196. FIND THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY, _C_, OF ONE SEGMENT AS BEFORE,
AND BY AN ARC FIND THE OTHER CENTRE _C′_; DRAW _C C′_, CUTTING _A B_ AT
_D_, WHICH IS THE COMMON CENTRE OF GRAVITY.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 196._]

QUESTION 320. _How can the centre of gravity of a counterweight in four
segments be found?_

_Answer._ FIND, AS BEFORE, THE CENTRES _C_, _C′_, _C″_, _C‴_, FIG.
197, OF THE SEGMENTS; DRAW _C″ C′_ AND _C‴ C_, CUTTING THE LINE _A B_;
BISECT THE INTERVAL SO INCLOSED AT _E_ FOR THE COMMON CENTRE OF GRAVITY.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 197._]

QUESTION 321. _How is the counterweight for outside-cylinder engines
with a single pair of driving-wheels calculated?_

_Answer._ FIND THE TOTAL WEIGHT, IN POUNDS, OF THE REVOLVING AND
RECIPROCATING MASSES FOR ONE SIDE, NAMELY, THE PISTON AND APPENDAGES,
CONNECTING-ROD, CRANK-PIN AND CRANK-PIN BOSS; MULTIPLY BY THE LENGTH OF
CRANK IN INCHES, AND DIVIDE BY THE DISTANCE IN INCHES OF THE CENTRE OF
GRAVITY OF THE SPACE TO BE OCCUPIED BY THE COUNTERWEIGHT. THE RESULT
IS THE COUNTERWEIGHT IN POUNDS, TO BE PLACED EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO THE
CRANK.

Question 322. _How is the counterweight for outside-cylinder engines
with coupled driving-wheels calculated?_

_Answer_. FIND THE SEPARATE REVOLVING WEIGHTS, IN POUNDS, OF CRANK-PIN,
CRANK-PIN BOSS, COUPLING-RODS AND CONNECTING-ROD, FOR EACH WHEEL, ALSO
THE RECIPROCATING WEIGHT OF THE PISTON AND APPENDAGES, AND HALF THE
CONNECTING-ROD; DIVIDE THE RECIPROCATING WEIGHT EQUALLY BETWEEN THE
COUPLED WHEELS, AND ADD THE PART, SO ALLOTTED, TO THE REVOLVING WEIGHT
ON EACH WHEEL; THE SUMS SO OBTAINED ARE THE WEIGHTS TO BE BALANCED AT
THE SEVERAL WHEELS, FOR WHICH THE NECESSARY COUNTERWEIGHT MAY BE FOUND
BY THE PRECEDING RULE.

Question 323. _How are the counterweights constructed?_

_Answer_. They are usually made of cast iron, so as to fill or partly
fill the spaces between the spokes of the wheel, as shown at _A A_ in
fig. 161. Each of the segments consists of two pieces, one of which is
put in from the outside of the wheel and the other from the inside.
The two are then bolted together with bolts, which are shown in the
above figure. In some cases the counterweights are cast solid with the
wheels, and in others, cavities are cast in the wheels which are filled
with lead, which is poured in when melted. Some locomotive builders
make the rims and spokes of the wheels hollow and fill them with lead
opposite to the crank-pins. It is difficult, however, to get the
required weight in such wheels unless they are of large diameter.

QUESTION 324. _What effect has the strain on the draw-bar, when the
engine is pulling a load, upon the distribution of the weight on the
wheels?_

_Answer_. It has the effect of pulling the back end of the engine
down, and, as it is balanced on the fulcrums of the equalizing levers,
it at the same time lifts up the front end. In this way the harder a
locomotive is pulling the greater will be the weight which is thrown
on the driving-wheels, and that on the truck will be correspondingly
diminished. The higher the draw-bar is above the rails the greater will
be the tendency to pull the engine down behind and up in front.




PART XV.

MISCELLANEOUS.


QUESTION 325. _What is the sand-box, V, plates I and II for, and how is
it constructed?_

_Answer_. It is intended to carry a supply of dry sand, which is
scattered on the rails in front of the driving-wheels when the latter
are liable to slip. This is done by two pipes, _e′, e′_, plate I, one
on each side of the engine. They lead from the sand-box to within a few
inches of the rail. At the upper end and inside the sand-box they each
have a valve which is operated by a lever which is connected to the cab
by a rod which enables the locomotive runner to open or close the valve
at pleasure.

The sand-box is usually made of sheet iron with a cast iron base, and a
top of a more or less ornamental design. It also has an opening on top
through which the sand is supplied to the box. This opening has a loose
cover to exclude rain and dirt from the sand. The sand-box is usually
located on top of the boiler in front of the front driving-wheels.

QUESTION 326. _What is the bell U for?_

_Answer_. It is used for giving signals of the starting or approach of
the engine. It also is located on top of the boiler and is usually hung
on a cast iron frame and rung with a rope connecting it with the cab.

QUESTION 327. _What is the weight of an ordinary locomotive bell?_

_Answer_. From 50 to 100 pounds.

QUESTION 328. _What is a locomotive head-light?_

_Answer_. It is a large lamp, _T_, plates I and II, placed in front of
the locomotive to signal its approach at night and also to illuminate
the track for the locomotive runner.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 198._

Scale 1¹⁄₂ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 329. _How is a head-light constructed?_

_Answer_. The lamp has what is called an Argand burner; that is, a
burner with a hollow cylindrical wick, through the centre of which a
current of air circulates, which thus supplies the flame with a larger
quantity of air than is possible if the latter can come in contact with
the former only from the outside. The result is that the combustion
is much more brilliant than with ordinary burners. In order to throw
all the light on the track the burner is placed inside of a concave
reflector, _a b c_, fig. 198, which is of a _parabolic_ form. One of
the peculiarities of this form of reflector is that if a light is
placed in its focus _f_ the rays will be reflected from its surface
in parallel lines. Thus, let _a b c_, fig. 198, represent a section
of such a reflector. Now, if a light be placed in the focus _f_ the
rays will strike against the reflector, be thrown in the direction of
the dotted lines _f 1 x, f 2 x ... f 9 x_, etc., and thus be thrown
directly in front of the engine. The reflectors are usually made of
copper and plated with silver.

The lamps and reflectors for head-lights are inclosed in a rectangular
case which is supported on two brackets bolted to the front of the
smoke-box. On these brackets a wooden shelf is fastened on which the
head-light rests.

QUESTION 330. _What are the running-boards and hand-rails?_

_Answer_. The _running-boards_ are planks, _i i_, plate I, placed on
each side of the boiler to enable the locomotive runner or fireman to
go from the cab to the front end of the engine when it is running. The
hand-rails, _m m′ m′_, are brass or iron pipes attached to the top of
the boiler and extending from the cab to the smoke-box, and are placed
there, as their name indicates, to support or for a hand-hold for
persons on the running-board.

QUESTION 331. _What provision is made for removing from the track
such obstacles as cattle or fallen rocks, which may be in front of
locomotives?_

_Answer_. What is called a _cow-catcher_ or _pilot_, _S_, plates I
and II, is attached to the front of the locomotive. This is usually
made of wood, and consists of a triangular frame at the bottom which
is supported about four inches above the tops of the rails. Straight
pieces of wood of about 2¹⁄₂ × 4 inches section are fastened to
this frame and also to a horizontal piece which is bolted to the
bumper-timber _E′_. These pieces arranged in this way and only a few
inches apart give to the cow-catcher a peculiar curved form somewhat
resembling that of the mould-board of a plow, which is very well
adapted for throwing any obstacles from the track. Sometimes these
pieces are placed horizontally instead of being inclined up and
down. Cow-catchers are also in some cases made of round iron bars or
angle iron. They are always bolted securely to the bumper-timber and
strengthened by strong iron braces attached to the bottom frame at the
front and back. These braces are usually fastened at the other end to
the bumper-timber, but are sometimes attached to the bed-plates of the
cylinder.

There is also usually a strong _pushing-bar_ attached with a bolt and
hinged joint to the bumper-timber. This is shown in plates II and III
in the position it occupies when not in use. It is used in pushing
cars, as very often there is not room for the pilot under the end of
the car. In using it is raised up, and the front end is then coupled to
the draw-head of the car.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 199._]

QUESTION 332. _What is the foot-board or foot-plate of a locomotive?_

_Answer_. It is a wrought or cast iron plate which extends across and
rests upon the two frames at the back part of the locomotive and behind
the boiler, and on which the locomotive runner and fireman stand. It
also unites the two frames very securely, and furnishes an attachment
for the draw-bar. The foot-board is often made much heavier than is
necessary for strength, in order to increase the weight, and thus the
adhesion, on the driving-wheels. It is a fact often not suspected
that any weight placed on the back end of an ordinary locomotive will
increase the load on the driving-wheels by an amount considerably
greater than that of the weight itself. The reason of this is that the
locomotive rests on the centre of the truck and the centres of the
equalizers, and therefore the weight, if applied to the back end of the
engine, gains considerable leverage. This will be clear if we take a
beam, _A B_, and rest it on two supports, _m_ and _n_, fig. 199. If now
we put a weight _W_ on the end, overhanging the point of support, the
weight which will rest on _n_ will be equal to that of _W_ multiplied
by its distance _C_ from _m_ and divided by the distance _D_ between
_m_ and _n_. Thus if a foot-board weighs 1,000 pounds, and its centre
of gravity is 5¹⁄₂ feet behind the centre of the equalizer, and the
latter 14 feet from the centre of the truck, then the weight thrown on
the driving-wheels will be equal to

  1,000 × 19¹⁄₂
  ------------- = 1,393 pounds.
       14

The same thing is of course true of any other weight placed on the back
end of the engine.

QUESTION 333. _What are the “wheel-guards” of a locomotive?_

_Answer_. They are sheet iron covers over the upper half of the
periphery or tread of the wheels, and are placed there to protect the
engine from the dirt and mud which adhere to the wheels and are then
thrown off on the machinery by the centrifugal force.

QUESTION 334. _What are “check” or “safety chains?”_

_Answer_. There are two kinds of such chains, the one attached to
the trucks and frames of the locomotive and the tender. The object
of these chains is to prevent the trucks from turning around and
getting crosswise of the track if the trucks should leave the rails.
The other kind of safety chains connects the engine to the tender,
so that, in case the draw-bar or coupling-pins should break, the two
will not separate. Great care should be exercised to attach the truck
chains so as to be strong enough to resist the strains to which they
will be subjected in case the trucks run off the track. The grossest
carelessness and ignorance are often shown in the construction of these
parts.




PART XVI.

SCREW-THREADS, BOLTS AND NUTS.


QUESTION 335. _How must the screws of bolts and nuts be made, in order
to fit each other?_

_Answer_. Each size of screw must be made of exactly the same diameter,
and their threads of the same form and proportions and _pitch_.

QUESTION 336. _What is meant by the “pitch” of a thread?_

_Answer_. It is the distance the thread progresses lengthwise of the
screw in one revolution. Thus if a single-threaded screw has one-eighth
of an inch pitch, it means that the threads are ¹⁄₈ of an inch apart
measured from the centre of one thread to the centre of that next to
it, and therefore there are eight threads to each inch in length of the
screw.

QUESTION 337. _What is meant by a “single-threaded” screw?_

_Answer_. It means a screw with but one thread instead of two or
more. Thus if we take a string and wind it around a pencil, it will
represent a single-threaded screw, and if we take two or three strings
and wind them parallel to each other, they will represent a double or
treble-threaded screw. The latter kinds are seldom or never used on
locomotives, so that in the following discussion only single-threaded
screws will be referred to.

[Illustration: Fig. 200.

Full Size.]

QUESTION 338. _What is the usual form of the threads of screws?_

_Answer_. The most common is what is called the V-thread, represented
in fig. 200, which is made sharp at both the top and bottom. If such
a thread for one screw is made very pointed and that for another is
blunt, it is plain that the nut for the one will not fit the other
accurately, and also that if a nut has eight threads to the inch, it
will not fit on a bolt with nine. Owing to the fact that, until within
a few years, no common standard has been agreed upon for the form,
proportions or pitch of screws there has been very great diversity in
these respects in the screws which have been used in the construction
of locomotives and other machinery. In 1864 the inconvenience and
confusion from this cause became so great that it attracted the
attention of the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia, and a committee
was appointed by that association to investigate and report on the
subject. That committee recommended the adoption of the Sellers
system of screw-threads and bolts, which was devised by Mr. William
Sellers, of Philadelphia. This same system was subsequently adopted
as the standard by both the Army and Navy Departments of the United
States, and then by the Master Mechanics’ and Master Car Builders’
associations, so that it may now be regarded, and in fact is called,
the United States standard, but the design is due to Mr. Sellers.

QUESTION 339. _In establishing a standard system of screws and threads,
what is the first thing which must be determined?_

_Answer._ The number of threads to the inch, or the pitch of the
threads for screws of different diameters.

[Illustration: Fig. 201. Full size.]

QUESTION 340. _What is the standard for the number of threads to the
inch for the different sized screws of the Sellers system?_

_Answer._ The number of threads with their other proportion is given in
the table at the end of this chapter on page 348.

QUESTION 341. _What is the form of the thread of this standard?_

_Answer._ The form is shown in fig. 201, and is similar to the
V-thread, excepting that it is flattened at the top and bottom.

QUESTION 342. _What are the reasons for the adoption of this form of
thread?_

_Answer._ It has already been pointed out that if a screw is made
with a “blunt” thread it will not fit a nut with very acute or “sharp”
threads; or, if the thread of the bolt was acute and that in the nut
obtuse, they would fit imperfectly. It is therefore necessary in a
standard system to fix upon the angle which the sides of the thread
shall bear to each other. This in the United States standard system was
determined by Mr. Sellers at 60 degrees, because that angle is easily
laid off without special instruments[81] and is perhaps as good as or
better than any other form for the threads.

  [81] This can be done by drawing a circle of any diameter, and
  subdividing the circumference into six equal parts with the radius.
  Lines, drawn from the points of division to the centre will have an
  inclination of 60 degrees to each other.

It is obvious that if a tool is ground with its sides at an angle of 60
degrees to each other, if the point is made sharp after a very little
use it will be worn more or less so that the bottom of the thread will
not be cut perfectly sharp, and therefore it will be difficult to make
bolts and nuts with sharp threads fit each other accurately. It is also
plain that the sharp edge of a thread gives very little strength to the
screw, and yet diminishes that of the bolt very materially. It will
also be impossible to measure the diameter of the screw at the bottom
of the thread if it is made sharp, as its depth will vary as the point
of the tool wears, and it is almost impossible to measure the diameter
of such a screw accurately with ordinary calipers. A sharp-edged thread
in a bolt is also very liable to be injured and bruised by coming in
contact with other objects. To obviate these evils the standard threads
are therefore made flat on the top, and it is evident that a similar
shape at the bottom will give increased strength to the bolt as well
as conform to and fit the thread in the nut. To give this form requires
only that the point of the cutting tool shall be taken off, and then it
is evident this form of thread can be cut in a lathe with the same tool
and in the same manner as the sharp thread. The width of the flat top
and bottom should of course bear a definite proportion to the size or
pitch of the thread.

[Illustration: Fig. 202.]

QUESTION 343. _What are the proportions of the standard threads?_

_Answer_. The rule given by Mr. Sellers for proportioning the thread
is as follows: “DIVIDE THE PITCH, OR, WHAT IS THE SAME THING, THE SIDE
OF THE THREAD, INTO EIGHT EQUAL PARTS; TAKE OFF ONE PART FROM THE TOP
AND FILL IN ONE PART IN THE BOTTOM OF THE THREAD: THEN THE FLAT TOP AND
BOTTOM WILL EQUAL ONE-EIGHTH OF THE PITCH, THE WEARING SURFACE WILL BE
THREE-QUARTERS OF THE PITCH AND THE DIAMETER OF SCREW AT BOTTOM OF THE
THREAD WILL BE EXPRESSED BY THE FORMULA:

     _diameter_ - 1.299
  ------------------------
  _no. threads per inch._”

In order to make the form and proportions of this standard thread as
plain as possible, we have had an enlarged diagram, fig. 202, engraved,
so as to represent the different parts clearly. _x_ represents the
pitch, _d_ the diameter of the screw in inches, _v_ the number of
threads to the inch, _n_ the diameter at bottom of thread, _m_ the
width of back part of thread at the top and bottom, and _s_ the length
of the side of thread.

From Mr. Sellers’ rule the following formulæ can be deduced:

              1.299
  _n_ = _d_ - -----
               _v_

        _x_
  _m_ = ---
         8

        3_x_
  _s_ = ----
          4

From this rule any thread can be constructed, it being only necessary
to know the pitch or number of threads to the inch. This, with all
the dimensions of the standard threads for bolts from ¹⁄₄ to 2 inch
diameter, is given in the table on page 348.

For practical use in the shop a gauge like that shown in fig. 203 will
be found most convenient for grinding the tools to the proper form for
making the standard screws. With this gauge the screw-cutting tool
can first be ground to the proper angle by fitting it to the deepest
notch, and the requisite quantity should then be taken off the point by
fitting it to the notch representing the form of thread for the sized
bolt or number of threads to the inch which it is intended to cut.

Wherever this standard for threads is used, if any pretense at all is
made to accuracy of workmanship, careful attention should be given
to the form and proportion of the threads as well as to the number to
the inch. In buying taps and dies the purchaser should see that they
conform in every respect to the standard, and in making specifications
for new work similar care should be exercised to secure the true
standard, form and proportion of screws. In many shops the workmen who
have the care of those tools are entirely ignorant of the peculiarities
of the Sellers system, and have only the vague idea that so long as
they get the proper number of threads to the inch they are doing all
that is necessary to secure uniformity. Unless, therefore, some care
is exercised to insure accuracy of workmanship in this department, the
adoption of a “standard” for screws will not insure the advantages
which would result from uniformity of screws and threads.

QUESTION 344. _How thick must a nut be, measuring lengthwise of the
bolt, so that the thread in the nut will be of equal strength to that
of the bolt?_

_Answer._ Its thickness must be equal to the outside diameter of the
screw.

PART XVII.

TENDERS.


QUESTION 345. _What are locomotive tenders for?_

_Answer._ They carry a supply of fuel and water for locomotives while
they are running.

QUESTION 346. _How are they usually constructed?_

_Answer._ Their construction is represented in figs. 204, 205 and 206.
Fig. 204 is a side view, fig. 205 a longitudinal section, and fig. 206
a plan of an ordinary tender, which consists of a frame, _A A A A_,
made of wood or iron,[82] mounted on a pair of trucks, _T_, _T_. The
top of the frame is covered with planks, _B_, _B_, which form the floor
of the tender. On top of this floor a sheet-iron tank, _C C C_, is
placed, which carries the supply of water. This tank is made somewhat
in the form of a letter ~⊃~, as shown in the plan. It is made in this
way so that the space between the two branches, _C_, _C_, or “legs,”
as they are called, will give room for fuel. Around the upper edge of
the tank a sheet-iron rim, _D D_, is riveted, so as to prevent the fuel
from falling off when it is filled up above the top of the tank.

  [82] The frame represented in the engraving is made of wood. In the
  plan it is shown by dotted lines.

QUESTION 347. _How is the tank filled with water?_

_Answer._ There is a round opening, _E_, called a _man-hole_, on top.
Into this the end of a leather or canvas hose is introduced, which
is attached to a stationary tank, at a water station, and a stream of
water is then allowed to flow through the hose into the tank of the
tender.

QUESTION 348. _How is the water conducted from the tender to the
engine?_

_Answer._ To each side of the front end of the tank, one end of a piece
of rubber hose, _F F_, is attached, which is connected at the other
end to the pipe on the engine which supplies the pump with water. The
opening inside the tank through which the water flows to the hose is
covered with a valve, which is not shown in the engraving, but which is
operated by a lever or handle, _G_. The valve is covered with a hood
or strainer, perforated with small holes, which is intended to prevent
dirt from entering the hose and thus getting into and obstructing the
pump. The hose is connected to the supply pipe by a screw-coupling
similar to that used with ordinary fire-engine hose.

QUESTION 349. _How are the flat sides of the tank strengthened so as to
resist the pressure and weight of the water?_

_Answer._ They are sometimes braced or stayed with rods or bars, _a_,
_a_, and _h_, _h_, fig. 205, extending from one side to the other and
from the top to the bottom, and angle or ~⊤~ iron is also riveted to
the sides to stiffen them.

QUESTION 350. _How is the tender connected to the engine?_

_Answer._ By the draw-bar, _H_, and coupling-pin, _o_, fig. 205, and
also by the safety chains, _d_.

[Illustration: Fig. 204. Scale ¹⁄₄ inch = 1 foot.]

[Illustration: Fig. 205. Scale ¹⁄₄ inch = 1 foot.]

[Illustration: Fig. 206. Scale ¹⁄₄ inch = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 351. _In what respect do the tender trucks differ from the
engine truck?_

_Answer._ Chiefly in having the journal-bearings and frames outside of
the wheels.

[Illustration: Fig. 207. Scale ³⁄₁₆ in. = 1 inch.]

[Illustration: Fig. 208. Scale ³⁄₁₆ in. = 1 inch.]

QUESTION 352. _Why are the bearings placed outside instead of inside?_

_Answer._ Because they are then more accessible than if they are
inside, and the oil-boxes on the axles can be entirely closed over the
ends of the axles, so that no oil can leak out, whereas if the boxes
are inside, they must be left open at both ends. When the boxes are on
the outside, they can be oiled, or a journal-bearing can be removed and
a new one put in its place, with much less difficulty than if the boxes
were on the inside of the wheels. The only reason why the bearings of
engine truck-axles are placed inside the wheels is because they would
be in the way of the cylinders if they were outside.

QUESTION 353. _How are the axle-boxes for the tender axle constructed?_

[Illustration: Fig. 209. Scale ³⁄₁₆ in. = 1 inch.]

_Answer._ Their construction is similar to that of a car axle-box, the
standard form of which is represented in figs. 207, 208 and 209. Fig.
207 is a section lengthwise of the axle, fig. 208 a section crosswise
of the axle, and fig. 209 a sectional plan. _A_ is the journal of the
axle, which is inclosed by a cast iron box, _K K_, which is open in
front and at the back. The front has a cover, _H_, which is either
fastened by a spring, as shown in the illustrations, or is bolted to
the box. The axle enters the box from the back, _I_, and has either
a wood or leather packing, _J J_, called a _dust-guard_, to keep the
dust from getting in and the oil from leaking out of the box. _D_ is a
brass journal-bearing, which rests against a cast iron bearing piece
or _key_, _E_, which is put in so that by removing it through the
opening _F F_, the brass bearing can be raised up high enough to clear
the collar, _G_, on the end of the axle and thus be removed in the
same way. The lower portion, _L_, of the box under the axle is usually
filled with cotton or woolen waste saturated with oil. This constantly
presses against the axle, and thus keeps it oiled.

QUESTION 354. _How are the tender trucks constructed?_

_Answer._ They are made of various patterns, some of which have wooden
frames and in other cases the frames are made of iron. The truck
illustrated in our engraving, figs. 204 and 205, is made of iron and
is very similar to the engine truck, excepting, as already stated, the
frames are outside instead of inside of the wheels.

QUESTION 355. _How is the tender supported on the trucks?_

_Answer._ It rests on the centre of the front truck and on a bearing,
_n_, fig. 204, on the frames on each side of the back truck. This
arrangement gives three bearing points, the advantages of which have
already been explained. A truck which supports the load which it
carries in the centre is said to be _centre-bearing_, and if the load
is carried on each side, _side-bearing_.

QUESTION 356. _How are the brakes attached to the tender?_

_Answer._ They are attached usually to the back truck alone, but in
some cases to both trucks, and are operated by a wheel, _N_, fig. 204,
and a shaft which extends below the tender frame and on which a chain
attached to the brakes is wound.

QUESTION 357. _How much water and coal does an ordinary tender carry?_

_Answer._ A tender for a thirty-ton engine carries from 1,500 to 2,000
gallons of water and three to four tons of coal, and weighs from
40,000 to 45,000 pounds loaded. An engine of this kind and its tender
therefore weigh about 100,000 pounds, which, being even figures, can
easily be remembered.




PART XVIII.

FRICTION AND LUBRICATION.


QUESTION 358. _What is meant by friction?_

_Answer._ Friction is the resistance between two bodies in contact
which opposes the sliding of the one on the other. Thus if a brick is
placed on a board with a slight inclination, it will not slide because
the friction between them, or the resistance opposed to motion, is
greater than the force exerted by the weight of the brick to move
it downward. If, however, the inclination of the board is increased
sufficiently so that a larger proportion of the weight of the brick
urges it downward, then the friction will be overcome, and it will
slide. When the brake-blocks of a car are pressed against the wheels,
they produce friction, which resists the revolving motion of the wheels
and will ultimately stop the car; and when the weight of an engine
is supported on the driving-wheels and they rest on the rails, the
friction between them, as has already been pointed out, resists their
slipping on each other, and thus enables a locomotive to exert tractive
force. Friction also resists the turning of an axle on its journal and
therefore makes the tractive force of the locomotive necessary to move
a train of cars.

QUESTION 359. _On what does the amount of friction depend?_

_Answer._ The amount of friction of two bodies in contact depends (1)
UPON THE PRESSURE OF THE ONE ON THE OTHER, AND IS INDEPENDENT OF THE
AREA OF THE SURFACES IN CONTACT; (2) ON THE NATURE OF THE MATERIALS
IN CONTACT; (3) ON THE NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE, SUCH AS OIL OR OTHER
LUBRICANT, WHICH IS INTERPOSED BETWEEN THEM. Thus, a brick will slide
down an inclined board as easily if it is laid on its broadest side as
it will if placed edgewise; and if a cast iron plate, say 10 inches
square, is planed and scraped, so as to be as nearly a perfect plane
surface as it is possible to make it, it will, if loaded with say a
hundred pounds weight, slide on a similar true surface as easily as
another plate with half as much area and loaded with the same weight. A
shaft resting against a long bearing will require no more power to turn
it than would be needed if the bearing was short.[83]

  [83] In fact, ordinarily less power is required to turn it if the
  bearing is long than if it is short, the reasons for which will be
  explained hereafter.

QUESTION 360. _What is meant by the “co-efficient of friction?”_

_Answer._ It is the proportion which the resistance to sliding motion
bears to the force pressing the surfaces together. Thus a smooth, clean
and dry cast iron plate loaded with 100 pounds will require a force of
about 15 pounds, or fifteen one-hundredths of the weight or pressure of
the plates, to slide them on each other. The _co-efficient of friction_
is therefore said to be 0.15, and with any other weight or pressure
on the plates we could determine the force required to slide them on
each other by multiplying the pressure by the co-efficient of friction.
Thus, if the plates were loaded with 250 pounds, the force required to
slide the one on the other would be equal to 250 × .15 = 37.5 pounds.
The co-efficient of friction, however, varies for different materials.
Thus, while the co-efficient of friction between two pieces of smooth,
clean and dry cast iron is 0.15, that of a piece of brass on cast iron,
under similar conditions, is 0.22, and of two pieces of wood about 0.4.

QUESTION 361. _What is the effect of introducing some unguent or
lubricating material, such as oil, between the surfaces in contact?_

_Answer._ The co-efficient of friction is very much reduced thereby.
Thus the co-efficient of friction of the cast iron plates, if their
surfaces are greased with tallow, is 0.1; if lubricated with lard 0.07,
with olive oil 0.064, and with lard and plumbago 0.055, thus showing
that the amount of the friction depends very much upon the nature of
the lubricant which is used, as well as on that of the materials in
contact.

QUESTION 362. _What effect on the amount of friction has the manner of
applying the lubricating material to the surfaces in contact?_

_Answer._ The more perfect the lubrication the less will be the
co-efficient of friction. It has, for example, been found by
experiments made with cast iron shafts turning on bearings of the
same material that when the lubricating material was applied so that
the surfaces were only “unctuous,” that is slightly greasy, the
co-efficient of friction was very little less than when they were dry,
that is when there was no lubricating substance between them, and
that when they were greased “from time to time” the co-efficient was
reduced to 0.07 and 0.08; but when they were continually oiled it
averaged 0.05, and sometimes fell as low as 0.025, showing that with
the best lubrication the friction was only one-sixth what it was when
the surfaces were only “unctuous.” Between these two limits there is
every degree of frictional resistance, according to the condition of
lubrication. This shows how important it is that the oiling fixtures
should be kept in the most perfect condition and the utmost care be
exercised in keeping every part of a locomotive thoroughly lubricated.

QUESTION 363. _What effect does the pressure per square inch of the
surfaces in contact have upon the lubrication?_

_Answer._ The tendency is, when this pressure becomes excessive, to
press out the lubricant which is between the two surfaces, and ordinary
experience proves that the greater the weight or the force per square
inch with which two bodies are pressed together, the greater is the
difficulty of keeping them perfectly lubricated.

Thus it is easier to keep the journals of a car well lubricated when
it is empty than when it is heavily loaded, and the guide-bars of a
locomotive are more liable to be cut when the engine is pulling a heavy
load than with a light one.

QUESTION 364. _What effect has the velocity of the surfaces in contact
on the friction and lubrication?_

_Answer._ With the surfaces in the same condition, the friction
is independent of the velocity of motion of the surfaces against
each other, but perfect lubrication becomes more difficult as the
velocity increases, so that an increase of velocity will often
increase indirectly the amount of friction. Thus, taking our previous
illustrations, it is more difficult to keep the journals of a car or
engine well lubricated when running fast than when running slow, and
the same thing is true of the guide-bars.

QUESTION 365. _What considerations should govern the proportions of
frictional bearings for locomotives and other machines?_

_Answer._ The dimensions to be given them should not be determined
from a consideration solely of their resistance to rupture,[84] but
they should be made so large that the pressure they must bear will be
distributed over so much surface that the proportion borne by each
square inch will be comparatively small, thus making good lubrication
much less difficult, and consequently reducing the co-efficient of
friction.

  [84] Morin’s Mechanics.

QUESTION 366. _Is not the amount of energy required to overcome the
friction on a journal of large diameter greater than would be required
if the journal was smaller?_

_Answer._ If the co-efficient of friction in the two cases is the same,
undoubtedly the large journal will require the greatest expenditure
of energy to turn it, because its periphery moves further than that
of the small one; but the advantage attributed to large journals is
that they can be lubricated more perfectly, because their surfaces
being larger the pressure is not so great per square inch, and thus
the gain from the reduction of the co-efficient of friction is greater
than the loss attributable to the increase of the diameter of the
journal. Thus if a car journal is 3¹⁄₄ inches in diameter × 5¹⁄₂ inches
long, the available surface exposed to friction is equal to that of a
longitudinal section of the journal, or 3¹⁄₄ × 5¹⁄₂ = 17.875 square
inches.[85] Supposing now that the journal is loaded with 5,000 pounds,
and the average co-efficient of friction is 0.085. In one revolution
of the wheel the journal will move 0.85 of a foot, and therefore 5,000
× .085 = 361¹⁄₄ foot-pounds of work. If now the journal is made, as
has been proposed, 3³⁄₄ × 7 inches, then its effective surface will
be equal to 26¹⁄₄ square inches, but the journal will move 0.98 of a
foot in one revolution. If, however, the lubrication is improved by the
increased area of the journal so that the co-efficient of friction is
reduced from 0.085 to 0.07, then the energy consumed in one revolution
will be equal to 5,000 × 0.7 × .98 = 343 foot-pounds, or less than
was consumed with the small journals. The co-efficient of friction is
assumed, and could only be determined by experiment, but the assumption
shows how the resistance of the large journals may be less than that
of the small ones. Of course it would be better to give the increased
bearing surface by adding to the length of the journal, but nearly all
locomotives and car journals must be increased in diameter as well
as in length when they are enlarged, in order to have the requisite
strength to carry the loads they must bear.

  [85] The reason for this is that the effective surface of the
  journal _A_, fig. 209. which resists the pressure of the bearing, is
  equivalent only to the horizontal area represented by the dotted line
  _a. b._ just as the surface which resists the pressure inside of a
  boiler is equivalent to the diameter multiplied by its length, as was
  explained in answer to Question 99.

QUESTION 367. _Is the law that_ FRICTION IS IN PROPORTION TO THE
PRESSURE ON EACH OTHER BY THE SURFACES OF CONTACT _true under all
circumstances?_

_Answer._ No; there is a limit to the exactness of the above law, when
the pressure becomes so intense as to crush or grind the parts of the
bodies at and near their surfaces of contact. At and beyond that limit
the friction increases more rapidly than the pressure;[86] and the
friction then becomes very irregular.

  [86] Rankine.

QUESTION 368. _In what cases is the limit referred to probably reached?_

_Answer._ Probably in some locomotives the pressure of the
driving-wheels on the rails is sufficient to partly crush the latter.

QUESTION 369. _What effect has the nature of the materials in contact
on the friction?_

_Answer._ The amount of friction and also the lubrication is very
much influenced by the nature of the bearing surface and also by the
material used as a lubricant. Some metals, such as brass and other
alloys, are much less liable to abrasion and seem to retain lubricants
on their surfaces better than other metals, and are therefore much used
for journal and other bearings. Some substances, especially oils, are
good lubricants, while other materials of apparently similar nature
are not. The reason why these materials possess these properties while
others are without them is not known, and the value of any material
as a lubricant, or the degree to which another will resist friction
without abrasion, can only be tested by experiment.




PART XIX.

COMBUSTION.


QUESTION 370. _What is meant by combustion?_

_Answer_. By combustion is meant the phenomenon ordinarily called
burning, as when a piece of wood or coal or a candle is burnt. In
reality combustion is a union of one of the “_chemical elements_,”
oxygen, of which the atmosphere is composed, with the elements which
constitute the fuel.

QUESTION 371. _What is meant by the term “chemical element?”_

_Answer_. The science of chemistry has demonstrated that nearly all
substances by which we are surrounded are composed of certain other
substances, which latter, as far as is now known, are not compounds,
and are therefore called _elementary substances, or chemical elements_.
Thus the air by which we are surrounded is composed of two gases,
called nitrogen and oxygen; water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen,
and coal chiefly of carbon and hydrogen. There are now over sixty of
these elementary substances known. From no one of them have chemists
been able to extract any material excepting the substance itself. These
elementary substances will combine with others so as to form what is
apparently a new material, but on weighing it it will be found that the
weight of the new material is greater than the original elementary
substance, showing that something was added to it which effected the
change.[87]

  [87] “The New Chemistry,” by J. P. Cooke, Jr.

QUESTION 372. _To what fact is this combination or combustion of
elementary substances due?_

_Answer_. It is owing to the fact--the exact reason for which is
perhaps not yet understood fully--that the atoms of the elementary
substances of which fuel is composed, that is hydrogen and carbon, and
the atoms of oxygen, which forms part of the atmosphere by which we are
surrounded, attract each other with great energy when they are excited
into activity by the application of heat.

QUESTION 373. _What phenomenon always attends chemical combination of
substances?_

_Answer_. Such combination always gives out heat, whereas their
separation absorbs heat. It has further been proved by actual
experiment that the amount of heat liberated by the chemical union
of the same quantity or number of atoms of two or more substances is
always the same, and that when, by any cause, the atoms thus joined are
separated, exactly the same amount of heat is absorbed.[88]

  [88] “The New Chemistry,” by J. P. Cooke, Jr.

QUESTION 374. _In what proportions do the elementary substances combine
with each other?_

_Answer_. It is a law of chemistry that each of the elementary
substances combines with the others in certain definite proportions
only. These proportions vary for the different elements, and have been
determined with great accuracy by chemists. Thus, eight parts by weight
of oxygen will combine with nitrogen and form atmospheric air, or the
same proportion of oxygen will combine with hydrogen and form water,
or with carbon and form carbonic acid, which is the deadly gas which
accumulates at the bottom of wells.

Now oxygen always combines with other substances in the proportion of
eight parts by weight, or by _some simple multiple of_ eight, that is 8
× 2 = 16 parts, or 8 × 3 = 24 parts, etc. Each of the other elementary
substances also has a certain fixed proportion in which it combines
with others, and this proportion, which is usually given by weight, is
represented by a number called its _chemical equivalent_. Thus 8 is
the chemical equivalent of oxygen. Carbon combines with other elements
in proportions of 6 and nitrogen in proportions of 14, so that 6 and
14 are the chemical equivalents of carbon and nitrogen. Now 8 parts by
weight of oxygen can be made to combine with 14 parts of nitrogen, or
8 × 2 = 16 parts of oxygen will combine with 14 of nitrogen, but it is
impossible to make, say 12 parts of oxygen combine with 14 parts of
nitrogen. We can combine 14 × 2 = 28 parts of nitrogen with 8 parts of
oxygen, but no chemical process can make say 10 or 20 parts of nitrogen
combine with 8 parts of oxygen. If 20 parts of nitrogen are mixed with
8 parts of oxygen, then the latter will combine with 14 parts of the
former, but 6 parts of nitrogen will be left, and chemical combination
will then cease.

The following table will give the chemical equivalents of the principal
elements which enter into the process of combustion of the fuel used in
locomotives:

           Chemical
          equivalent
          by weight.

  Oxygen      8
  Nitrogen   14
  Hydrogen    1
  Carbon      6
  Sulphur    16

QUESTION 375. _What effect do the proportions in which elements
are combined have upon the substances which are produced by the
combination?_

_Answer_. A change in the proportions in which the elements are
combined usually alters the entire nature of the substance, so far at
least as it affects our senses. For instance, oxygen unites chemically
with nitrogen in different proportions, forming five distinct
substances, each essentially different from the others, thus:

  14 parts of Nitrogen with  8 of Oxygen forms Nitrous Oxide.
  14   „   „     „      „   16 „    „      „   Nitric Oxide.
  14   „   „     „      „   24 „    „      „   Hyponitrous Acid.
  14   „   „     „      „   32 „    „      „   Nitrous Acid.
  14   „   „     „      „   40 „    „      „   Nitric Acid.

We here find the elements of the air we breathe, by a mere change
in the _proportions_ in which they are united, forming distinct
substances, which differ from each other as much as _laughing gas_
(nitrous oxide) does from that most destructive agent _nitric acid_,
commonly called _aqua fortis_.[89]

  [89] Combustion of Coal and the Prevention of Smoke, by C. Wye
  Williams.

QUESTION 376. _What occurs when a fresh supply of bituminous coal is
thrown on a bright fire in the fire-box of a locomotive?_

_Answer_. The fresh coal is first heated by the fire, and if a
sufficient quantity is thrown in to prevent the immediate formation of
flame,[90] a volume of gas or vapor, usually of a dark yellow or brown
color, is given off. The quantity evolved will be greatest when the
coal is very small. This gas or vapor is commonly called smoke, but
it does not deposit soot and in reality is not true smoke. If a sheet
of white paper be held over the vapor as it escapes from the coal and
there is no flame, the sheet will become slowly coated with a sticky
matter of brown color difficult to remove, and having a strong tarry
or sulphurous smell; whereas if a sheet of paper is held over smoke
it will quickly be covered with black soot. The color and smell left
on the paper in the first case are due to the tarry matter, sulphur,
and other ingredients in the gas. Deprived of the coloring matters,
the vapor is a chemical mixture of 2 parts of hydrogen and 6 parts of
carbon, and is called carburetted hydrogen, and is nearly the same as
the colorless gas by which our houses are lighted.[91] A similar gas is
generated at the wick of a burning candle or lamp and is consumed in
the flame. Before the gas is expelled from the fresh coal the latter
must be heated to a temperature of about 1,200 degrees, so that if
100 pounds at a temperature of 50 degrees is put on the fire 23,000
units of heat will be absorbed to heat the coal.[92] Nor is this all,
as has been explained in answer to Question 38, when any substance is
vaporized a certain amount of heat apparently disappears, which has
been called the _heat of evaporation_ or _of gasification_. Average
bituminous coal contains about 80 per cent. of carbon, 5 per cent.
of hydrogen and 15 per cent. of other substances usually regarded as
impurities. When the coal is heated up to about 1,200 degrees, the 5
per cent. of hydrogen unites with three times its weight of carbon, and
thus 20 per cent. of the coal is converted into the gas described. In
this process a large amount of heat is absorbed or becomes latent, as
it does when water or any other substance is converted into vapor. It
will therefore be seen that the first effect of putting fresh coal on
the fire _is to cool the fire_. This fact has an important bearing on
the question of combustion and will be referred to hereafter.

  [90] Usually if more than two or three shovels full are thrown in
  there will be no immediate formation of flame.

  [92] The quantity of heat required to heat coal is only about
  one-fifth that needed to heat the same weight of water to the same
  temperature.

QUESTION 377. _How can the process of the combustion of the gas
generated from the coal be best explained?_

_Answer_. As this gas is substantially the same as ordinary
illuminating gas, the manner in which it burns can perhaps be made
clearer by examining the combustion of an ordinary gas-light. As stated
before, combustion is a chemical union of the oxygen which forms one
of the elements of the air with the hydrogen and carbon of the fuel,
which, in this case, form gas. It should be clearly kept in mind that
combustion is the result of this union, and that the oxygen is as
essential to combustion as coal or gas, and in fact is the fuel of
combustion just as much as coal or gas is. If we were to conduct a
pipe from the external air into a vessel filled with coal gas we could
_light the air_ and it would burn in the gas as the gas burns in the
air.

It will be noticed, however, that before either the gas or the air will
burn, they must be lighted. Air and gas, even if mixed together in the
same vessel, will not burn unless they are lighted. This can be done by
the flame of any burning material, or with a piece of metal heated to a
very high temperature, or by an electric spark. In other words it may
be said that the atoms of the two gases must be excited into activity
by the application of heat, that is, what is called an _igniting
temperature_ must be communicated to them before chemical combination
will begin. The chief feature which distinguishes combustion from
other chemical union is the circumstance that the heat generated during
the combination is sufficient to maintain an igniting temperature, and
the necessity of doing so in order to continue the process is of very
great importance in the combustion of coal in locomotive boilers, as
will be shown hereafter.

QUESTION 378. _How does an ordinary gas-light burn after it is lighted?_

_Answer_. Under ordinary conditions the hydrogen, which is the most
combustible of the two elements of which coal gas is formed, is the
first to burn. This part of the combustion forms the lower bluish part
of the flame. The combustion of the hydrogen thus separates it from
the carbon, which is then set free; and as carbon is never found in a
gaseous condition when uncombined with other substances, it at once
assumes the form of fine soot when the hydrogen is burned away from it.
This fine soot, or pulverized carbon, is, however, intensely heated by
the combustion of the hydrogen. Now carbon when heated to an igniting
temperature will, if brought into contact with a sufficient quantity
of oxygen, combine with it or be burned. Each particle of carbon thus
becomes a glowing centre of radiation, throwing out its luminous rays
in every direction. The sparks last, however, but an instant, for the
next moment they are consumed by the oxygen which is aroused to full
activity by the heat, and only a transparent gas rises from the flame.
But the same process continues; other particles succeed, which become
heated and ignited in their turn, and it is to this combustion of the
solid particles of carbon that the light which is given out by a
gas-burner or candle is due.[93]

QUESTION 379. _Why does a gas-burner, candle or other flame sometimes
smoke?_

_Answer_. Because the supply of oxygen is then insufficient to consume
the particles of solid carbon which are set free and which then assume
the form of soot. This can be illustrated if we cut a hole in a card,
_d d_, fig. 210, so as to fit over an ordinary gas-burner, _b_. If we
then light the gas and place a glass chimney, _a a_, over the burner
and let it rest on the card, it will be found that the flame will at
once begin to smoke, because very little air can then come in contact
with the flame, and therefore when the fine particles of carbon are
set free by the combustion of the hydrogen, instead of being burned as
they would be if the air with its supply of oxygen were not excluded
from the flame by the chimney, they escape unconsumed in the form of
fine black powder or soot. If we raise the chimney up from the card,
as shown in fig. 211, so as to leave enough space between them at the
bottom of the chimney to permit air to enter so as to supply the flame
with oxygen, the smoke will instantly cease, as the particles of carbon
are then consumed. The same principle is illustrated in an ordinary
kerosene lamp. It is well known that without a chimney the flames of
nearly all such lamps smoke intolerably, whereas with a glass chimney
and the peculiarly formed deflector which surrounds the wick the light
burns without smoke unless the wick is turned up high. The effect of
the chimney is to produce a draft, which is thrown against the flame by
the deflector, and thus a sufficient supply of oxygen is furnished to
consume all the particles of carbon, whereas without the draft produced
by the chimney the supply of oxygen is insufficient to ignite all the
carbon, which then escapes in the form of smoke or soot.

[Illustration:

  _Fig. 212._

  _Fig. 213._]

It must not, however, be hastily assumed that if the flame does not
give out a bright light, therefore the combustion is not complete.
As has already been stated, the light of the gas flame is due to the
presence of burning particles of solid carbon, which is set free by
the combustion of the hydrogen with which it is combined. After it is
separated from the hydrogen it immediately assumes a solid form. If
the coal gas is mixed with a sufficient quantity of air before it
is burned, the oxygen in the latter will be in such intimate contact
with the former that the difference of affinity of oxygen for the
carbon and hydrogen does not come into play, and as there is enough
oxygen for all, the carbon is burnt before it is set free, and as
there are then no solid particles in the flame, there is no light.
This is illustrated by a “Bunsen burner,” fig. 212, which is much used
in chemical laboratories. It consists of a small tube or burner, _a_,
which is placed inside of another larger tube _b_. The latter has
holes, _c_, _c_, a little below the top of the small tube. The current
of gas escaping from the small tube produces what is called an _induced
current_ of air in the large tube. This air enters through the holes
_c_, _c_, and is mixed with the gas in the tube _b_, and the mixture
is burned at _d_. The flame from such a burner gives hardly any light,
but the heat is intense, as is shown if a metal wire is held in it for
a few seconds, as it will very soon glow with heat.

QUESTION 380. _What important difference is there in the structure of
the flame of a Bunsen burner and that of an ordinary gas-burner or
candle?_

_Answer._ The gas which escapes from the mouth _d_ of the pipe _b_,
fig. 212, is mixed with air, and therefore contains within itself the
elements which only need to combine to produce combustion; whereas with
an ordinary gas-burner or candle the air comes in contact with the
flame only from the outside, or on its surface. This is shown better
perhaps in the flame of an ordinary candle. The heat of such a flame
distils a gas from the melted tallow, which is similar in nature to
that which escapes from coal at a high temperature. Now by observing
the candle very closely it will be seen that at the bottom close to the
wick there is very little combustion, as the gas there first escapes
from the wick and is not heated to a sufficiently high temperature
to burn freely. A little above the lowermost part the flame is of a
pale bluish color, which is due to the combustion of the hydrogen.
Above that, where the carbon is set free, its particles glow with heat
imparted by the burning hydrogen and are then consumed by uniting with
the oxygen of the air. The combustion occurs only at the surface of the
flame, the inside being a mass of combustible gas which cannot burn
until it in turn comes in contact with the oxygen of the air. This can
be proved by inserting one end of a small tube, fig. 213 (a pipe stem
will do), which is open at both ends, into the flame. The combustible
gas will then escape at the other end and can easily be lighted with a
match.

It will be found that the flame from the Bunsen burner is much more
intense than that of an ordinary candle or gas-burner. The reason of
this is that combustion, as already stated, takes place through the
whole mass of its flame, whereas an ordinary flame burns only at its
surface. Common gas-jets are therefore arranged so that the flames
will be flat, thus exposing as much surface to the air as possible,
and, as explained in answer to Question 329, in describing the lamps
for head-lights, their burners are usually made with a circular
wick, through the centre of which a current of air circulates. This
arrangement exposes a larger surface of the flame to the air, and also
with the aid of a chimney furnishes an abundant supply for combustion.
In stationary boilers with long flues of a large sectional area the
flame will often extend for thirty feet, showing that while combustion
is going on only at the surface of the flame, it takes a long time to
complete the process. The same thing is shown if a gas-burner is made
with a single round hole. The flame will then be very long and liable
to smoke at the top.

QUESTION 381. _From the preceding considerations what may we infer to
be necessary in order to consume coal gas perfectly?_

_Answer._ In the first place, that there must exist a certain degree
of what chemists call “molecular activity,” which is produced by heat,
or what we have called the _igniting temperature_. The necessity of
this is sufficiently obvious with ordinary gas-burners, as they must
always be _lighted_ before they will burn. Now imagine that it was
required to burn gas which was issuing from a hundred jets, of every
variety of size, in a violent wind storm, or gusts of wind. Obviously
it would be necessary to keep a lighted torch all the time to relight
those which would be blown out. The gas in a locomotive fire-box is in
reality burnt in a storm of wind more violent than any natural one. It
is therefore necessary to be constantly ready to relight the streams
of gas which the faintest breath would extinguish, or those of larger
volume which have absorbed a great deal of heat and thus reduced the
temperature at the time and place of their birth, when they assumed the
gaseous form, as was explained in answer to Question 376. To relight
them with certainty it is necessary to keep a constant temperature
in the fire-box high enough to ignite the gas which escapes or is
distilled from the coal.

_Second._ That the chemical change in combustion consists simply in the
union of the elements burned with the oxygen of the air; and therefore,
to burn the gas perfectly, without smoke or waste, _enough_ air must be
furnished to supply all the oxygen which will combine with the fuel.

_Third._ That the air must be mixed with the gas, otherwise combustion
will occur only at the surface of the flame, and will therefore be so
slow that much of the gas will escape unconsumed.

It must be clearly kept in mind that no one or two of these
requirements alone, without the third, will burn coal perfectly.
What is needed is all three in combination. A very common error is
to suppose that passing smoke over a hot fire, or in other words,
maintaining an igniting temperature, will alone effect perfect
combustion; or that if a sufficient supply of air is admitted, without
an igniting temperature in the fire-box, the fuel will be burnt
completely. Neither of them will accomplish the object alone, and the
gas and air must at the same time be thoroughly mixed with the burning
gas in the fire-box.

QUESTION 382. _What substances are produced by the combustion of coal
gas?_

_Answer._ The hydrogen of coal gas unites during combustion with oxygen
in the proportion, as indicated by their chemical equivalents, of 1
part by weight of hydrogen with 8 parts of oxygen, the product of which
is water. Of course at the high temperature at which the gases combine
or burn the water is produced in the form of steam. That water or steam
is one of the products of combustion is shown every cold evening, when
the insides of shop show-windows are covered with moisture, which is
due to the steam that is given off by the burning gas-lights or lamps
inside, and is then condensed against the cold glass.

Carbon combines with oxygen in two proportions: first, 6 parts of
the former will unite with 8 of the latter, forming what is called
_carbonic oxide_; or 6 parts of carbon will combine with 16 parts of
oxygen, forming _carbonic acid gas_ or _carbonic dioxide_, as it is
called in some of the new books on chemistry. It is probable that the
former compound, that is carbonic oxide, is never or very rarely formed
in the flame of coal gas; but, as will be seen hereafter, is a very
common and wasteful product of the combustion of the solid portion of
the coal which is left after the gas is expelled from it. When there
is not enough oxygen for the perfect combustion of the carbon in the
flame, it smokes, and the carbon escapes in the form of soot. This, as
will be shown, may in a locomotive fire-box help to form carbonic oxide
after it leaves the flame.

QUESTION 383. _What remains in the coal after all the gas is expelled
by heat?_

_Answer._ What remains is ordinarily called coke, which, with the
exception of some incombustible substances, such as sand, ashes and
cinders, which the coal contains, is nearly pure carbon.

QUESTION 384. _What is the chemical process of the combustion of coke?_

_Answer._ The solid carbon of the coke when raised to an igniting
temperature; or, in other words, on being lighted, unites with the
oxygen in one of the two proportions already given; that is, if the
supply of oxygen is sufficient, 6 parts of the carbon of the coke
unite with 16 parts of oxygen, forming carbonic acid gas, or carbonic
dioxide. If, however, the layer of fuel on the grates is thick, or the
supply of air is comparatively small, there will not be enough oxygen
to supply 16 parts of the latter to each 6 parts of the carbon, so that
when that occurs, instead of combining in that proportion, and thus
forming carbonic dioxide, 8 parts of oxygen will unite with 6 parts
of carbon and form carbonic oxide. Now it should be carefully kept in
mind that the heat of combustion is due to the union, or, as it is
sometimes expressed, it is the clashing together of the molecules of
the two elements which unite. If, therefore, only half the quantity of
oxygen unites with 6 parts of carbon, evidently there will be less heat
evolved than there would be if twice that amount of oxygen combined
with the carbon. From carefully made experiments it was found that the
total heat of the combustion of one pound of carbon when converted into
_carbonic oxide_ was 4,400 units, whereas when it was converted into
_carbonic dioxide_ 14,500 units were given out. It will thus be seen
that it is extremely wasteful to burn coal without a sufficient supply
of air to produce carbonic dioxide. The danger of waste from this
cause is also increased by the fact that carbonic oxide is colorless
and odorless, and therefore its production is not apparent, especially
as most persons have the impression that when there is no smoke from
a fire combustion is then complete. It burns with a blue or yellowish
flame when air is admitted into the fire-box, and its presence can
often be detected by these phenomena when the furnace door is opened.

QUESTION 385. _How can the requisite quantity of air be supplied to the
fire in a locomotive fire-box?_

_Answer_. It is done in two ways: one is to keep but little coal on the
grates, or in the phraseology of firemen, to “carry a light fire.” The
other method is to admit fresh air above the fire. If the latter plan
is adopted when the supply of air through the grates is insufficient
for perfect combustion, the carbonic oxide will unite with the oxygen
of the air above the fire, and thus a second combustion will take
place, the product of which will be carbonic dioxide. It must be kept
in mind, however, that not only must there be enough air supplied to
the fire to consume the coke, but the gases which are distilled from
the coal must also be supplied with oxygen in order to effect their
perfect combustion. Even if enough air is admitted to consume the coke
perfectly, if the carbonic dioxide thus formed is mixed with large
quantities of smoke above the fire, the solid carbon or soot of the
smoke may then combine with the dioxide and thus form carbonic oxide,
if there is not enough fresh air present to furnish the requisite
oxygen for the carbon in the smoke. A very common error is to suppose
that smoke can be burned by passing it over or through a very hot fire.
The smoke may thus be made invisible, it is true, but it does not
therefore follow that it is perfectly consumed.

QUESTION 386. _Is it possible to admit too much air into the fire-box
of a locomotive?_

_Answer_. Yes; probably all the air that is admitted which is not
necessary for combustion, or, in other words, the oxygen of which
does not combine with the fuel, instead of increasing diminishes the
amount of water converted into steam. It does this in two ways; first,
by reducing the temperature of the gases in contact with the heating
surfaces, and second, by increasing the volume or quantity of the gases
which must pass through the tubes. Heat is transmitted through the
heating surface of a boiler in proportion to the _difference_ of the
temperature of the products of combustion on one side and the water on
the other.[94] Thus, if the temperature of the water on one side is 250
degrees, and the hot gases on the other is 500, there will be only half
as much heat transmitted to the water in a given time as there would be
if the gases had a temperature of 750 degrees. If the volume of gases
is doubled by the admission of too much air, then obviously in order
to pass through the tubes they must move at double the velocity, so
that not only is their temperature diminished, but the time they are
in contact with the heating surface is diminished in like proportion.
This is shown by the effect of opening the furnace door, or of allowing
the fire to burn away so that portions of the grate are left uncovered.
The volume of cold air which will in either of these cases enter the
fire-box will be so great that the pressure of the steam in the boiler
will begin to fall at once.

  [94] This law is perhaps not absolutely correct, but is near enough
  for our present illustration.

QUESTION 387. _What determines the amount of air which must be admitted
to the fire-box of a locomotive to effect perfect combustion?_

_Answer_. This depends chiefly upon the _rate of combustion_, that is,
the number of pounds of coal consumed per hour on each square foot of
grate surface. Of course if 100 pounds is burnt it will require twice
the supply of air that would be needed if only 50 pounds were burnt.

QUESTION 388. _How should the air be admitted so as to burn the coal
perfectly?_

_Answer_. In burning bituminous coal it has been shown that there are
two distinct bodies to be dealt with, the one coke, a _solid_, the
other coal gas, which is of course a _gaseous body_. The combustion
of each of these is necessarily a distinct process. If the requisite
quantity of air is supplied to the burning coke, or solid portion
of the coal, it will, as has been shown, be converted into carbonic
dioxide, and thus be perfectly consumed. If the supply of air is
insufficient, the product of the combustion will be carbonic oxide,
which is very wasteful. If, for example, there is a thick layer of
coke on the grate, the air will enter and unite with the lower layer
of coal and form carbonic dioxide, but as it rises there will not be
enough air to supply oxygen to the carbon, and another equivalent of
the latter will therefore combine with the carbonic dioxide and form
carbonic oxide. It is evident, though, that the thinner the fire, the
easier it is for air to pass through it, and consequently the greater
will be the quantity which will enter the fire-box. Nothing would seem
easier then than to regulate the thickness of the fire on the grates
so that just the needed amount of air would pass through it. If coke
alone was to be burned, undoubtedly very perfect combustion would be
(and has been) effected in this way, but if a charge of fresh coal, say
100 pounds, is thrown on the fire, the coal gas is very soon generated
and escapes into the fire-box. This gas needs an additional amount of
air for its combustion. It would seem that this could be supplied by
reducing the thickness of the fire still further, so that more air
would pass through it than was needed for the combustion of the coke
alone. If this was done then too much air would pass through the coke
after the gases had all escaped from the fresh coal and were burned.
Besides, the passage of the air would be the most restricted after the
fresh charge had been put on the fire, just at the time when the most
is needed. This difficulty might be overcome if a constant supply of
fresh coal just equal to that consumed were kept on the fire all the
time, and the thickness of fuel on the grates was then regulated so
as to admit just air enough for the combustion of the coke and also
that of the gases, the production of which would then be uniform. An
approximation to this method of feeding the fire is, in fact, what is
aimed at on most locomotives, and probably the best practical results
are produced by that method.

Two difficulties are, however, encountered in this method. In the first
place it is impossible to feed a fire continuously with a shovel. There
will be intervals between the charges which are thrown in, so that the
supply is not uniform, even if the charges do not consist of more than
a portion of a shovel-full at a time; and if the fire was fed in this
way as uniformly as possible it would then be necessary to open the
furnace door every time fresh coal was put on the fire, and so much
cold air would thus be admitted that more would be lost by lowering
the temperature of the boiler than would be gained by the improved
combustion.

Another difficulty also is encountered in this method of burning coal
in locomotives. In order to admit enough air through the fire it is
necessary to keep the latter so thin on the grates that the violent
draft produced by the blast lifts the coal from the grate-bars and
carries the lighter particles through the flues unconsumed. It is thus
extremely difficult to keep the grate uniformly covered with coal,
and if it is not, the air will enter in irregular and rapid streams
or masses through the uncovered parts, and at the very time when it
should be _there_ most restricted. Such a state of things at once bids
defiance to all regulation or control, so that it is found almost
uniformly that firemen of locomotives keep enough coal on the grates to
avoid the danger of “losing their fire,” as they express it; that is,
having all the burning coal drawn through the tubes by the blast. _Now,
on the control of the supply of air depends all that human skill can
do in effecting perfect combustion and economy_; and unless the supply
of fuel and the quantity on the bars can be regulated, it will be
impossible to control the admission of the air.[95]

  [95] The Combustion of Coal, by C. Wye Williams.

Another method of feeding locomotive boilers is to pile up the coal in
the back part in a thick layer and slope it downward towards the front,
so that there is a comparatively thin fire in front. The mass piled
up at the door becomes converted into coke, and the production of gas
from the coal is more gradual and uniform than it is when only a small
quantity is thrown in at a time, and therefore a more uniform supply of
air is needed for its combustion. But it is apparent that very little
air can pass through the thick heap of coal at the back part of the
fire-box, and that therefore all, or nearly all the air which enters
it must come in through a comparatively small portion of the grate. It
will of course be difficult to admit the requisite quantity, for the
reasons already stated.

It is consequently apparent that it is practically impossible to admit
enough air through the grates to effect a constantly perfect combustion
of bituminous coal. It is, therefore, necessary to admit a portion of
the air above the fire. In doing this, however, in order to effect
perfect combustion the air thus admitted must be thoroughly mixed with
the gases, and in order to be able to enter into chemical combination,
or in other words, to burn, the gases must combine with the air at an
igniting temperature. If too much air is admitted, it will reduce the
temperature in the fire-box so much that the gases will not ignite;
or, if it is admitted in strong currents, the air and the gases will
flow side by side like the currents of two streams of water, the one
muddy and the other clear, which, as is well known, mingle very slowly.
Besides, if a hot stream of gas encounters a strong stream of cold air
and comes in contact with it only at its surface, the latter will be
cooled down below the igniting temperature; whereas if the two had been
intimately mixed in the right proportion, the whole mixture would have
been hot enough to burn. It is therefore of the utmost importance that
the air which is admitted above the fire should enter the fire-box in
many small jets. None of the openings for its admission should exceed
¹⁄₂ inch in diameter. With the violent draft in a locomotive fire-box
there is an extremely brief period of time for chemical combination
to take place after the gases are expelled from the coal and before
they are hurried into the tubes. As the chemical action between the
gases and the oxygen can only take place when the two are in intimate
contact, too much pains cannot be taken to distribute the currents of
admitted air and thus mix them with the combustible gases. In many
cases means are adopted to delay the air and the gases in the fire-box
so as to give them time for chemical combination or combustion before
entering the tubes.

QUESTION 389. _Does any combustion take place after the gases enter the
tubes?_

_Answer._ Very little; as the flames are extinguished soon after they
enter.

QUESTION 390. _Why are the flames extinguished in the tubes?_

_Answer._ They are then in contact with large quantities of
incombustible gas and beyond the reach of a supply of air; besides, the
temperature of the tubes which are surrounded with water is so low that
the flame is soon cooled down below an igniting temperature.

QUESTION 391. _What temperature is necessary to ignite coal gas or
produce flame?_

_Answer._ A temperature considerably hotter than red-hot iron is
needed, as can easily be shown by the fact that a gas-light can not be
ignited with a red-hot poker.

QUESTION 392. _Are there any parts of the fire-box where the
temperature is probably below the igniting point?_

_Answer._ Yes; along the sides and ends near the plates, which are
covered with water on the opposite side. At these points the coal is
usually “dead” or incandescent, as it remains at too low a temperature
to burn. For this reason, in some cases a space of from 8 to 12 inches
on each side and still more at the ends of the grates, is made of solid
plates, without any openings, and therefore called “_dead-grates_,”
so that no cold air can enter at those points. These plates are made
sloping downwards from the sides towards the centre of the fire-box,
so that the coal which falls on them and is thus coked, can easily be
raked towards the middle of the fire. This arrangement of dead plates
often improves the combustion and results in greater economy of fuel.
The reduction of the area of the openings between the grate-bars can
usually be compensated by making the bars narrower or the spaces
between them wider.

QUESTION 393. _What should be the condition of the coal when it is put
on the fire?_

_Answer._ It is true of the coal as well as of the gases that the
chemical action between it and the oxygen can only take place when
the two are in intimate contact, and therefore the rapidity and
completeness of combustion and intensity of heat will be increased by
increasing the number of points of contact, or by reducing the size of
the fuel. The coal should therefore be broken up, but not so small as
to fall between the grate-bars or be carried out of the fire-box by the
blast.

QUESTION 394. _What amount of air must be admitted to the fire to
effect perfect combustion?_

_Answer._ It was stated that average bituminous coal contains about 80
per cent. carbon, 5 per cent. of hydrogen and 15 per cent. of other
substances. As a large proportion of the latter are incombustible, we
will confine ourselves for the present to the consideration of the
combustion of the hydrogen and carbon alone.

The hydrogen, as has been explained, unites with oxygen in the
proportion by weight of 1 part of the former to 8 parts of the latter,
and the product of this union is water, or steam. As 36 parts of air
contain only 8 of oxygen, IN ORDER TO BURN THE HYDROGEN IT MUST BE
SUPPLIED WITH 36 TIMES ITS WEIGHT OF AIR.

In order to burn the carbon perfectly it must, as has been explained,
be converted into carbonic dioxide, which consists of 6 parts of carbon
and 16 of oxygen; and as air consists of 28 parts of nitrogen to every
8 of oxygen, we must furnish 72 parts of air to every 6 of carbon, or,
in other words, CARBON NEEDS 12 TIMES ITS WEIGHT OF AIR FOR ITS PERFECT
COMBUSTION.

Every pound of average bituminous coal therefore requires 1.8 lbs. of
air to burn its hydrogen, and 9.6 lbs. for the carbon, or 11.4 for
both. As a portion of the other substances of which coal is composed,
besides the oxygen and hydrogen, which others have been classed as
impurities, are combustible, there will be no material error if we
estimate the amount of air required for the combustion of bituminous
coal at 12 POUNDS PER POUND OF FUEL. As each cubic foot of air weighs
0.08072 lb., 12 pounds will be equal to

     12
  ------- = 148.6 cubic feet of air,
  0.08072

or for the sake of even figures and a quantity which can easily be
remembered, we will say 150 CUBIC FEET OF AIR ARE NEEDED FOR THE
COMBUSTION OF EACH POUND OF COAL. This is the theoretical quantity of
air which is needed for combustion. Now, unfortunately, the process of
combustion in the fire-boxes of locomotives is one in which any very
exact combination of the substances which unite is not possible with
the appliances which are now employed. If, therefore, we admitted the
exact amount of air given above, while some portions of the fire where
combustion was not very active might have more air than is needed,
other portions would have too little; and if the air is not very
thoroughly mixed, the flame and burning coal may be surrounded with the
products of combustion, which would exclude the air and thus reduce
its effect upon the fire. For this reason, besides the air required
to furnish the oxygen necessary for the complete combustion of the
fuel, it is also necessary to furnish an additional quantity of air
for the _dilution_ of the gaseous products of combustion, which would
otherwise prevent the free access of air to the fuel. The more minute
the division and the greater the velocity with which the air rushes
among the fuel, the smaller is the additional quantity of air required
for dilution. In locomotive boilers, although this quantity has not
been exactly ascertained, there is reason to believe that it may on
an average be estimated at about _one-half_ of the air required for
combustion.[96] We would therefore have as the quantity of air needed
for combustion

        150
  150 + --- = 225 cubic feet.
         2

This estimate is roughly made, but it is the nearest approximation at
present attainable. It is probable that the supply of air required
for dilution varies considerably in different arrangements of the
fire-box and for different kinds of fuel, and it is possible that by
admitting the air for combustion in small enough jets, and deflecting
the currents of smoke and gases so as to cause them to mingle with the
air, the quantity required for dilution might be reduced below that
indicated by the above calculation. Undoubtedly all the air which is
admitted into the fire-box which does not combine with the chemical
elements of the fuel lessens the amount of steam generated in the
boiler, both with reference to time, that is to say per minute, and
to fuel, that is per pound of coal consumed. But with the present
locomotive boiler it is simply a choice of two evils. If no more air is
admitted than theory indicates to be needed for combustion, then, owing
to the imperfect means which are usually employed to cause the air and
fuel to combine, a portion of the latter will escape unconsumed; and if
_more_ air is admitted, the temperature of the products of combustion
is lowered and their volume increased, the evils of which have already
been pointed out. It therefore becomes a matter in which we are obliged
to consult experience and determine by experiment what amount of air
it is necessary to admit to the fuel to produce the most economical
results.

QUESTION 395. _What proportion of the air should be admitted through
the grate, and how much above the fire?_

_Answer._ This, too, is a question which can probably be answered
best by consulting experience. The relative quantity of air required
above and below the fire depends very much on the nature of the fuel.
Coal which “runs together” or cakes very much or has a great deal of
clinker in it, doubtless, will need more air above the fire than other
coal which is said to be “dryer,” for the reason that it will be found
impossible to admit so much air through the caking coal in the grate as
through the other kind. An idea of the relative quantity which should
be admitted above and below the fire may be found if we know how much
air is needed to burn the solid carbon or coke which is left after the
gas is expelled from it, and how much for the gas itself. The gas which
is expelled from a pound of coal consists of about 0.05 lb. of hydrogen
and 0.15 lb. of carbon. Now, it has been shown that hydrogen requires
36 times its weight of air to burn it perfectly, so that 0.05 lb. would
need 0.05 × 36 = 1.8 lbs.; and carbon requires 12 times its weight of
air, so that for 0.15 lb. of carbon 0.15 × 12 = 1.8 lbs. is needed, so
that for both 3.6 lbs. of air is required for perfect combustion. As
has been shown, 12 lbs. is needed to consume the whole of the fuel, so
that 30 per cent. of the whole supply is required for the combustion
of the gas alone. If this is diluted in the same proportion as that
required for the combustion of the carbon, and it probably should be
even more so, we would have 30 per cent. of 225 = 67.5 cubic feet of
air required for the combustion of the gas. It is certain, however,
that the solid coke on the grates is not perfectly consumed, or, in
other words, converted into carbonic dioxide, especially when the layer
of it on the grates is very thick. When this is the case the air coming
in contact with the lower layer of coke forms carbonic dioxide, but as
it rises through the burning coke another equivalent of carbon unites
with the carbonic dioxide, and thus forms carbonic oxide. If, now,
enough air is admitted above the fire, this carbonic oxide will combine
with it, and, as has been explained before, a second combustion will
take place if there is time and opportunity for combination before the
gases enter the flues. It is therefore probable that more than 30 per
cent. of the whole supply of air should be admitted above the fire. It
is at any rate best to provide the means for admitting more, and also
appliances for regulating the supply, so that it can be governed as
experience may indicate to be best.

QUESTION 396. _Is it not possible by enlarging the grate to admit
enough air to the fire to produce perfect combustion?_

_Answer._ Yes; when no air is admitted above the fire, large grates are
found to produce the best combustion. But while it is true that the
same amount of heat will be produced by the union of each equivalent
of oxygen and fuel, yet if we can force _more_ air and fuel to unite
in the _same place_, a higher temperature is produced in that place,
just as a fire in a blacksmith’s forge is hotter because of the forced
blast than that in an ordinary stove, or a smelting furnace than a
parlor grate. If, then, we can concentrate the draft in the fire of a
locomotive, we secure a greater _intensity_ of combustion; and when the
air is urged against the solid carbon with considerable force, it comes
in contact with every point of its surface, and therefore less dilution
of the air is needed, and consequently the products of combustion have
a higher temperature; and, as has been explained, a larger proportion
of the heat is then transferred to the water than if the temperature is
lower and the volume greater.

Intensity of combustion also has the effect of maintaining an igniting
temperature; whereas, if the same amount of fuel is burned slowly, its
heat may not be high enough to ignite the gases as they are produced.

It is desirable, however, to have all the space that is possible in the
fire-box, so as to give room for the mixing of the gases; but with a
large fire-box and large grate a decided improvement and economy will
often result by diminishing the effective area of the grate by covering
a part of it with dead plates, but at the same time making provision
for the admission of air above the fire.

QUESTION 397. _What is meant by the “Total Heat of Combustion?”_

_Answer._ It is the number of units of heat given out by the combustion
of a given quantity (usually a pound) of fuel.

QUESTION 398. _How is this determined?_

_Answer._ The heat given out by the combustion of one pound of the
chemical elements of which coal is composed has been determined by
experiment, and from such data, knowing the substances of which fuel is
composed, we can determine the amount of heat which would be developed
if they were each perfectly consumed. Thus the total heat of combustion
of one pound of hydrogen is 62,032 units, and of the same quantity of
carbon 14,500 units.[97] Therefore, if a pound of coal contains 5 per
cent. of hydrogen, the heat given out by the combustion of that element
will be 62,032 × 0.05 = 3,101.60 units, and if it has 80 per cent. of
carbon, the combustion of the latter would develop 14,500 × 0.80 =
11,600 units, so that the total heat of the combustion of these two
elements would be 3,101.6 + 11,600 = 14,701.6 units. It was shown in
answer to Question 40 that it required 1,213.4 units of heat to convert
water at zero to steam of 100 pounds pressure. As steam is usually
generated from water at a temperature of about 60 degrees, the total
heat required to convert it into steam of 100 pounds pressure would
be 1,213.4 - 60 = 1,153.4 units. A pound of average bituminous coal,
therefore, contains heat enough to convert 12¹⁄₄ lbs. of water into
steam of 100 lbs. absolute pressure. Ordinarily only about half that
amount of water is evaporated in locomotive boilers per pound of fuel.

  [97] The experiments which have been made to determine these amounts
  do not agree exactly, but those given are thought to be the most
  trustworthy.

QUESTION 399. _What are the chief causes of this waste of heat?_

_Answer._ It is due, _first_, to the waste of unburnt fuel in the
solid state. This occurs when fuel which is very fine falls through the
grates, or is carried through the tubes and out of the stack in the
form of cinders.[98]

  [98] It should be remarked here that some and perhaps most of the
  cinders which are carried out of the stack are not combustible but
  are composed of the same materials that form clinkers on the grate.

_Second_, to the waste of unburnt fuel in the gaseous or smoky state.
The method of preventing this waste by a sufficient supply and proper
distribution of air has been explained in the answer to preceding
questions.

_Third_, to the waste or loss of heat in the hot gases which escape up
the chimney or smoke stack. The temperature of the fire in a locomotive
fire-box in a state of active combustion is probably from 3,000 to
4,000 degrees. This heat is in part radiated and conducted to the
heating surface of the fire-box, and it is found that more water is
evaporated by this portion of the heating surface in proportion to
its area than by any other in the boiler. The gases when they enter
the tubes transmit a portion of their heat to the surfaces with which
they are first in contact. The amount of heat thus transmitted, as
has been stated, is in proportion to the _difference_ in temperature
of the gases inside the tubes and that of the water outside. After
passing over the part of the tube with which the gases are first in
contact, they then arrive at another portion of the tube surface with
a diminished temperature, and the rate of conduction is therefore
diminished; so that each successive equal portion of the heating
surface transmits a less and less quantity of heat, until the hot air
at last leaves the heating surface and escapes up the chimney with a
certain remaining excess of temperature above that of the water in
the boiler, the heat corresponding to which excess is wasted.[99] It
is, therefore, desirable to extract as much heat as possible from the
gases before they escape from the tubes. Now it will be impossible to
heat the water outside of the tubes hotter than the gases inside. When
the temperature of the water is equal to that of the gases, no more
heat will be transmitted from one to the other. If the temperature of
the water is 350 degrees, that of the gases in the tubes will never
be any lower, but will escape into the smoke-box with not less than
that amount of heat. If, however, the cold water is introduced at the
front end of the tubes, so that the surface with which the gases are
last in contact has a temperature considerably lower than 350, then an
additional amount of heat will be transmitted before they escape. It
is, therefore, important that the cold feed-water should be admitted
near the front end of the boiler, so that the products of combustion
will be in contact with the coldest part of the heating surface last,
and thus give out as much of their heat as possible before they escape.
As a matter of fact, the gases escape at a much higher temperature.
Experiments made by the writer showed that the temperature in the
smoke-box of a locomotive when first starting was 270 degrees, and when
working at its maximum capacity on a steep grade and with a heavy train
it was as high as 675 degrees. The average temperature while running
was, in three trials on different parts of the road, as follows:

  Average steam pressure,  98.8 lbs.; average temperature, 499.8 lbs.
  Average steam pressure, 106   lbs.; average temperature, 535.1 lbs.
  Average steam pressure, 112.2 lbs.; average temperature, 554   lbs.

  [99] Rankine.

In making these experiments a record was made of the indications of
a pyrometer and of the steam gauge once every minute while the engine
was running. The distance run was 19 miles for the first experiment, 13
for the second and 6 for the third, with 30 loaded freight cars in the
train. The last experiment was made while the engine was working on a
heavy grade and very nearly up to its maximum capacity.

It will thus be seen that a great deal of heat is wasted by escaping up
the chimney.

_Fourth_, by external radiation from the boiler. This occurs chiefly
from the fact that it is not sufficiently well protected or covered
with non-conducting material. The practice, or rather the neglect, of
not covering the outside of the fire-box with lagging doubtless causes
a very considerable loss of heat by radiation and convection from the
hot boiler plates.

QUESTION 400. _What is the ordinary form of fire-box employed for
burning bituminous coal?_

_Answer._ It is that represented in plate II and figs. 41 and 44, and
is simply a rectangular box, and for that reason it is called a _plain_
fire-box. Sometimes provision is made for admitting air into such
fire-boxes through hollow or rather tubular stay-bolts, which are put
into the sides and front. In most cases, too, the fire-box door has
perforations for admitting air.

[Illustration: Fig. 214. Scale ³⁄₈ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 401. _What other appliances are used for burning bituminous
coal?_

_Answer._ The most common appliance which is added to the plain
fire-box is what is called a _fire-brick arch_. This is shown in
fig. 214. _B C_ is the arch which, as its name implies, is formed
of fire-brick and extends backward and upward from a point in the
tube-sheet below the tubes. In order to be self-supporting it is
built in the form of an arch, the two sides of the fire-box acting as
abutments for its support. The engraving represents with sufficient
clearness the direction of the flames and smoke. These must take a more
circuitous “_run_,” as it is called, after leaving the fire, in order
to reach the tubes. Time is thus given for the gases to combine and
combustion to take place. The fire-brick becomes heated, and thus to
some extent prevents the gases from being cooled down below an igniting
temperature by contact with the cold surface of the fire-box before
combustion is complete. The fire-brick, however, soon burns out, and
must be replaced, but owing to its cheapness and the ease with which
it can be removed, this does not make a serious objection to its use.
Air is nearly always admitted above the fire when the brick arch is
used, either by tubular stay-bolts, _a_, _a_, _a_, or perforations in
the door, or both.

[Illustration: Fig. 215. Scale ³⁄₈ in. = 1 foot.]

In order to avoid the inconvenience and expense of replacing the
fire-brick arch, what is known as the “Jauriet water-table” has been
extensively used on some roads. This is the invention of Mr. C. F.
Jauriet and is represented in fig. 215, and consists of a flat “table,”
_B C_, formed of two boiler plates placed about 4¹⁄₂ in. apart, with
the space between filled with water. The two plates are stayed with
ordinary stay-bolts in the same way as the sides of the fire-box. The
form of the water-table is similar to that of the fire-brick, excepting
that it is not arched, this form not being necessary, as the plates
are riveted to the sides of the fire-box. Air is admitted above the
fire both by hollow stay-bolts and holes in the door, as shown at _A_.
Tubes, _f_, are put into the front and lower portion of the water-table
to allow the ashes and cinders, which would otherwise be deposited
above, to fall down on the grates.

[Illustration: Fig. 216.]

When air is admitted at the furnace door of an ordinary fire-box, it
is very apt to rush directly into the tubes without mingling with the
gases. It was found by some of the firemen on English railroads that by
placing a shovel over the top of the furnace door, the current of air
which entered could thus be deflected downward, and in this way smoke
could be almost entirely prevented. This led to the adoption of a hood
or deflector, _A_, fig. 216, which is made of sheet iron and is placed
over the fire-box door and is arranged with a lever, _B_, so that it
can be raised in order to be out of the way when coal is thrown on the
fire. It is suspended from a hook, _C_, from which it can easily be
detached and taken out for repairs. This is frequently necessary, as
the intense heat of the fire-box burns away the sheet iron of which it
is made very rapidly. It can be made of old boiler plate, so that the
expense of renewal is very slight. When this plan is used, a double
sliding door, shown in fig. 217, is commonly used with it. These doors
are opened by the levers _f d_; and _e g_, which are all connected
together. With these sliding doors the opening for the admission of air
can easily be regulated, and the opening through which the lever, _B_,
is attached to the deflector, _A_, can be arranged more conveniently
than with a swinging door. This plan has been employed by the Rogers
Locomotive Works.

[Illustration: Fig. 217.

Scale ³⁄₈ in. = 1 foot.]

Another plan of fire-box, which was designed and patented by Mr.
William Buchanan, Master Mechanic of the Hudson River Railroad, and
used extensively on that line, is shown in fig. 218. This consists
of a water-table, but it extends completely across the fire-box from
the tube sheet to the back-plate, thus dividing the fire-box into two
compartments, _M_ and _N_. In order to afford communication from the
lower one to the upper one a round hole, _D_, about 24 in. in diameter,
is put in the water-table in the position shown. It will thus be seen
that all the currents of gas, smoke and air must unite in passing
through this opening, and are thus brought into close contact with
each other. After they enter the upper chamber and before they enter
the tubes, there is room and time for combustion. The position of the
lower side of the table, it will be seen, is similar to that of the
deflector shown in fig. 216, so that it acts in somewhat the same way,
by directing the currents of air, which enter through the furnace door,
downward on the fire.

[Illustration: Fig. 218. Scale ³⁄₈ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 402. _How do these different plans operate?_

_Answer._ They will all burn coal more perfectly, and therefore more
economically, if they are carefully and skillfully managed, than is
possible in ordinary plain fire-boxes; but it is probable that more
economy in the consumption of coal would result from the improvement of
the practice and knowledge of firemen than can be expected from the use
of any of the appliances described, if they are used without care, or
knowledge of the principles of combustion.

QUESTION 403. _In what respect does anthracite coal differ from
bituminous?_

_Answer._ It differs chiefly in the fact that it contains a much larger
proportion of carbon and less of hydrogen, and in the fact that it
consequently gives off very little or no coal gas. Its combustion is
therefore more simple than that of bituminous coal, as there is very
little else than solid carbon to burn.

QUESTION 404. _In what kind of a fire-box is anthracite usually burned?_

_Answer._ It is usually burned in a very long grate, and as the heat is
very intense, the grate-bars are usually made of iron tubes, through
which a current of water circulates, so as to prevent them from
melting.

QUESTION 405. _Is it important to admit air above an anthracite fire to
facilitate combustion?_

_Answer._ As there are no gases to be burned, it is not so important
as it is with bituminous coal, but if the layer of anthracite on the
grates is very thick, it will be impossible to get enough air through
the coal to convert all the carbon into carbonic dioxide, and the
carbon and oxygen will therefore unite so as to form carbonic oxide.
If air is admitted above the fire, as has already been explained,
another equivalent of oxygen will unite with the carbonic oxide, and
a second combustion will then take place above the fire, and the
carbonic oxide will thus be converted into carbonic dioxide. If, under
these circumstances, no air was admitted above the fire, the second
combustion would not occur, and all the heat produced thereby would be
lost.

QUESTION 406. _How can we determine the relative value of different
kinds of fuel for use in locomotives?_

_Answer._ This can only be determined satisfactorily by actual
experiment. The chemical composition, excepting so far as it indicates
the presence of deleterious substances, such as sulphur, ashes,
clinkers, etc., affords but little assistance in determining the value
of fuel. Nearly the same quantities of elements in different fuels may
arrange themselves, before and during combustion, so as to produce very
different series of compounds. It is true that the composition of coal
gives us some indication of its heat-producing _capacity_, but the
extent to which that capacity can be converted into actual steam in
locomotive boilers, depends to a very great extent upon the conditions
under which the fuel is burned. It should also be remembered that the
rapidity with which steam can be generated is a very important matter
in locomotive practice. Whether a heavy freight train can be taken up a
given grade, or a fast express make time, often depends upon the amount
of steam which can be generated by the fuel in each second of time that
the boiler is worked to its maximum capacity. Therefore any appliance
for improving combustion, which reduces the quantity of steam which can
be generated by the boiler in a given time, is quite sure to fall into
disuse or be abandoned. It is of course often necessary to adapt the
appliances for burning fuel to the fuel itself; and when a poor quality
of the latter must be used, more boiler capacity must be given than is
needed to do the same work with better fuel.

The table in the appendix will no doubt be valuable as indicating the
properties and relative value of several different kinds of fuel used
in this country. The table is copied from a report made to the Navy
Department of the United States by Professor Walter B. Johnson in
1844, and the conclusions are deduced from a series of very elaborate
experiments made for the Navy Department. This report furnishes the
most full and reliable data regarding the value of American fuel
thus far (1874) published; but it contains little or no information
concerning the fuels which are now used on railroads in our Western
States. The first eight specimens of coal given in the table are
anthracite; all the rest are bituminous coals.




PART XX.

THE RESISTANCE OF TRAINS.


QUESTION 407. _What is meant by the resistance of trains or cars?_

_Answer._ It is the power required to move them on the track. Thus if a
rope, fig. 219, was attached to a car at one end, and the other passed
over a pulley, _a_, and a sufficiently heavy weight, _W_, was hung on
the end of the rope, it would move the car. The weight _W_ would then
be equal to the resistance of the car.

[Illustration: Fig. 219.]

QUESTION 408. _How can the resistance of cars under different
circumstances be determined?_

_Answer._ It has been found that it takes a force of about 6 lbs. per
ton (of 2,000 lbs.) to move a car slowly on a level and straight track
after it is started. That is, if a car weighs 20 tons and a rope, fig.
219, is attached to it at one end and the other passed over a pulley,
_a_, with a weight, _W_, suspended to it, it will require a weight
equal to 20 × 6 = 120 lbs. to keep the car moving slowly. If two cars
of the above weight were coupled together, it would require twice 120
or 240 lbs., and if three were attached to each other, three times 120,
or 360 lbs., and so on. In other words, MULTIPLYING THE TOTAL WEIGHT OF
THE CARS IN TONS (OF 2,000 LBS.) BY 6 WILL GIVE US THEIR RESISTANCE, OR
THE FORCE REQUIRED TO KEEP THEM MOVING ON A LEVEL AND STRAIGHT TRACK AT
A SLOW SPEED AFTER THEY ARE STARTED. The resistance is represented by
the weight above, and the locomotive must exert a force equal to that
weight to keep the train moving. As the speed increases the resistance
increases, as is shown by the following table. It should be stated
here, however, that our knowledge regarding this whole subject of
the resistance of American cars and trains is exceedingly inaccurate
and imperfect, and the data given in the books are nearly all based
on experiments made in Europe, with cars of a different construction
from those used here. There is reason for believing, however, that the
resistance of American cars is less than that of European cars, and we
have assumed it to be 6 lbs. per ton on a level at very slow speed,
which is less than the resistance which is usually given, but the
following figures should be regarded merely as an approximation to the
actual facts, of which we are still in ignorance:

  ================+===+===+===+===+===+====+====+====+====+====+==+====
  Velocity of     |   |   |   |   |   |    |    |    |    |    |  |

  ================+===+===+===+===+===+====+====+====+====+====+==+====

Now, if we want to get the resistance at 30 miles an hour of a train
of ten cars weighing each 20 tons, the calculation would be 10 × 20
× 11¹⁄₄ = 2,250 lbs. This will give the resistance on a level and
straight track. On an ascending grade the resistance is greater than
that given above, because, besides pulling the car horizontally, it is
necessary to raise it vertically a distance equal to the ascent of the
grade. Thus if we have a grade with a rise of forty feet in a mile, the
amount of energy required to simply raise the weight of a car would
be equal to its weight in pounds multiplied by the vertical height of
the ascent. Thus, supposing a car which weighs 40,000 lbs. to be run
one mile on a grade of forty feet ascent in that distance, then the
energy expended in simply raising the car will be equal to 40,000 × 40
= 1,600,000 foot-pounds. Now, if it was necessary to raise that weight
by a direct vertical lift or pull, it would require a force equal to
or a little greater than the load to do it. But in pulling a car or
train up a grade, which is an inclined plane, the force, which is the
locomotive, instead of being exerted through the vertical distance is
exerted through the horizontal distance, which in this case is one
mile, or 5,280 feet. Therefore, if we divide the number of foot-pounds
of energy required by the distance through which the power is exerted,
it will give us the force exerted through one foot. That is,

  1,600,000
  --------- = 151.5 lbs.
    5,280

The resistance due to the ascent alone of a train on a grade or incline
can therefore be calculated by MULTIPLYING THE WEIGHT OF THE TRAIN IN
POUNDS BY THE ASCENT IN ANY GIVEN DISTANCE IN FEET AND DIVIDING THE
PRODUCT BY THE HORIZONTAL DISTANCE IN FEET. Thus in the above example
the rate of the ascent is given in so many feet per mile; we therefore
multiply by 40 and divide by 5,280, which is the number of feet in a
mile. If the rate of the gradient had been given, as it sometimes is,
as 1 in 132, we would simply have divided the weight of the train by
the latter number. If we want to get the resistance per ton of train we
substitute for its weight that of one ton in pounds; thus:

  2,000 × 40
  ---------- = 15.1 lbs.
    5,280

If, now, we have the resistance which is due to the _ascent or gravity
alone_, we must add to this the resistance on a straight and level
track, at the speed at which the train runs, in order to determine the
total resistance on the grade. On a level road at a speed of 5 miles
per hour it would be 6.1 lbs. per ton, so that on a grade of forty feet
to a mile at that speed the resistance would be 6.1 + 15.1 = 21.2 lbs.,
per ton, and at 10 miles it would be 6.6 + 15.1 = 21.7 lbs., and at 30
miles per hour on the grade the resistance would be 11.2 + 15.1 = 26.3
lbs. per ton. To get the total resistance on a grade for any speed, we
ADD THE RESISTANCE FOR THAT SPEED ON A STRAIGHT AND LEVEL LINE TO THE
RESISTANCE DUE TO THE ASCENT ALONE. The resistances for various rates
of speed and grades has been calculated, and is given in the table in
the appendix.

The top horizontal row of figures of that table gives the rates of
speed. The left-hand vertical row gives the rise of grade in feet per
mile. The resistance for any given grade and speed is given where the
vertical row of figures under the rate of speed and the horizontal
row opposite the rise of the grade intersect each other. Thus, for a
grade of 30 feet per mile and a speed of 45 miles per hour, we follow
the vertical column under the 45 downward, and the horizontal column
opposite 30 to the right, and where the two intersect the resistance,
29.1 lbs. is given.

QUESTION 409. _What effect do curves have on the resistance of trains?_

_Answer._ They increase the resistance, but in what proportion or to
what degree is not known accurately. European authorities say that the
resistance is increased, over what it would be in a straight and level
line, about 1 per cent. for every degree of the curve occupied by a
train. It is probable, however, that the resistance of American cars,
which nearly all have double trucks, is not so great on curves as that
of European cars, which nearly all have long and rigid wheel-bases,
and whose wheels therefore can not adjust themselves so easily to the
curvature of the track as they can when the American system of double
trucks is used.

QUESTION 410. _What is meant by a degree of a curve?_

_Answer._ In order to measure circles, they are all supposed to be
divided into 360 equal parts, which are called degrees. One degree of
a curve is therefore ¹⁄₃₆₀ of a complete circle; but if the curve has
a long radius, one degree of such a curved track will be longer than
one degree of a curve with a short radius, but each will have the same
amount of “bend” or curvature. It is this latter which increases the
resistance of trains, and the greater the number of degrees of a curve
occupied by a train of cars, the greater will be the “bend” of the
track, and therefore the greater the resistance.

QUESTION 411. _What other causes affect the resistance of trains?_

_Answer._ The condition of the track and the force and direction of the
wind. On a rough track the resistance is very much greater than on a
smooth one, and a strong head-wind makes it much more difficult to pull
a train than it is in calm weather.




PART XXI.

PROPORTIONS OF LOCOMOTIVES.


QUESTION 412. _In proportioning a locomotive to any given kind of work,
what are the first facts which should be known?_

_Answer._ We should first know the weight of the train which the
locomotive must draw; second, the speed at which it must run; and
third, the steepest grades and the shortest curves of the road on which
it must work. From these data the resistance of the train which the
locomotive must overcome can be at least approximately determined.

QUESTION 413. _When the greatest resistance of the train is known, what
is the next thing to be determined?_

_Answer._ As was stated in answer to Question 66, if the wheels revolve
and their adhesion is greater than the resistance opposed to the
movement of the locomotive, the latter will overcome the resistance;
but if the latter is greater than the friction, the wheels will slip.
It therefore follows that the adhesion must be somewhat greater than
the resistance. As the adhesion is equal to about one-fifth[100] of
the adhesive weight or pressure of the driving-wheels on the rails,
obviously this weight should be five times the resistance. Thus, if
we have a train weighing 400 tons which we want to take up a grade of
40 feet per mile at a speed of 20 miles per hour, its resistance,
calculated from the table given in the previous part, would be 9,360
lbs. Therefore, 9,360 × 5 = 46,800 lbs. = the required adhesive weight.

  [100] See answer to Question 309.

QUESTION 414. _What considerations determine the manner of distributing
this weight on the wheels?_

_Answer._ It is found by experience that if too much weight is placed
upon one wheel, the material of which the rails are made is partly
crushed and injured, and they then wear out much more rapidly than they
would if the weight was distributed on more wheels, and thus a smaller
amount of weight rested on each point of contact with the rails. The
amount of weight which can be carried on a single wheel depends upon
the material of which the rails are made, and to some extent on their
form and size, or as the latter is usually expressed, on their weight
per yard.

QUESTION 415. _When the adhesive weight and the number of
driving-wheels are known, how is the size of the latter and of the
cylinders determined?_

_Answer._ The size of the wheels will to a certain extent depend
upon the speed, because the larger the wheels, the further will the
locomotive move in one revolution; but no exact rule can be given for
their size. At present there is still a great diversity of opinion
among engineers regarding the best sizes of wheels and cylinders for
any given service. Probably the safest plan will be to consult the best
practice, and in the absence of any better reasons be guided for the
present by that. In this country the most common size of locomotives
used is that which we have selected for our illustrations, that is,
what are called five-feet wheels, and cylinders of 16 inches diameter
and 24 inches stroke. More engines of these dimensions are used than
of any other. For freight service the wheels are sometimes made of
smaller and for passenger trains of larger diameter; but locomotives
with driving-wheels and cylinders of the dimensions given are used
for both passenger and freight service. It should be stated here that
what are called five-feet wheels are usually about 1¹⁄₂ in. larger in
diameter than five feet. This arose from the fact that the tires which
are now used are made thicker than they were on the first engines, and
the practice thus established has been continued. We will therefore
take the diameter of what is called a five-feet wheel at what it
really is, 61¹⁄₂ in. Such locomotives also have about 40,000 lbs. of
adhesive weight. Now, the circumference of such wheels is 193.2 in.,
and therefore in one revolution of the wheels, if they do not slip,
the locomotive will move that distance on the rails. At the same time
each piston will sweep through the cylinder twice, and therefore in one
revolution 4 times one cylinder full of steam is used. Now a cylinder
of 16 in. diameter and 24 in. stroke contains or will hold 4,825¹⁄₂
cubic inches, so that in one revolution of the wheels 4,825¹⁄₂ × 4
= 19,302 cubic inches of steam are used. As has been stated, in one
revolution of the wheels, if they do not slip, the locomotive will
move 193.2 in. If, now, we divide 19,302 by 193.2 it will give us the
amount of steam used to move the locomotive and train one inch. Now,
19,302 ÷ 193.2 = 99.9, which, for the sake of even figures we will call
100. We thus see that a locomotive with 40,000 pounds or 20 tons (of
2,000 lbs.) of adhesive weight requires 100 cubic inches of cylinder
capacity[101] to move it one inch. Now, if a locomotive had only half
as much weight on the driving-wheels, it could pull only half as much
load, and would therefore use only half as much steam, and consequently
need only half the cylinder capacity of the other locomotive. If there
was three-quarters or a third as much adhesive weight, the cylinder
capacity should also be three-quarters or a third. We thus see that the
cylinder capacity should be proportioned to the total adhesive weight.
Now as 100 cubic inches of cylinder capacity are needed to move an
engine with 20 tons adhesive weight one inch, if we divide 100 by 20
we will get the cylinder capacity needed for each ton. That is, 100 ÷
20 = 5 CUBIC IN. CYLINDER CAPACITY PER TON (of 2,000 lbs.) OF ADHESIVE
WEIGHT IS NEEDED TO MOVE ANY LOCOMOTIVE ONE INCH. This quantity we have
named the _modulus of propulsion_.

  [101] The cylinder capacity is the space swept through by the two
  pistons. In the above illustrations what is meant is, that the
  average space in the cylinder swept through by the piston is 100
  cubic inches for each inch that the locomotive advances.

Supposing now that it is required to calculate the cylinder capacity
for a locomotive with 15 tons adhesive weight, and wheels 4¹⁄₂ feet
or 54 in. in diameter. We will first multiply 15 by the modulus of
propulsion, 15 × 5 = 75 = the number of cubic inches of cylinder
capacity required to move such a locomotive one inch. Multiplying the
length of the circumference of the wheels, which in this case is 169.6
in. by 75, will give us the total cylinder capacity for one revolution.
That is 169.6 × 75 = 12,720 cubic inches of cylinder capacity, or
the space which should be swept through by the two pistons. Dividing
this by 4 will give us the cubical contents in inches of one of the
cylinders. Thus, 12,720 ÷ 4 = 3,180 cubic inches = the capacity of
one cylinder. Now as the capacity of a cylinder is calculated by
multiplying the area of the piston by the length of the stroke, if we
have the one we can easily determine the other. Thus, supposing it was
intended to make the stroke of the pistons 22 in., dividing 3,180 by 22
will give us the area of the piston. Thus, 3,180 ÷ 22 = 144.5 square
inches. Now by the well-known rule in mensuration, if we DIVIDE THE
AREA OF A CIRCLE BY 0.7854, THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE QUOTIENT WILL BE
THE DIAMETER OF THE CIRCLE. Thus, 144.5 ÷ 0.7854 = 183.9. The square
root of 183.9 is 13¹⁄₂ nearly, which should be the diameter of the
cylinder. Instead of calculating the diameter of the circle, a more
convenient way is to refer the area to a table of areas, and from it
find the diameter. Of course if we have the diameter of the piston and
want to get the stroke, we DIVIDE THE CUBICAL CONTENTS OF THE CYLINDER
BY THE AREA OF THE PISTON. Thus, in the present illustration, if it was
intended to have the piston 13¹⁄₂ in. diameter, we would have divided
3,180 by the area of a piston 13¹⁄₂ in. diameter, which is 143.1, so
that we would have 3,180 ÷ 143.1 = 22 nearly, = inches of stroke of
piston.

From the above considerations we can deduce the following RULE FOR
CALCULATING THE CAPACITY OF THE CYLINDERS WHEN THE ADHESIVE WEIGHT IS
KNOWN:

MULTIPLY THE TOTAL WEIGHT ON THE DRIVING-WHEELS IN TONS (of 2,000 lbs.)
BY 5, AND THEN BY THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE WHEELS IN INCHES, AND DIVIDE
BY 4. THE QUOTIENT WILL BE THE CUBICAL CONTENTS IN INCHES OF EACH
CYLINDER. From this, if either the diameter or stroke is given the
other can easily be found, as has been explained.

It should be remarked here that it is unimportant, so far as the power
of the locomotive is concerned, whether the cylinders have a large
diameter and a short stroke or a small diameter and a long stroke,
provided the cubical contents are the same. Thus cylinders 17¹⁄₂
in. in diameter and with 20 in. stroke would have almost exactly
the same capacity and the same power would be exerted with them as
with cylinders 16 × 24 in.; the only difference would be that with
the cylinder of the largest diameter the pressure on the piston and
consequently on the crank-pin journal and the strain on the parts would
be greater than with the smaller cylinder. The difference in pressure
would, however, be exactly compensated by the loss or gain in the
leverage exerted through the driving-wheels on the rails.

QUESTION 416. _What circumstances should determine the size of
locomotive boilers?_

_Answer._ They should be proportioned to the amount of adhesive weight,
and to the speed at which the locomotive is intended to work. Thus,
a locomotive with a great deal of weight on the driving-wheels could
pull a heavier load and would, by the above rule for proportioning
the cylinders, have a greater cylinder capacity than one with little
adhesive weight, and would therefore consume more steam, and therefore
should have a larger boiler. It is also obvious that if a locomotive
like that shown in plates I and II should have a boiler just large
enough to furnish steam when running at the rate of 20 miles an
hour, it would be too small if the locomotive ran 40 miles an hour,
the train resistance being the same in both cases. Driving-wheels 5
feet in diameter would at 20 miles per hour make 112 revolutions per
minute, and would therefore consume 448 cylinders full of steam. At
40 miles per hour double the number of revolutions would be made, and
consequently twice the quantity of steam would be used, and therefore
the boiler should have twice the steam-producing capacity. If,
therefore, we know the size of a boiler required for a given amount of
adhesive weight and a given speed, we can easily calculate the boiler
capacity for any other weight and speed.

QUESTION 417. _How can we determine the boiler capacity needed for an
engine with a given amount of adhesive weight and for a given speed?_

_Answer_. This must be determined empirically, that is from experience.

QUESTION 418. _On what does the steam-generating capacity of a boiler
depend?_

_Answer_. First, upon the size of its grate and fire-box, because more
fuel can be burned in a large fire-place than in a small one; second,
on the amount of heating surface to which the products of combustion
are exposed, and third, on the draft produced by the blast or exhaust
steam. Of course the amount of steam generated is also dependent upon
a great variety of other circumstances, such as the nature of the
combustion, the firing, the arrangement of the fire-box, grates, etc.,
and the condition of the heating surfaces; but these have nothing to do
with the proportions or size of the boiler.

QUESTION 419. _What are the proportions of boilers used in locomotives
like that which has been illustrated in these articles and represented
in Plates I and II?_

_Answer_. The area of the grate is about 2,100 square inches and the
total heating surface about 800 square feet, and the water capacity
about 5,000 lbs., and the total weight of the boiler, including all
the boiler attachments and appliances for promoting combustion, about
30,000 lbs.

QUESTION 420. _At what speed are such engines usually run?_

_Answer_. The speed varies so much under different circumstances, that
it is impossible to give even approximately the average speed of such
engines.

QUESTION 421. _How then can we determine the proper proportions of a
boiler for a locomotive intended for any given service?_

_Answer_. As stated before, this can only be done empirically. The
safest method is to select a locomotive which is doing the best
service, and learn the average speed at which it runs, the size of its
grate and the amount of its heating surface, and its adhesive weight.
NOW MULTIPLY THE ABOVE SPEED IN MILES PER HOUR BY THE ADHESIVE WEIGHT
OF THE LOCOMOTIVE IN TONS (of 2,000 lbs.) AND DIVIDE THE PRODUCT INTO
THE AREA OF THE GRATE IN SQUARE INCHES. THEN MULTIPLY THE ADHESIVE
WEIGHT OF THE LOCOMOTIVE FOR WHICH THE BOILER IS TO BE PROVIDED BY
ITS SPEED, IN MILES PER HOUR, AND BY THE QUOTIENT OBTAINED ABOVE: THE
PRODUCT WILL BE THE AREA OF THE GRATE IN SQUARE INCHES FOR THE NEW
ENGINE. To illustrate this, suppose an engine of the dimensions given
to run at an average speed of 20 miles per hour. Now, multiplying that
speed by the number of tons of adhesive weight and dividing the product
into the area of the grate, we have 20 × 20 = 400 and 2100 ÷ 400 =
5.25. We now want to determine the size of a grate for the boiler of
a locomotive with 30 tons adhesive weight and to run at a speed of 15
miles per hour. We therefore multiply 15 by 30 and the product by the
above quotient, or 15 × 30 × 5.25 = 2,362.5 = square inches of grate
surface for the boiler. The required heating surface can be obtained in
a similar way, by substituting it instead of the grate surface in the
calculations.

QUESTION 422. _How is the size of locomotive boilers usually limited?_

_Answer_. By the weight of the locomotive and to some extent by
the distance between the rails. It will be found often that it is
impossible to make the boiler of the size indicated by a calculation
similar to the above without at the same time making the weight of the
locomotive and the adhesive weight greater than was assumed. The result
of such a calculation indicates, therefore, that too large a proportion
of the weight of the locomotive is on the driving-wheels for the speed
at which it is intended to work, and that either they should bear less
weight or the speed be reduced.

QUESTION 423. _In what respects is the operation of locomotive boilers
different from that of nearly all other steam boilers?_

_Answer_. The amount of steam generated in proportion to the amount
of heating surface is much greater in locomotive boilers than in any
other kind. To produce combustion which will be sufficiently active to
generate the requisite quantity of steam, the fire must be stimulated
by the blast created by the exhaust steam to a degree unknown in
other kinds of boilers. So rapid is the movement of the products of
combustion that a smaller proportion of the heat is imparted to the
water contained in the boiler, and consequently a less amount of water
is evaporated in proportion to any given amount of fuel than in boilers
in which combustion is less violent. The combustion is also less
perfect, because the strong draft does not allow time for a perfect
combination of the gases which produce combustion.

The supply of steam which a locomotive boiler must furnish is also much
more irregular than the demands made upon any other kind of boiler. At
one time the fire must be urged to the greatest possible intensity in
order to furnish steam enough to pull a train up a steep grade. When
the top is reached the demand ceases, and the boiler can be cooled. The
load which a locomotive can pull over a given line of road is usually
limited by the utmost capacity of the boiler to supply steam at these
critical periods.

QUESTION 424. _What relation is there between this irregular action and
the size of the boiler?_

_Answer_. The smaller the boiler, or rather the larger the amount of
steam which must be generated in a given time in proportion to the
heating surface, the more must the fire be urged; and therefore the
smaller the boiler in proportion to the work it must do, the less will
be its economy. In order to produce a rapid combustion in a small
boiler, it is necessary to contract the exhaust nozzles in order to
create a draft strong enough. In doing this the back pressure on the
pistons is very much increased, and when the blast becomes very violent
a great deal of solid coal is carried through the tubes and escapes
at the smoke-stack unconsumed. At the same time large quantities of
unconsumed gases escape, because there is not time for combustion to
take place in the fire-box. The fact that with a violent draft the
flame and smoke are in contact with the heating surface for a sensibly
shorter period of time also has its influence; as less heat will be
imparted to the water if the products of combustion are only ¹⁄₁₀₀ of a
second instead of ²⁄₁₀₀ in passing through the tubes.

There is another consideration which should be taken into account in
this connection, which is, that if a boiler is so small that it is
worked nearly up to its maximum capacity at all times, it will be
impossible to accumulate any reserve power in it in the form of water
heated to a high temperature to be used as occasion may require. With
a boiler having a great amount of heating surface and capacity for
carrying a large quantity of water, the latter can be heated at times
when the engine is not working hard, and the heat thus stored up in the
water can then be used when it is most needed. Thus we will suppose
that to pull a train of cars on a level 250 lbs. of steam are consumed
per mile. On a grade of 30 feet per mile the resistance will be three
times what it is on a level, and therefore three times the quantity
of steam will be consumed, so that the boiler must then evaporate 750
lbs. of water per mile. Now to convert 250 lbs. of water heated up to
a temperature due to 130 lbs. of effective pressure, or 355.6 degrees,
into steam of that pressure will require 216,575 units of heat. If
at the same time that this steam is being consumed, we pump into the
boiler 250 lbs. of water of a temperature of 60 degrees, 73,900 more
units of heat will be needed to raise the water to the temperature
due to 130 lbs. effective pressure, so that on the level part of the
road it would be necessary to transmit to the water in the boiler
216,575 + 73,900 = 290,475 units of heat in a mile. If there is no
room in the boiler for storing a surplus quantity of hot water, it
will be necessary on a grade as fast as the steam is consumed to feed
an equivalent amount of cold water to take the place of that which was
converted into steam, so that on a 30 feet grade it would be necessary
to convert at the rate of 750 lbs. of hot water into steam in a mile,
which would require 649,725 units of heat, and at the same time heat
an equal amount of cold water to a temperature due to the pressure of
the steam, which would require 221,700 more units. So that it will
be necessary to transmit at the rate of 871,425 units of heat to the
water per mile. Now if the boiler was so large that more water could
be pumped into it and heated than was used on the level portion of the
road, and could there be stored up for future use, the pumps might be
either partly or entirely shut off when the engine was working the
hardest on the grade. In this way, instead of being obliged to convert
hot water into steam, and at the same time heat an equal amount of cold
feed-water, there would be a surplus of hot water stored up already
heated. It would therefore only be necessary to convert this hot water
into steam, which will require a transmission of heat to the water
at the rate of 649,725 units of heat instead of 871,425. It must be
remembered that on nearly all roads there are certain difficult places
which practically limit the capacity of the locomotives on that line.
If therefore the capacity of the engines can be increased at those
points, their capacity over the whole line is increased. It will be
seen by the above illustration that by having a large boiler it is
necessary for it to do very much less work at the critical period,
when, as every locomotive runner knows, it is often of the utmost
importance to make use of every possible available means in order to
pull the trains. It is true that on a very long grade the supply of
surplus hot water would soon be exhausted, but even in such cases
there is usually one place, owing to a curve or other cause, which is
more difficult to surmount than any other, in which case it will be
necessary to use more steam for a short time than the locomotive can
generate if the boiler is fed continuously. For such cases a surplus of
water can be used. But even if the resistance is equal over the whole
length of the incline, still the large boiler will have the advantage,
because it can at all times generate more steam than a smaller one.
It may therefore, we think, safely be assumed that locomotive boilers
should always be made as large as the weight of the locomotive will
permit.

QUESTION 425. _What effect does the size of the driving-wheels have
upon the combustion and evaporation of locomotive boilers?_

_Answer._ As small wheels make more revolutions in running a given
distance than large ones, there will be more strokes of the piston with
the former than with the latter, if the locomotive in both cases runs
at the same speed. As smaller cylinders are usually employed with small
wheels, the blast up the chimney is then composed of a larger number of
discharges of steam, but each one of less quantity, than when larger
wheels and cylinders are used. In the one case the “puffs” of steam are
many and small, and in the latter few and large. If the cylinders are
proportioned by the rule which has been given for that purpose, the
amount of steam discharged in running any given distance will be the
same with engines having large and those with small wheels, the only
difference being that it will be subdivided into a greater number of
discharges in the one case than in the other. Now, it is found that the
draft of engines is much more effective on the fire when the blast is
thus subdivided, that is when small wheels and cylinders are used, than
it is with large ones, and therefore more steam is generated with the
former than with the latter.

QUESTION 426. _What relation is there between the size of the wheels
and that of the boiler?_

_Answer._ As has been explained, the size of the boiler is limited
by the weight of the locomotive. The boiler and its attachments of
an American locomotive, when the former is filled with water, weigh
about half as much as the locomotive; therefore unless we increase the
weight of the latter or decrease the weight of the machinery, we can
not increase the size of the boiler. Now, large wheels are heavier
than small ones; they require larger cylinders, stronger connections,
heavier frames, and in fact nearly all the parts of the machinery used
with large wheels must be heavier than are required when small wheels
are used. Therefore, by decreasing the size of the wheels all the other
parts of the engine proper can be made lighter than is possible if
large wheels are used, and thus the size and weight of the boiler can
be increased without increasing the whole weight of the locomotive.
There is of course a practical limit below which the size of the wheels
can not be reduced, because the speed of the piston would become so
great as to be injurious to the machinery. By reducing the stroke,
however, with the diameter of the wheels, the evil referred to may
be obviated to a great extent. A cylinder with a large diameter and
comparatively small stroke has also the advantage that there is less
surface exposed to radiation of heat than there is in a cylinder in
which these proportions are reversed.




PART XXII.

DIFFERENT KINDS OF LOCOMOTIVES.


QUESTION 427. _Into what classes may locomotives be divided
conveniently?_

_Answer._ 1. Locomotives for “switching,” “shunting” or “drilling”
service, that is, for transferring cars from one place to another at
stations; 2, for freight traffic; 3, for ordinary passenger traffic,
and 4, for suburban or metropolitan railroads, where a great many light
trains are run.

QUESTION 428. _What kinds of locomotives are used in this country for
switching cars at stations?_

[Illustration: Fig. 220.]

_Answer._ Four-wheeled locomotives similar to that shown in Plate IV.
In some cases they are made with six driving-wheels. Engines like that
shown in Plate IV have separate tenders, but they are sometimes made so
as to carry the water-tank and fuel on the locomotive itself, as shown
in fig. 220, and are then called tank locomotives. Fig. 220 represents
a switching engine built by the Taunton Locomotive Manufacturing
Company.

QUESTION 429. _Why are four-wheeled locomotives used for switching?_

_Answer._ Because in such service it is constantly necessary to start
trains, many of which are very heavy, and therefore a great deal of
adhesion is needed. For this reason the whole weight of the locomotive
and in the case of tank locomotives that of the water and fuel is
placed on the driving-wheels. It is also necessary for such locomotives
to run over curves of very short radius and into switches whose angle
with the main track is very great, and therefore in order that they may
do this and remain on the track, their wheel-bases must be very short,
and consequently the wheels are all placed near together between the
smoke-box and fire-box.

QUESTION 430. _Why are such locomotives not suited for general traffic?_

_Answer._ Owing to the shortness of their wheel-bases they become
very unsteady at high speeds, and acquire a pitching motion, similar
to that of a horse-car when running rapidly over a rough track. This
unsteadiness not only becomes very uncomfortable to the men who run the
locomotive, but there is danger of the engine running off the track.
As nearly all switching is done at very slow speeds, it is not so
objectionable for that service as it would be on the “open road”[102]
at high speeds.

  [102] The term “_open road_” is a literal translation from the
  German, for which there is no corresponding English term, and means
  the road between stations where trains run fast.

QUESTION 431. _What kinds of locomotives are used for freight service?_

_Answer._ The greater part of the freight service of this country is
performed by locomotives like that selected for the illustrations
of these articles, and represented in Plates I, II and III. Such
locomotives have been called “American” locomotives because they first
originated in this country and are now more generally used here than
anywhere else. Side elevations of locomotives of this kind, built by
the Baldwin Locomotive Works, the Grant Locomotive Works, the Danforth
Locomotive and Machine Company, the Mason Machine Works and the Hinkley
Locomotive Works are represented in Plates V, VI, VII, VIII and IX.
Such locomotives have been described in the preceding pages.

QUESTION 432. _What are the dimensions of such engines?_

_Answer._ The principal dimensions of the engines illustrated are given
in the table in the appendix, but locomotives of this plan are built
of much smaller and also of larger sizes than those represented by the
engravings. In some cases such locomotives do not weigh more than 35 or
36,000 lbs., with cylinders from 8 to 12 inches in diameter. In other
cases they weigh as much as 66,000 lbs., with cylinders 17 or 18 inches
in diameter. The wheels vary from 4 to 6 feet in diameter, but the most
common sizes are 4¹⁄₂ and 5 feet.

QUESTION 433. _When it is desirable to pull heavier loads than
is possible with the adhesive weight that can be placed on four
driving-wheels, what is done?_

_Answer._ One or more pairs of driving-wheels are added, as in
the ten-wheeled locomotive represented in Plate X, the “Mogul”
engine, Plate XI, and the “Consolidation” engine, Plate XII. The
ten-wheeled locomotive, it will be seen, is similar in construction
to an ordinary American locomotive, excepting that it has another
pair of driving-wheels in front of the main driving-wheels. It will
be seen, however, that it is necessary to keep these close to the
latter, because if they are brought further forward they will be too
near the back truck-wheels. For this reason a truck consisting of a
single pair of wheels, _A_, _A_, is placed in front of the cylinders,
as represented in Plates XI and XII, is now much used. The front
driving-wheels are then placed further forward, and thus bear a larger
proportion of weight than they do in locomotives like that shown in
Plate X.

QUESTION 434. _How are trucks with a single pair of wheels constructed?_

_Answer._ The truck frame is extended some distance behind the
truck-axle, as shown in fig. 221, and the centre-pin, _a_, about which
it vibrates, is placed at the back end. The weight of the locomotive,
or that portion to be carried on the truck, is then made to rest over
the centre of the axle, but in such a way that it can move laterally
or crosswise over the track. Such trucks were first made so that the
weight of the engine rested on slides on the truck frame, but recently
they are nearly always suspended on links, so that they can swing like
a pendulum, as shown in figs. 190 and 191. The weight of the engine
then rests on the centre-plate, _H H_; which forms part of the plate,
_B B_. This is suspended by links, _L L_, represented by dotted lines,
which are attached by bolts to the cross-pieces, _m m_, which are
fastened to the truck frame. In this way the truck-wheels can move
sideways independent of the engine itself. As the wheels and axles, _A
A_, must move about the centre-pin, _a_, fig. 221, the axle assumes a
radial position to the curves of the track. It does this, too, quite
independent of the driving-wheels, as is shown in fig. 221, which
represents a plan of the wheels on a curve. It will be seen that the
truck is not at all influenced by the position of the driving-wheels.
This arrangement therefore gives great flexibility to the wheel-base,
and enables the wheels to adjust themselves to any lateral curvature or
alignment of the track.

[Illustration: Fig. 221. Scale ¹⁄₈ in. = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 435. _For what purpose are locomotives like that shown in
Plates XI and XII used?_

_Answer._ “Mogul” locomotives are often used for ordinary freight
service where heavy trains must be hauled, and also on steep grades.
“Consolidation” locomotives, represented in Plate XII, which have eight
driving-wheels, are employed almost exclusively for traffic over heavy
mountain grades.

QUESTION 436. _What other kinds of locomotives are used for freight
traffic?_

_Answer._ Various kinds of tank locomotives, that is, locomotives which
have no separate tenders, but carry the water-tanks and fuel on the
frame and wheels of the locomotive itself, have been devised and are to
some extent used. Plate XIII represents a locomotive of this kind on
which the tanks are placed on each side of the boiler, and the fuel on
a Bissell truck at the back end. A similar truck is placed at the front
end, so that a locomotive of this kind can run equally well either way.
The lateral movement of the two trucks also gives great flexibility to
the wheel-base, so that such an engine will adjust itself easily to
the curvature of the track. If, however, the two pairs of truck-wheels
should both stand on an elevated part of the track, and the
driving-wheels on a depression, the latter would evidently not carry as
much and the truck-wheels would carry more of the weight of the engine
than they did on a level part of the track. If the reverse condition
of things should occur, that is, if the driving-wheels should be on an
elevation and one or both pairs of the truck-wheels on a depression,
then the latter would bear less weight than they did and the
driving-wheels more. For this reason, in order to distribute the weight
evenly on all the wheels, it is necessary to equalize the weight on the
truck and driving-wheels, by connecting them with equalizing levers,
similar to those which were described in answer to Question 301. These
levers distribute any undue weight which may come on one wheel to that
next to it. This is important, because if the driving-wheels bore less
weight at some times than at others, their adhesion and their capacity
to draw loads would be reduced in like proportion.

It is evident, however, that if the water-tank or fuel is carried on
the driving-wheels, there will be a greater weight on them when the
tank is full than when it is empty, and that therefore there will
either be so much weight on the wheels at one time as to be injurious
to the rails, or else there will be too little for adhesion at another.
Of course cases are conceivable, and doubtless exist in practice, where
more adhesion is required to start a train and haul it during the
first part of the “run” than will be needed during the latter part. In
such cases doubtless the variable character of the weight might be an
advantage instead of the reverse, but for ordinary practice a variable
load on the driving-wheels would have the disadvantages which have been
described. For this reason tank locomotives have been built like that
represented in Plate XIV. In this it will be seen that the weight of
the water-tank rests on a four-wheeled truck at the back end. A Bissell
or two-wheeled truck is, however, placed in front in the same position
as in the engine represented in Plate XIII, and carries a portion of
the weight of the boiler and machinery.

In order to get all the advantages which a four-wheeled switching
engine possesses in having its _whole_ weight on the driving-wheels,
and at the same time avoid the disadvantages which result from a
short wheel-base, and also from a varying amount of weight on the
driving-wheels, a locomotive like that represented in Plate XV was
designed by the writer with the whole weight of the boiler and
machinery resting on the driving-wheels, and the water and fuel on a
truck. By this means not only the objections to carrying the weight
of the water on the driving-wheels is overcome, but at the same time
the disadvantages arising from the short wheel-base of the switching
locomotive, Plate IV, are also obviated. That is, all the _permanent
weight_ of the boiler and machinery of such a locomotive rests on the
driving-wheels, and is therefore all _adhesive weight_, as it is in the
switching engine, and at the same time by extending the frame beyond
the fire-box and placing the water-tank and fuel on this extension
of the frame and supporting their weight on a truck, the engine has
a wheel-base which is as long and as flexible as that of ordinary
American engines, represented in Plates V, VI, VII, VIII and IX, and
as the latter have only about _two-thirds_ of their weight on the
driving-wheels, locomotives like that represented in Plate XV, of the
same weight as the others, have fifty per cent. more adhesion, or they
may be one-third lighter and have the same adhesion. As was explained
in answer to Question 260, if an ordinary American locomotive runs
backwards, that is, with the driving-wheels in front, the friction of
their flanges against the rails on curves of short radius will be very
excessive. To avoid this with locomotives of the design last described,
they are run with the truck first, which, being at the opposite end
of the boiler from the position which it usually occupies, reverses
the position of the boiler and other parts relative to the motion of
the engine. That is, the fire-box is then in front and the smoke-stack
behind. Engines of this kind have been built and are now working and
doing excellent service; but the prejudice which exists against running
locomotives in the reverse direction to what has been customary seems
to be the chief obstacle in the way of their use.

Another plan which possesses all the advantages of the locomotive
described above and is free from the last objection is represented
in Plate XVI. This plan was first adopted by Mr. Robert Fairlie in
England, but has been introduced into this country and very much
improved by Mr. William Mason, of Taunton, Mass. In these locomotives,
the driving-wheels and cylinders are attached to a truck frame which
turns around a centre-pin like any ordinary truck. The steam and
exhaust pipes are connected to the boiler and cylinder with pipes which
have flexible joints. By this means the truck can move independently
of the boiler, and thus the driving-wheels can adjust themselves to
the curvature of the track, just as the wheels of any other truck do,
and therefore the driving-wheels can be run ahead just as well as the
truck-wheels which carry the tank. This plan possesses the additional
advantage that the fire-box can be made as wide and as long as may
be desired without interfering with the driving-wheels. The flexible
pipes are, however, usually considered an objection; but with the
improvements which have been made in their design and construction,
the difficulties which were at first encountered have probably been
overcome. At any rate if there is no other objection to the use of such
locomotives, ingenuity and care should in time overcome that one. Plate
XVII represents a locomotive of this plan, with six driving-wheels
and a six-wheeled carrying truck under the tank. This latter plan of
locomotive is intended for heavy freight traffic.

QUESTION 437. _What kind of locomotives is used for passenger trains?_

_Answer._ Eight-wheeled American locomotives are used almost
exclusively for passenger service. Usually the driving-wheels of
such locomotives are larger in diameter than are used for freight
traffic. Their size varies from 5 feet to 5 ft. 9 in. in diameter. The
locomotive by the Mason Machine Works represented in Plate VIII has
5¹⁄₂ feet driving-wheels. For very heavy express trains locomotives
with 17 × 24 inch cylinders and weighing 34 tons are now used on many
through lines.

QUESTION 438. _What is meant by suburban and metropolitan railroads,
what is the nature of their traffic, and what kinds of locomotives are
needed for it?_

_Answer._ The traffic of suburban railroads consists chiefly of the
transportation of passengers who do business in the city to the latter
in the morning and to their homes in the evening. As the largest
number of passengers must be carried during a few hours in the morning
and evening, it is necessary to run very heavy trains at those times.
As the passengers must be distributed at many stations which are near
together, it is necessary to stop often; and in order that the average
speed may be reasonably fast the trains must run very rapidly between
these stations. It is therefore necessary to have heavy locomotives,
with more than the usual proportion of adhesive weight, so that the
trains can be started quickly without slipping the wheels. The main
valves should also have a liberal amount of travel, so that steam will
be admitted to and exhausted from the cylinders quickly. In some cases
it is thought desirable to have locomotives which will run equally well
either way, so that it will not be necessary to turn them around at
each end of the “run.”

By metropolitan railroads are meant railroads in large cities. They
may be divided into two classes, one for carrying freight cars from
the outskirts of cities to the warehouses and stores at their business
centres, and also from the terminus of one road to that of another.
Metropolitan railroads of this kind are usually branches of lines
which extend from the city. Locomotives for such traffic must have
great tractive power, in order to pull heavy trains, and as the speed
is usually slow the wheels and the boiler capacity may be small.
They must generally be capable of running through curves of very
short radius; and as the traffic is usually carried through streets
in close proximity to buildings, the locomotives should be as nearly
as possible noiseless. The other class of metropolitan roads is for
carrying passengers. The traffic of the latter is similar to that
usually carried on horse railroads, and consists almost exclusively of
passengers. At present (1874) there are only one or two metropolitan
railroads in this country for carrying passengers which are operated by
steam power. It seems certain, however, that their use will soon become
very general in all large cities. Their traffic will consist of many
light trains run at short intervals and at comparatively slow speeds,
and therefore very light locomotives are required.

QUESTION 439. _What kinds of locomotives are used for suburban
railroads?_

_Answer._ The ordinary American eight-wheeled locomotive is used
more than any other kind; but a number of locomotives like that
represented by fig. 222 have been built and are used for this traffic.
These have one pair of driving-wheels in front of the main pair and
a Bissell truck in front of the cylinder. With this arrangement the
driving-wheels bear a larger proportion of weight than they do if
arranged on the ordinary American plan with a four-wheeled truck.
Another plan is that shown in Plate XVIII. Such engines, as will be
seen, have a Bissell truck at each end, and therefore they run equally
well either way. In some cases the tanks of such engines are carried on
the top and sides of the boiler. When they are obliged to run only a
short distance, and a small supply of water is needed, this arrangement
answers very well; but it is impossible to carry a large supply of
water in this way without overloading the wheels of the locomotive,
and at the same time increasing the evils of a varying load on the
driving-wheels.

[Illustration: Fig. 222.

LIGHT PASSENGER AND FREIGHT LOCOMOTIVE, BY THE GRANT LOCOMOTIVE WORKS,
PATERSON, N. J.]

Locomotives like that shown in Plate XIV are also used for suburban
traffic. As shown in the engraving they have a four-wheeled truck at
one end and one with two wheels at the other, so that it is thought
that they can be run safely either way. The four-wheeled truck carries
the weight of the water and fuel.

The plan of engine represented by Plate XV is very well adapted for
this kind of traffic. Excepting on curves with a very short radius
it could be run in either direction at any required speed, without
encountering any other difficulty excepting the prejudices of those who
run it.

As double-truck locomotives similar to that shown in Plate XVI can
adjust themselves to any curve, this objection could not be urged
against their use.

QUESTION 440. _What kinds of locomotives are used on metropolitan
railroads?_

_Answer._ For freight traffic ordinary switching locomotives like that
represented in Plate IV are often employed. In some cases these have
the tanks on the locomotives. It often happens, though, that such
traffic must be conducted in the streets of a city, and that the noise,
especially of the exhausting steam, is thus liable to frighten horses
and disturb the occupants. It is, then, necessary either to condense
the exhaust steam or render its escape noiseless, which is done by
allowing it to escape into the water-tanks. Street locomotives which
have a condenser similar to the surface condensers used on marine
engines are used on the Hudson River Railroad in New York. The exhaust
steam passes through these and then escapes into the tanks. The latter
are long and narrow, so as to expose a great deal of surface to
radiation, and in this way cool the water which becomes heated by the
steam. The engines have four driving-wheels and vertical boilers. The
cylinders are connected to a crank shaft with a pinion on it, which
gears with another wheel of larger size on the driving-axle. In this
way the speed is reduced and great tractive power can be exerted. The
whole of the engine is enclosed so as to hide the machinery, the sight
of which is supposed to frighten horses. The engines were designed and
patented by Mr. A. F. Smith, formerly Master Mechanic of that road.

For roads in cities carrying passengers almost exclusively, an entirely
different class of locomotives is needed. To suit passengers it is of
course necessary to run a great many trains at very short intervals.
When this is done the trains are necessarily very light, and therefore
only light locomotives are needed. Plate XIX represents the locomotives
employed on the Greenwich Street Elevated Railroad in New York. These
engines weigh only 10,000 lbs., and the wheels are 30 in. diameter
and the cylinders 7 × 10 in. The peculiarity in their construction
consists in their having an intermediate shaft between the two pairs
of driving-wheels. This shaft has two cranks inside of the frames and
two outside. The cylinders are connected to the inside cranks, and the
coupling-rods to those on the outside. The water is carried in a tank
on top of the boiler. The fuel is anthracite coal.




PART XXIII.

CONTINUOUS TRAIN BRAKES.


QUESTION 441. _What are meant by automatic or continuous train brakes?_

_Answer._ Continuous train brakes are brakes which can be applied to
all the cars of a train by the locomotive runner on the locomotive. In
some cases such brakes are arranged in such a way that they can also be
applied from any car in the train, or are made self-acting in case of
an accident, such as a car getting off the track or a train breaking in
two.

QUESTION 442. _What are the principal systems of brakes of this kind in
use?_

_Answer._ What is called, after its inventor, the Westinghouse
atmospheric brake is now used more than any other. Next to this,
Smith’s vacuum brake is used most. Besides these two, Creamer’s,
Ward’s, Loughridge’s and Henderson’s systems of brakes are used to a
limited extent. The two first are, however, the only ones which have
come into sufficiently extensive use as yet to justify us in describing
them here.

QUESTION 443. _How does the Westinghouse brake act and how is it
constructed?_

_Answer._ As its name indicates, the medium employed for transmitting
the power for operating the brakes is atmospheric air.

[Illustration: Fig. 223. Scale ¹⁄₂ in. = 1 foot.]

This is compressed to any required density by a steam pump which is
located between the driving-wheels, or in any other convenient place on
the locomotive. This pump is shown in section in fig. 223 and consists
of two cylinders, the upper one, _A_, the steam cylinder, the piston of
which is connected by its rod with the piston in the lower cylinder,
_B_. This latter is operated by the steam piston, and at each stroke a
quantity of air, equal to the space swept through by the lower piston,
is compressed and thus forced into a cylindrical reservoir, which is
usually placed under the foot-board of the locomotive, in which it is
stored for use at any time when the brakes are to be applied. The air
and steam cylinders are supplied with suitable valves for admitting
and releasing the air and steam. From this reservoir it is conducted
back under the tender and cars by pipes, which are connected together
between the engine and tender and between the cars by India rubber
hose. Two pieces of hose are attached to the engine and also to each
end of the tender and cars, so that in case one piece should break
the others will act. Each of these pieces is united or coupled to the
corresponding piece opposite to it by a peculiar coupling made for the
purpose, so that they can be quickly disconnected if the cars, engine
or tender are uncoupled.

Under the tender and also under each car is a cylinder and piston. The
compressed air is conducted to this cylinder in front of the piston
when the brakes are to be applied. As the piston-rod is connected by
a bell crank to the brake levers when the piston is forced out by the
pressure of the air, the brakes are at once applied to the wheels. As
the reservoir under the foot-board is connected by the pipes which have
been described with the cylinders under each car and the tender, by
simply opening communication between the reservoir and the pipes, the
air at once rushes from the reservoir back through the whole length of
the train, and so rapid is its motion and quick its action that only a
second or two intervenes between the opening of communication and the
application of the brakes. To relieve or “let off” the brakes it is
only necessary to close the reservoir cock and open communication from
the air-pipes to the external atmosphere, when the compressed air in
the brake cylinders will escape, and the springs ordinarily used on car
brakes will cause the pistons to resume their former positions.

For the purpose of opening the connection from the reservoir to the
brake cylinder, and closing this connection and opening one from the
latter to the external air, a single three-way cock is commonly used.
This is arranged at such a point as to be under the control of the
engineer, so that he can at pleasure turn on the compressed air with
any degree of force, instantaneously, or slowly, or with a varying
power, or by another turn of the cock let it off as freely, still
keeping it under the same complete control.

[Illustration: Fig. 224. Scale 1¹⁄₂ inch = 1 foot.]

QUESTION 444. _How does the vacuum brake act and how is it constructed?_

_Answer._ The power is applied to the brakes of the cars in this system
by exhausting instead of compressing the air. This is done by means
of an ejector, of which fig. 224 is a section. This operates somewhat
like an injector. Steam is admitted into the pipe _B_, and escapes
through the annular or circular opening _a a_. The effect of this is
to create what is called an “induced current,” or to draw the air from
the pipe _C′ C_, which, with the steam, escapes at _A_. This produces
a partial vacuum in the pipe _C_, which extends back under the cars.
The pipes under the cars are connected together by rubber hose, which
are prevented from collapsing by coils of wire inside. Under the tender
and under each car are India rubber cylinders with cast iron ends, one
fastened to the car and the other movable. The rubber cylinders can be
extended or compressed somewhat like the bellows of an accordeon. The
rubber is supported by iron rings inside, placed from 4 to 6 inches
apart, so as to prevent them from collapsing when the air is exhausted
from them. When this is done the pressure on the movable cast iron
end draws it towards the fixed one, and by attaching the former to
the brake levers by a rod, the force of the pressure on the head is
communicated to the brakes.

The ejector is placed on top of the boiler, and when the brakes are
to be applied the locomotive runner opens a valve, which admits steam
into the ejector, which instantly begins to produce a partial vacuum
and thus apply the brakes. When the pressure of the brakes is to be
released, the release valve, _D_, is opened, which admits air into
the pipe, _C_, through which it is conducted back to each of the India
rubber cylinders, and thus counteracts the pressure on the ends and
releases the brakes.

Both the atmospheric and the vacuum brakes have recently been applied
to the driving-wheels of locomotives with very excellent results.




PART XXIV.

PERFORMANCE AND COST OF OPERATING LOCOMOTIVES.


QUESTION 445. _What is the cost of operating ordinary locomotives per
mile run?_

_Answer._ The average cost at the present time (1874) is from 20 to 25
cents per mile.[103]

  [103] Deducting 10 per cent. from this amount will give very nearly
  the gold value of the cost. The figures given above represent
  the cost in the depreciated promises to pay of the United States
  Government.

QUESTION 446. _What items of cost are included in this, and what
proportion do they each bear to the total cost?_

_Answer._ The items of cost and the percentage of each to the whole
expense of operating locomotives, and also to the total of all the
expenses of operating locomotives are given in the following table:

  ======================+===========+============+=============
                        |           |            | Percentage

  ----------------------+-----------+------------+-------------
      Total             | 20.0 cts. |    1.00    |    .20
  ======================+===========+============+=============

From this table it will be seen that the locomotive expenses are 20
per cent. of the whole cost of operating railroads. This cost of course
varies under different circumstances. The above is probably somewhat
lower than the average cost in this country.

QUESTION 447. _How many miles do locomotives ordinarily run per ton of
coal and per cord of wood?_

_Answer._ This also varies greatly under different circumstances. An
average taken from the monthly reports of 52 different roads gives 38
miles run per ton of coal, and an average from the reports of 16 roads
gives 47¹⁄₂ miles run per cord of wood. No deductions should, however,
be made from this of the relative value of wood and coal for fuel,
because the trains which are run with wood for fuel are usually lighter
than those hauled with coal-burning engines. The above figures are the
average results during the month of May, 1871, of all the trains on the
roads from whose locomotive reports it has been compiled. The following
report of experiments, which were carefully made by the writer, will
give the performance of a locomotive when great care is taken to
produce good results. It should be stated, however, that the engine
with which these experiments were made had been in service eighteen
months, without receiving thorough repairs, and that the boiler at
times primed badly, so that the rate of evaporation of water per pound
of coal is not a fair indication of the performance of the engine in
that respect. The coal used was known as Brazil coal, from Indiana, and
in order to compare the performance of two engines only lumps of coal
were used, so as to leave no room for question regarding the relative
amount of fine coal used by each engine. The maximum grades on the road
on which the experiments were made were 30 feet per mile, and the
total ascent from the lowest to the highest point on the road was 374
feet.

QUESTION 448. _How can we determine the speed at which an engine is
running?_

_Answer._ In the absence of any special instruments for the purpose, BY
COUNTING THE NUMBER OF REVOLUTIONS OF THE DRIVING-WHEELS PER MINUTE,
THEN MULTIPLYING THE LENGTH OF THEIR CIRCUMFERENCE IN INCHES BY THE
NUMBER OF THEIR REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE AND THE PRODUCT BY 60, AND
DIVIDING THE LAST PRODUCT BY 63,360. THE QUOTIENT WILL BE THE SPEED
IN MILES PER HOUR. Thus, supposing driving-wheels which are 61¹⁄₂ in.
in diameter, and whose circumference is therefore 193.2 in., should
make 164 revolutions per minute, then 193.2 × 164 × 60 ÷ 63,360 = 30,
(nearly) miles per hour.




PART XXV.

WATER-TANKS AND TURN-TABLES.


QUESTION 449. _How are locomotive tenders or tanks supplied with water?_

[Illustration: Fig. 225. Scale ¹⁄₁₆ in. = 1 foot.]

_Answer._ At suitable points, called water stations, along the line
of the road, large tanks or reservoirs are located, which are filled
either from a natural stream which is higher than the tank and thus
flows into the latter, or else the water is pumped in, either by hand
or by horse, wind, water or steam power. These tanks are usually,
when there is room for them, located near the track, as shown in fig.
225, so that the water can be conducted by a spout, _a_, direct from
the tank to the man-hole of the tender. Communication to and from
this spout is opened and closed by a valve, _b_, inside of the tank.
The spout is usually attached to the tank by a hinged joint, so that
it can be lowered to the tender and then raised up out of the way of
the engine and train. It is generally balanced by a counterweight,
suspended to one end of a rope, which passes over a pulley and is
fastened to the spout at the other end. Such tanks are now generally
made of wooden staves like a tub or pail, and supported on a heavy
frame, _c c c_, made of wood, as shown in the engraving, or on stone or
brick masonry.

[Illustration: Fig. 226. Scale ¹⁄₁₆ in. = 1 foot.]

When there is no room for the tank or reservoir near the track, it is
placed in any convenient position at some distance from it, and the
water is then conveyed by an underground pipe to the place where the
locomotive must take water. At the end of this pipe what is called a
_water-crane_, fig. 226, is located. This consists of a vertical pipe,
_A_, with a horizontal arm, _B_, which is made so as to swing around
over the man-hole of the tender when the latter is to be filled with
water. In some cases the horizontal arm alone swings around, but in
others the vertical pipe turns with the horizontal one in a joint, _C_,
underneath the surface of the ground. The latter plan is thought to be
preferable to the first, as the pipe is less liable to freeze fast in
the joint when the latter is underground than when it is exposed above.
A suitable valve, _D_, is also attached to the pipe below ground, so
that the stream of water can be turned off or on at pleasure by the
wheel _E_.

QUESTION 450. _What considerations should determine the source from
which a supply of water should be drawn?_

_Answer._ The first must of course be its convenience to the point
where the water is to be used; but more attention should be given to
the quality of the water than it ordinarily receives, as the use of
impure water, or that which contains a considerable amount of mud or
solid matter mixed with it, or in suspension as it is called, or has
lime or other mineral substances chemically combined with it, will very
soon coat the inside of the boiler with a covering of scale, which is
a very bad conductor of heat, and consequently the boiler is much less
efficient and much more heat is wasted than if the heating surfaces
were clear. Besides this loss of efficiency, when boiler plates are
covered with non-conducting scale, they are much more liable to be
injured by the action of the fire than when the water comes directly in
contact with the metal of the plates. Some water, too, has a corroding
effect on the metal of the boiler which is very destructive.

QUESTION 451. _How can the relative amount of incrustating substances
in different kinds of water be determined?_

_Answer._ The relative quantity of solid matter or mud which is held in
suspension can be at least approximately determined by simply filling
vessels, say large clear glass bottles, with different kinds of water
and letting them stand for some time until the solid matter settles to
the bottom.

An easy method of precipitating the lime and some other salts which are
held in solution and which will not settle until they are converted
into a solid form is the following: Dissolve in a goblet of pure water
(distilled or freshly caught rain water) two or three teaspoonfuls of
the _oxalate of ammonia_. Have equal quantities, say a goblet-full of
each of the waters to be tested, ranged side by side and marked so as
to be identified. Into each of these goblets stir equal quantities of
the solution mentioned--about three teaspoonfuls will be enough--and
let them stand for a day. The lime and some other salts will be
precipitated and fall to the bottom as a powder; and the quantity of
this precipitate in each glass will form a very good index of its
relative injuriousness in the formation of scale.

When the oxalate of ammonia cannot easily be procured, an experiment
may be tried, in the same way, by dissolving common white soap, or
other pure soap, in a goblet of pure water, and then stirring into the
glasses of water to be tested a few teaspoonfuls of this solution. The
comparative amount of lime in the water will be shown by the amount of
coagulated matter which will be thrown down.[104]

  [104] Correspondent of the Railroad Gazette.

QUESTION 452. _How are locomotives turned around on the track?_

_Answer._ The most common means employed for that purpose is a
_turn-table_, fig. 227. This consists of two heavy beams made of wood,
cast or wrought iron, placed side by side and resting on a pivot in the
centre, on which they turn. They are placed in a circular pit below the
level of the track, so that when rails are laid in the ordinary way on
top of the beams they will be exactly level with the track which leads
up to the pit. By turning the beams on the central pivot so that the
rails will come exactly in line with the permanent track which leads
up to the pit, the locomotive can be run on the turn-table, which is
then revolved a half-revolution, which of course reverses the position
of the locomotive and brings it opposite the permanent track so that
it can be run off from the table. In order to prevent the beams from
tipping down when the engine first runs on or off of the turn-table,
wheels are placed at their outer ends which run on a circular track
and bear any inequality of weight that may be thrown on them if the

50-FOOT TURN-TABLE, BY WILLIAM SELLERS & CO., PHILADELPHIA.]

[Illustration: Fig. 229.]

_Answer._ It usually consists of a vertical post, _A_, shown in
fig. 228, which is a transverse section through the centre of the
turn-table, the end of which rests on hard cast iron or steel bearings.
In some cases, as shown in figs. 227 and 228, which represent a
turn-table built by William Sellers & Co., of Philadelphia, the weight
rests on conical steel rollers, _m m_, which revolve in a circular
path formed in the top plates. Sometimes turn-tables are fitted with
gearing and cranks, _D_, fig. 228; but if they are made so that the
whole weight rests on the centre, and if they are of sufficient length
so that an engine and tender can be moved on them sufficiently to be
balanced over the centre, gearing will not be needed; but a simple
lever fastened to the turn-table will be all that will be required to
turn the table and the engine and tender on it. The tables should be of
such a diameter or length across the centre as will enable the class
of engine in use on any road to be balanced. With light engines the
50-feet table is large enough; with the long, heavy engine now used on
the great trunk lines, the engine and tender quite fill up the entire
length of 50 feet, leaving no margin for adjustment. In such cases, the
54 feet, 56 feet, or, better, the 60 feet, should be employed. These
large tables are also made heavier in proportion. The table should be
of such a length that engines, with tender either empty or full, when
run on the table can be so placed as to bring the centre of gravity
immediately over the centre. When so balanced, one man can turn the
loaded table with ease.

In setting up turn-tables it is necessary that the foundation at
centre, upon which the pivot rests, should be of the most substantial
character, so as not to be liable to settle. The circular track, which
may be made of light rails, say 28 or 30 lbs. to the yard, should be
level, and the table should be so adjusted as to swing clear of the
circular track when loaded. The pit required is quite shallow near the
edge and deepens towards the centre. Provision is made for covering
the entire pit by a platform turning with the table, but this should
be avoided whenever possible, as the best constructed cover does offer
some resistance in turning. Even in roundhouses, where a covered
pit might be considered preferable as presenting a smooth floor for
crossing in any direction, it has been found advisable, in view of the
greatest ease in turning and the facility offered by the open pit for
cleaning, to dispense with the cover. The centre upon which the table
turns is constructed of the best cast steel, and consists of conical
rollers of steel between two steel plates grooved out to receive these
rollers. This part of the table must be kept clean and well oiled, say
with best sperm or lard oil and tallow of such a consistency as not to
harden in cold weather. The top cap at centre is held in place by a
circle of bolts. These bolts take the entire weight of the table and
load; by slacking off the bolts the table can be lowered on the wheels
on the circular track and the cap lifted off to gain access to the
plates and rollers. These should be opened, examined and cleaned at
least once every three months.

Under the cap and between it and the top of the centre box are segments
of wood. These can be altered in thickness to bring the table in
proper adjustment. If the centre foundation settles, these segments
should be thinned sufficiently to enable the table to be screwed
up to a proper height. With proper care such tables are practically
indestructible.[105]

  [105] Wm. Sellers & Co.

QUESTION 454. _Is there any other method of turning locomotives?_

_Answer._ Yes; what is called a ~Y~ is sometimes used. This consists
of a system of tracks laid somewhat in the form of the letter ~Y~,
as shown in fig. 229, in which _A B_ is the main track, with two
curves, _A C_ and _B C_, laid as shown. If now it is desired to turn a
locomotive which is standing in the position of the dart _A_, it is run
on the curve _A C_ to the position of the darts _a_ and _C_. It is then
run backward from _C_ on the curve _C B_, as represented by the dart
_b_, and when it reaches the main track in the position of the dart _B_
it is evident that its position will be reversed, as is shown if we
compare the direction of the dart _A_ with that of _B_.




PART XXVI.

INSPECTION OF LOCOMOTIVES.


QUESTION 455. _What are the principal divisions of the work of
operating or running a locomotive?_

_Answer._ They are: 1. Inspection and lubrication; that is, an
examination of the parts to see that they are in good working order,
and the application of oil to the journals and other parts subjected to
wear. 2. Setting the engine in motion and starting the locomotive and
train. 3. Management while running. 4. Stopping the engine and train.
5. Laying up. 6. Management in case of accident. 7. Cleaning the engine.

QUESTION 456. _When the locomotive is inspected, what should be
especially observed about the boiler?_

_Answer._ In the first place, all new boilers should be tested by
pressure before being used, and ALL boilers, whether new or old,
SHOULD BE TESTED PERIODICALLY. The oftener the better. The ways of
applying the pressure test are: 1, the cold-water test, that is, by
filling the boiler with cold water and then forcing in an additional
quantity with a force-pump so as to raise the pressure to that at
which it is intended to test the boiler; 2, the warm-water test, by
filling the boiler entirely full of cold water and then kindling a
fire in the grate so as to warm this water. As water expands about
one twenty-fourth in rising from 60 to 212 degrees, the rise in
temperature will cause a corresponding increase in pressure; 3, by
steam pressure.

If the latter method were not so commonly used, it would seem the
height of madness to test a boiler--which is neither more nor less than
an attempt to explode it--in the shop where it is built or repaired,
and where the results of an explosion would be more disastrous and
fatal than anywhere else, in order to see whether it will explode when
put into service on the line of the road. The danger of explosion is
also increased at such times by hammering and caulking at leaky rivets
and joints.[106] It would seem, therefore, very much more rational
to test boilers first by hydraulic pressure. For a first test this
is preferable, because cold water will leak through crevices which
would be tight when the boiler is heated, so that leaks can be more
surely detected with cold than with warm or hot water. It is, however,
doubtless true that boilers are often strained much more by the unequal
expansion of the different parts than by the actual pressure. It is
therefore thought that after the hydraulic test has been applied the
second or warm-water test should be used. This can be easily done,
as the boiler must be filled full of water for the first test. When
the boiler is subjected to the test pressure, it should be carefully
examined to see whether any indications of weakness are revealed. Any
material change of form or any very irregular change of pressure is
indicative of weakness. The flat stayed surfaces should be carefully
examined by applying a straight edge to them before and after they
are subjected to pressure, to see whether they change their form
materially. One of the greatest dangers and most common accidents to
locomotive boilers, as has been pointed out in a previous chapter, is
the breaking of stay-bolts, to detect which, a locomotive runner and
master mechanic should exercise constant vigilance. While the pressure
is on, the outside surface of the boiler should be thoroughly examined
with slight blows of a hammer, which will often reveal a flaw in the
metal or a defect in workmanship. After the hydraulic and warm-water
tests have been applied, the boiler should be emptied, and the inside
examined carefully to see whether any of the stays and braces have
been broken or displaced by the test. After this has been done, and
not until then, should steam be generated in the boiler. In making
the latter test it would doubtless be more safe to employ a pressure
somewhat lower than that employed with the cold and warm water. There
is great diversity of opinion regarding the maximum pressure which
should be employed in testing boilers. It is doubtless true that a weak
boiler might be injured and thus made dangerous by subjecting it to
a very severe pressure, while without such a test it would have been
safe. Recent experiments have indicated, however, that in most cases
the ultimate strength of material is actually increased by subjecting
it to a strain which even _exceeds_ the elastic limit, provided such a
strain is imposed only a few times. Although no absolute rule can be
given to govern all such cases, it is thought that for the hydraulic
and warm-water tests, a pressure about 50 per cent. greater and for
the steam test 25 per cent. greater than the maximum working pressure
should be employed.

  [106] Wilson on Boiler Construction.

Before old boilers are tested, they should be very carefully examined,
both inside and outside, to see whether they are injuriously corroded.
It is to be regretted that the insides of locomotive boilers are
usually made so difficult of access that it is impossible to discover
the extent and the effects of corrosion without the most careful
examination. This is not possible without getting inside of the boiler.
Whenever this can be done, a prudent locomotive runner should use the
opportunity of inspecting the boiler of his engine himself, and not
depend upon the boiler-makers who are employed for that purpose. He
should remember that it is his life and not theirs which is exposed to
danger by any weakness or defect in the construction of the boiler of
the locomotive which he runs.

Before starting the fire in a locomotive, the fire-box should be
carefully examined to see if there are any indications of leaks, which
will often reveal cracked plates, defective stay-bolts or flues. If the
latter simply leak at the joints, they can generally be made tight by
caulking or the use of the tube expander. This is easily done when the
engine is cold, but if not attended to may be very troublesome on the
road. Leaks at other parts of the boiler should be examined, as they
may reveal dangerous fractures.

It is of the utmost importance, both for safety and for economy of
working, that boilers should be kept clean, that is, free from mud
and incrustation. In some sections of the country, especially in the
Western States, this is the greatest evil against which locomotive
runners and those having the care of locomotives must contend. The
cures which have been proposed are numberless, but that which is now
chiefly relied upon is, first, the use of the best water that can be
procured, and second, frequent and thorough washing out of the boiler.

QUESTION 457. _What sort of examination should be given to the boiler
attachments?_

_Answer._ It should be observed whether the grate-bars or drop-doors
of the grate are properly fastened, and whether the ashes have been
cleaned out of the ash-pan, and also whether the fire is clean,
that is, whether the grates are free from cinders or clinkers. The
height of water in the boiler should be observed by testing it with
the gauge-cocks and by noticing it in the glass gauge, if one of the
latter is used. It is also well to blow out the sediment and mud from
the latter before starting, and to see that the valves which admit
steam and water to the glass are open. They should, however, be opened
only a very short distance, so that only a small quantity of steam or
hot water will escape in case the glass tube should be broken. The
injector, if one is used, should be tested to see that it is in working
order, and as soon as the engine starts out of the engine house both
of the pumps should also be tested, in order to see whether they are
in good working condition. The safety-valves should be raised, so as
to be sure that they are not rusted or otherwise fastened to their
seats. There is no part of a locomotive more liable to disorder than
the steam gauge. For this reason it should be frequently tested, and
whenever there is any indication of irregularity in its action it
should be examined. As the wire netting on the smoke-stack often has
holes cut into it by the action of the sparks, it should be frequently
examined to see whether it is in good condition. It is also liable to
be “gummed up,” especially if too much oil is used in lubricating the
cylinders and valves. As soon as holes are cut into the netting there
is danger that the sparks which escape will set fire to the combustible
material near the track, and if the netting is gummed up the draft will
be obstructed and the engine will not make steam. The gummy matter can
often be removed by building a wood fire on top of the netting. In
this way the oil in the gummy matter is burned up, which leaves a dry
material which can then, at least to some extent, be beaten out of the
netting.

QUESTION 458. _How can it be known whether the pumps are working well?_

_Answer._ Their operation is indicated by the force of the stream which
escapes from the pet-cock when it is open. When the pump is in good
condition the water begins to escape promptly in a strong stream as
soon as the pump-plunger begins its inward stroke, and continues to
escape until the plunger completes its stroke. If the pump is not in
good condition, this escaping stream is weak and is apt to continue
during the outward stroke of the pump-plunger. It is difficult to tell,
however, when the engine is running slowly, whether the pump will work
well at higher speeds, and therefore a locomotive runner should always
test the condition of the pumps during the previous run.

QUESTION 459. _What should be noticed in connection with the
throttle-valve?_

_Answer._ As a failure of the throttle-valve to work may be the cause
of a most serious accident, it should be certain that it is in good
working condition, that all the bolts, pins and screws and other
accessories are in good working order. It should also be known whether
the throttle-valve is steam-tight. This can be learned by observing
whether steam escapes from the exhaust-pipes or cylinder-cocks when the
latter are open, the reverse lever in full gear, and the throttle-valve
closed. If the throttle-valve leaks, enough steam may accumulate in
the cylinder, when there is no one on the engine, to start it, and in
this way cause a serious accident. The throttle-lever should always
he fastened with a set-screw or latch of some kind when the engine is
standing still.

QUESTION 460. _In inspecting the cylinders, pistons, guides and
connecting-rods, to what points should the attention be directed?_

_Answer._ It should be known whether the piston packing is properly
set out, that is, whether it is so tight that it will not “_blow
through_,” or leak steam from one end of the cylinder to the other,
which of course will waste a great deal of steam. Of the two evils,
it is, however, better to have piston-packing too loose than too
tight, because if it is too tight, it is liable to cut or scratch
the cylinders so as to make it necessary to rebore them, and at the
same time if the packing-rings are lined with Babbitt metal, the heat
created by the intense pressure and friction will melt the metal. In
some cases the cylinders become heated to so high a temperature from
this cause that the wood-lagging with which they are covered on the
outside is burned.

The packing of the piston-rods should be steam-tight, and it should be
observed whether the rod and the pump-plunger are securely attached to
the cross-head.

The utmost care must be exercised to keep the guides well oiled. The
oil cups on the guide-rods or cross-heads, when they are placed on the
latter, must be kept clean, so that the oil will flow freely, and yet
not too rapidly, on the surfaces exposed to friction. The same thing
is true of the oil-cups on the connecting-rods. Attention should be
given to the brass bearings of the connecting-rods to see that they
are not so loose as to thump, nor keyed so tight on the crank as to be
liable to heat. The latter can be easily known by moving the stub-end
lengthwise of the journal. They should never be so tight that they
cannot be thus moved with the hand. Especial attention should be given
to seeing that all the bolts and nuts on the connecting-rods are tight.
There are no parts of a locomotive which require more careful attention
in order to keep them lubricated, and thus prevent them from heating
and being “cut,” than the bearings on the crank-pins and the slides
of the cross-head. Examination should be made to see that neither the
piston-rods, pump-plungers, guides, connecting-rods nor crank-pins are
bent or sprung.

QUESTION 461. _How can it be known whether the piston-packing is too
loose or_ “_blows through?_”

_Answer._ It can usually be noticed in the sound of the exhaust, which
can be heard very distinctly on the foot-board when the furnace door is
opened. If the packing is not tight, it produces a peculiar wheezing
sound between and after each discharge of steam. If the packing leaks,
it will also be indicated by the escape of steam from _both_ the
cylinder-cocks, if they are open, just after the crank passes the dead
point. This will usually show in which of the cylinders the packing is
too loose. The same thing will occur, however, if either or both of
the main valves leak, so that it is often hard to determine whether
the “blow” is due to a leak from the valve or from the piston. Of
course, it may sometimes happen that both leak, or that the piston on
one side and the valve on the other leak, so that often the diagnosis
of the disease, as the doctors say, is extremely difficult. Careful
observation and experience will, however, aid a locomotive runner in
detecting such defects much more than any directions which can be given
here.

QUESTION 462. _What is meant by “setting out packing,” and how should
it be done?_

_Answer._ “_Setting out packing_” is simply expanding the rings when
they get too loose. With ordinary spring packing, figs. 96 and 97,
which is now generally used, this is done by screwing up the nuts
_b_, _b_, _b_, which, as was explained in answer to Question 169,
compresses the springs _a_, _a_, _a_, and thus expands the rings _A_,
_A_. In doing this, as already stated, great care must be exercised
not to screw the nuts up too hard, and it is always better to have
the packing too loose than too tight. Care must also be taken to keep
the piston-rod in the centre of the cylinder, otherwise there will be
undue pressure and wear on the stuffing-box. After the nuts are screwed
up, the position of the piston-head should be tested with a pair of
callipers. This is done by placing one leg of the callipers against
the side of the cylinder, and setting them so that the other leg will
just touch the edge of the projection _E_, fig. 96, or the end of the
piston-rod. Then by placing the callipers above and below, and on each
side of the piston, it will appear whether it is too high or too low
or too near either side; then by loosening the nuts on one side and
tightening them on the other it can be moved to a central position.
Ordinarily this work is intrusted to persons who are employed for the
purpose. A young locomotive runner, fireman or mechanic will, however,
always do well to familiarize himself with such duties, and, if
possible, do it himself, under the direction of those who are skilled
in that kind of work.

QUESTION 463. _If the stuffing-box of the piston-rod leaks, what should
be done?_

_Answer._ If the packing in it is in good condition, it can usually be
made tight by simply screwing up the gland. In doing this, the nuts on
the bolts should not be screwed up more than is necessary to make the
packing steam-tight. Any greater pressure only increases the friction
on the piston-rod unnecessarily. In doing this, the two bolts must be
screwed up equally, otherwise the gland will be “canted,” that is,
inclined so as to “bind” or bear unequally and very hard against the
piston-rod, and thus be liable to cut or scratch it. After packing has
been in the stuffing-box a long time, it becomes very hard and compact,
and sometimes partly charred. Then either it must be removed and new
packing be put in, or, if in tolerably good condition, it can often
be made to work well by simply reversing it, that is, by putting that
which was at the bottom of the stuffing-box on top and _vice versa_.
Before packing is put into a stuffing-box, the former should always be
thoroughly oiled.

QUESTION 464. _When the slides of the cross-heads wear, how is the lost
motion taken up?_

_Answer._ When there are gibs on the cross-head, the lost motion can be
taken up by putting “_liners_” or “_shims_,” that is, thin pieces of
metal, between them and the cross-head, so that they will fill up the
space between the guide-bars. When there are no gibs, the guide-bars
must be taken down, and the blocks between them at each end must be
reduced in thickness so as to bring the bars nearer together. In doing
this, great care must be taken that the guides are accurately “in line”
with the centre line or axis of the cylinder. This work should never
be intrusted to any excepting skilled workmen, from whom those who are
inexperienced should seek instruction.

QUESTION 465. _When the brass bearings of the connecting-rods become
too loose on their journals, what should be done?_

_Answer._ They must be taken down, and the two surfaces in contact must
be filed away so as to bring them closer together. In doing this they
must be filed square with the other surfaces, otherwise they will not
bear equally on the journals when they are keyed up. Before attaching
them permanently to the rods, they should be keyed on the journal in
the strap alone, so that it can be known by trial whether they move
freely and yet are tight enough to prevent thumping on the journal.
When they are attached to the rod, it is very important, especially
with coupling or parallel-rods, that the correct length from centre
to centre of the bearings be maintained. It is much better to leave
coupling-rods loose on their journals, because, if the bearings are
keyed up tight, the rods are sure to throw an enormous strain on
the crank-pins, as the distance between the centres of the axles is
not always absolutely the same, owing to the rise and fall of the
axle-boxes in the jaws. It is therefore always best to have a little
play in the coupling-rods, and it is safe to say that much more
mischief is done by meddling with the coupling-rod brasses than by
neglecting them.

QUESTION 466. _What part of the valve gear should receive attention
when the engine is inspected?_

_Answer._ All the bolts, nuts and keys should be carefully examined
to see that they are properly fastened. The bolts and nuts in the
eccentric straps are especially liable to become loose, and as they
are between the wheels, and therefore not easy of access, are often
neglected. The oil-holes should all be seen to be clear, otherwise
it will be impossible to keep the journals well oiled. The eccentric
straps and the link blocks are very liable to be imperfectly oiled, and
when the former become dry and cut, they throw a great strain on the
eccentric-rods, which is liable to break them. When this occurs the
strap and the portion of the rod which is attached to it revolve with
the eccentric, and frequently a hole is thus knocked into the front of
the fire-box, which disables the engine. The valve gear is, with the
exception, perhaps, of the pumps and injector, the most delicate part
of the locomotive, and more liable to get out of order than any other,
and should therefore be watched with the greatest care.

QUESTION 467. _How can it be known whether the main valves of a
locomotive are tight?_

_Answer._ As already indicated, the symptoms which manifest themselves
when a valve leaks are very similar to those which appear when the
piston packing leaks. If the valve is moved to its middle position and
steam is admitted into the steam-chest, and it then escapes from both
cylinder-cocks, it is apparent that the valve is not tight. But the
valve faces of locomotives usually wear concave, because the valves are
worked most about half-stroke, so that they will often be tight when in
the centre of the face, but will leak at the ends of the full stroke.
This will become apparent by the peculiar wheezing sound, already
referred to, when the engine is at work. As has been explained, it is,
however, often very difficult to determine whether this sound is due to
a leak at the pistons or the valves. If the packing of the valve-stem
leaks, it can be remedied in the manner described for making that of
the piston-rod tight.

QUESTION 468. _To what points of the running gear should attention be
directed during inspection?_

_Answer._ All the wheels of the engine and tender should be carefully
examined to see that they are sound. A fracture in a driving-wheel is
usually apparent if the wheel is carefully examined. The condition of
ordinary cast iron tender and truck-wheels is revealed on striking them
with a hammer, when if they are sound they will give out a peculiar
clear ring; whereas if they are fractured, the sound produced by the
blow of the hammer will be dead, like that of a cracked bell. The
flanges of the wheels should also receive attention to see that they
are not broken, as such a fracture is not always revealed by the sound
produced by a blow from a hammer. The axles too should be examined
to see that the wheels have not worked loose on the wheel-seat. When
this occurs it often becomes apparent by the oil from the axle-boxes
working through between the hubs of the wheel and the axle. This can be
observed on the outside of the wheels when the bearings are inside, and
inside the wheels when the bearing is outside.

The springs should be examined to see that they are in good condition,
and the oil-holes in the boxes must be kept clear, so that the oil can
reach the bearings. The tender boxes are kept oiled by packing them
with cotton or woolen waste saturated with oil. This should be taken
out occasionally and renewed and the boxes cleaned. The working of the
driving-boxes up and down the jaws will in time wear them so that there
will be some lost motion in the jaws. This will be indicated by a thump
when the cranks pass the dead point. A similar thump will, however,
be produced by lost motion in the boxes of the main connecting-rod,
so that it is difficult to determine, without special examination,
the cause which produces the concussion. It is therefore best when
an engine works with a thump at each revolution for the runner to
stand by the side of it where he can touch the connecting-rods and
driving-wheels, and then have the fireman open the throttle-valve so as
to move the engine slowly. If the lost motion is in the connecting-rods
it can be felt by the jar as it passes the dead points. The same is
true of lost motion in the jaws, which can be felt by touching the
driving-wheels. When the jaws become worn the lost motion can be
taken up by moving up one or both of the wedges. When this is done,
great care must be taken to keep the centres of the driving-axles the
same distance apart on both sides of the engine, and also to keep
their centre lines square with the frames. There should always be
centre-punch marks placed on the frames or guide-yokes on each side of
the engine in front of the main axle, and at equal distances from its
centres, so that when the boxes or jaws become worn the position of the
axle can be adjusted with a tram from these marks. Of course, if the
main axle is square, it is easy to adjust the trailing axle from it
with a tram. If the axles are not square with the frames and parallel
with each other, the engine will run towards one side or the other of
the track, according to the inclination of the axles. It sometimes
happens that the bolts which hold up the wedges in the jaws are broken.
When this occurs the wedge drops down, and of course the box has so
much lost motion that it soon manifests itself in the working of the
engine. These bolts, and also those which hold up the clamps on the
frames at the bottom of the jaws, should be examined when the engine
is inspected, so as to be sure they are in good condition. The bolts
and nuts about both the engine and tender trucks should be watched to
see that none are lost or work loose. The engine and tender should
occasionally be lifted up from the centre plates of the truck, and the
latter be lubricated with tallow. It often happens that these become
dry, so that they are difficult to turn when the weight rests on them,
and therefore they will not adjust themselves easily to the curves of
the track.

QUESTION 469. _What other parts of a locomotive should be examined
before starting?_

_Answer._ It should be certain that the brakes on the tender are in
good working condition, that is, that the bolts, nuts and keys are
all secure, the levers, rods and chains properly connected, and the
shoes fastened and not too much worn. If either an atmospheric or
vacuum brake is used, it should be tested before starting, to see that
the pump or ejector is in good working condition. It is also well to
apply the brakes to the train before starting, so as to see whether the
connections are in good condition and properly connected. It is always
best for the locomotive runner to examine the connections of the brake
hose through the whole train himself, to be sure that they are properly
made.

The inside of the water-tank should also be examined occasionally, to
see whether it is clean, and if not it should be thoroughly washed out.
The man-hole should always be covered before starting, in order to
prevent cinders and coal from falling in, which are liable to obstruct
the pump valves. It is hardly necessary to say that it must always
be certain before starting that there is enough water in the tank to
feed the boiler until the next point is reached at which a supply can
be obtained. The sand-box must also be filled, the bell rope in good
condition, and if running at night the reflector of the head-light must
be polished and the lamp supplied with oil and the wick trimmed so
as to burn brilliantly. The locomotive runner must also see that the
proper signals are displayed in front of his engine.

QUESTION 470. _What tools, etc., should every locomotive runner on the
road carry?_

_Answer._ A coal shovel, coal pick, long-handled hoe[107] and poker,
a pair of jacks, either screw or hydraulic, chains, rope and twine to
be used in case of accident, a heavy pinch-bar for moving the engine,
a small crow-bar, oil-cans with short and long spouts and another
smaller one with spring bottom, a steel and a copper hammer, a cold and
a cape chisel, a hand-saw, axe and hatchet, one large and one small
monkey-wrench and a full assortment of solid wrenches for the bolts
and nuts of the engine, cast iron plugs for plugging tubes, with a bar
for inserting them, two sheet iron pails or buckets, different colored
lanterns and flags, according to the colors used for signals on the
line, and a box with a half-dozen torpedoes.

  [107] These are of course not needed on wood-burning engines.

QUESTION 471. _What duplicate parts should be carried with the engine?_

_Answer._ Keys, bolts and nuts for connecting-rods, split-keys, wedge
bolts, bolts for oil-cellars of driving and truck boxes, driving and
truck spring-hangers, wooden blocks for fastening guides in case of
accident, blocks for driving-boxes and links, a half-dozen ³⁄₄-in.
bolts, from six inches to two feet long, to be used in case of
accident, two extra water-gauge glasses, two glass head-light chimneys.

QUESTION 472. _What should be observed in lubricating a locomotive or
any other machinery?_

_Answer._ The most important thing to observe is that the oil reaches
the surface to be lubricated. It is of much greater importance that
the lubricant should reach the right place than that a large quantity
should be used. A few drops carefully introduced on a journal will do
much more good than a large quantity poured on the part carelessly. For
this reason all oil-cups and oil-holes should be kept clean so as to
form a free passage for the oil.




PART XXVII.

RUNNING LOCOMOTIVES.


QUESTION 473. _Before starting the fire in a locomotive, what must be
observed?_

_Answer._ It must always be noticed, before kindling the fire, whether
the boiler has the requisite quantity of water in it; that all cinders,
clinkers and ashes are removed from the grates and ash-pan; that the
grates and drop-door are properly fastened, and that the throttle-valve
is closed and the lever secured. Locomotive boilers are sometimes
seriously injured by building a fire in them when there is no water in
the boiler. In filling a boiler it must be remembered, however, that
when the water is heated it will expand, and that when bubbles of steam
are formed they will mix with the water and thus increase its volume,
so that after the water is heated its surface will be considerably
higher than when it is cold.

QUESTION 474. _How should the fire in a locomotive be started?_

_Answer._ It should be started very slowly, so as not to heat any one
part suddenly. Probably the greatest strains which a locomotive boiler
has to bear are those due to the unequal expansion and contraction of
its different parts. When the fire is started, of course the parts
exposed to it are heated first, and consequently expand before the
others. Now, if the fire is kindled rapidly, the heating surfaces
will become very hot before the heat is communicated to the parts not
exposed to the fire. Thus the tubes, for example, will be expanded so
as to be considerably longer than the outside shell of the boiler,
and therefore there will be a severe strain on the tube-plates, which
will be communicated to the fire-box, stay-bolts, braces, etc. The
inside plates of the fire-box will also become much hotter than those
on the outside, and as it is rigidly fastened to the bar to which both
the inside and the outside shells are fastened at the bottom, its
expansion will all be upward, which thus strains the stay-bolts in
that direction. As the motion due to this expansion is greatest near
the top of the fire-box, the top stay-bolts are of course strained the
most, and it is those in that position, as has already been pointed
out, which are the most liable to break. When steel plates are used the
expansion or contraction often cracks them, and sometimes, hours after
the fire is withdrawn from the fire-box, the inside plates will crack
with a report like that of a pistol. It is therefore very important
both to heat and cool a locomotive boiler very slowly, and the fire
should always be kindled several hours before the engine starts on its
run.

QUESTION 475. _What should be done when the locomotive leaves the
engine-house and before the train is started?_

_Answer._ Before leaving the engine-house the cylinder cocks should be
opened, so that all the water or steam which is condensed in warming
the cylinders can escape. Before the engine is started from the
engine-house the bell should be rung and time enough allowed for any
workmen employed about the engine to get out of the way. This rule must
be scrupulously obeyed under _all circumstances_, and a locomotive
should _never_ be started without first giving such a signal. Without
it there is always danger that some one about the engine will be
hurt or killed. While running from the engine-house to the train the
runner should observe very carefully the working of all the parts of
his engine, and as far as possible see that they are in good working
condition. The fireman should stay on the tender to handle the brake,
as may be necessary, and should assist in coupling the tender to the
first car of the train. The junction with the train, especially when
it is a passenger train, should be made very gently, as otherwise
passengers may be injured by the shock. Before starting the runner
should see _himself_ that the engine and tender are securely coupled
together, and the latter to the train, that the frictional parts are
properly lubricated, as explained heretofore, that the fire is in good
condition and that the requisite quantity of steam has been generated.
If the steam is too low, the blower is started, which stimulates the
fire.

QUESTION 476. _When the train is ready, how should the engine be
started?_

_Answer._ After the signal to start is given by the conductor, the
runner also gives a signal by either ringing the bell or blowing the
whistle. The latter should, however, be used, especially at stations,
as little as possible, on account of the risk of frightening horses
and the shock which it produces on persons who are unaccustomed to
hearing it, or are suffering from any nervous disorder. After giving
the requisite signal, the runner places the reverse-lever so that the
valve will work either in full gear or very near it. He then opens the
throttle _slowly_ and _cautiously_ so as to start the train gradually.
If the train is a very heavy one, it is best to back the engine so as
just to “take up the slack of the train,” that is, to push the cars
together so that there will be no space between them and thus compress
the car draw-springs. When the cars stand in this way, those at the
front end of the train are started one after another, which makes the
start easier than it would be if it were necessary to start them all
at once. If the throttle is opened too rapidly, the driving-wheels are
apt to slip, but with a very heavy train, even with the greatest care,
this is liable to occur. If the train can not be started otherwise, the
rails must be sanded by opening the valves in the sand-box. As little
sand should be used as possible, because the resistance of cars running
on sanded rails is greater than on clean rails, and thus the train is
more difficult to draw after it reaches the rails to which sand has
been applied. Thus the difficulty to be overcome may be increased by
the means employed to overcome it.

While the train is slowly set in motion the fireman and runner must
ascertain by watching whether the whole train moves together, and that
none of the couplings are broken in starting, and also whether any
signal is given to stop, as is sometimes necessary after the train
has started. On leaving the station he should observe whether all the
signals indicate that the track is clear and that the switches are
set right, and also look out for obstructions on the track. The train
should always be run slowly and cautiously until it has passed all the
frogs, switches and crossings of the station yard, and not until then
and when the runner has seen that everything is in order should he run
at full speed. As the engine gains in speed the reverse lever should be
thrown back and nearer the centre of the quadrant or sector, so as to
cut off “shorter.”

QUESTION 477. _After the engine is started, how can it be run most
economically?_

_Answer._ The advantage of using steam expansively has already been
explained in Part V.; it is more economical to use steam of a high
pressure which is done by keeping the throttle-valve wide open, and
then regulating the speed by cutting off shorter--that is, expanding it
more. If the speed is reduced by partly closing the throttle-valve, the
steam is wire-drawn and, as was shown in answer to Question 59, it then
produces much less useful effect than it would if it was admitted into
the cylinder at full boiler pressure.

It is found, however, that in many cases if the steam is cut off very
short the final pressure when it escapes is so low that it does not
produce blast enough to stimulate the fire, and therefore the boiler
will not make enough steam. This is more liable to occur with engines
which have small than with those which have large boilers, or when the
boilers are in bad condition or the fuel is of poor quality. When it
does occur it is necessary to work steam during a longer portion of
the stroke, so as to increase the final pressure when it is exhausted
and regulate the speed with the throttle-valve. Of course this is very
wasteful, but it is often the best which can be done and pull the train.

There is also another practical difficulty in using steam of a high
pressure and running with the throttle wide open and regulating the
speed with the reverse lever alone. The link motion, as has already
been explained, will not be effective in cutting off at a point below
about one-quarter of the stroke. Now it often happens, even when
cutting off at that short point, with light trains on a level or
slightly descending grade, that the speed will be too great if the
throttle is wide open and with full steam pressure in the boiler. When
this is the case, it is absolutely necessary to reduce the speed either
by partly closing the throttle, or reducing the pressure in the boiler.
Undoubtedly if valve-gear for locomotives was so constructed that steam
could be cut off effectively at a shorter point of the stroke, it would
result in increased economy in the use of steam.

The runner should aim to run at as nearly uniform speed as possible,
and in order to do so should divide the distance between stopping
points and the time given for running it into as small divisions as he
conveniently can, so as to be able to tell as often as possible whether
he is running too fast or too slow, and thus travel over the shorter
spaces in corresponding periods of time.

QUESTION 478. _How should the boiler be fed?_

_Answer._ The feeding of the boiler should if possible be continuous,
and the quantity of water pumped into it should be adjusted to the
amount of work which the engine is doing. Ordinarily one pump is more
than sufficient for feeding the boiler, so that usually only the one
on the right side of the engine, where the runner stands, is used.
The flow of the water is regulated by partly opening or closing the
feed-cock. The injector is commonly used only when the engine is
standing still, when the pumps will not feed. In feeding the boiler it
must be seen that the water is neither too high nor too low. If it is
too low there will be danger of overheating the crown-plates or even
of an explosion; if it is too high, the steam space in the boiler is
diminished unnecessarily, and will cause the water to rise in the form
of a spray, and thus be carried into the cylinders with the steam, or
the boiler will _prime_ or _foam_, as it is called. This water, if it
collects in the cylinder as already explained, may by the concussion
produced by the motion of the piston break the cylinder.

QUESTION 479. _What is the cause of priming in a boiler?_

_Answer_. It is often caused by the difference in temperature and
pressure in the water below and the steam above. Thus, if we have a
boiler in which the water is heated to a temperature due to 100 lbs.
effective pressure, or 338 degrees, and we then open the throttle-valve
suddenly, so as to relieve the pressure on top of the water, there
will at once be a rapid generation of steam in the water which will
rush to fill the space from which the steam has been drawn. This newly
generated steam will be formed at the hottest part of the boiler first,
that is, next to the heating surface. It will therefore happen that as
soon as the pressure is relieved, bubbles of steam from all parts of
the heating surface of the boiler will flow to the point at which the
steam escapes. The motion of these bubbles will be so rapid that large
quantities of water will be carried with them. The same thing will also
occur if the heat of the water is increased very rapidly. The water
will then become hotter than the temperature due to the pressure of the
steam above it, and consequently there will be a rapid formation and
escape of bubbles of steam from the water, which will thus have the
same effect as they would have if the steam pressure was reduced.

The amount of water carried up with the steam is increased if the
escape of the latter is obstructed in any way, owing to imperfect
circulation of water in the boiler, or by floating impurities, such
as oil, on the surface. When this condition of things exists, the
ebullition is, as it were, convulsive, and the water is thus carried up
with the steam when it escapes. Priming is also probably due in some
measure to the flow of steam over the surface of the water to the point
of outflow,[108] carrying particles of water with it just as a high
wind will, when blowing over the crests of the waves of the sea.

  [108] Wilson on Steam Boilers.

When steam is drawn, as it usually is in locomotives, from the top
of the dome to which the safety-valves are attached, the tendency to
prime is very much increased when they are blowing off, so that some
engineers advocate the use of two domes, from both of which the supply
of steam is sometimes drawn, and in other cases the safety-valves are
mounted on one, and the steam-pipe is placed in another dome. Whenever
the safety-valves begin blowing off steam, the pressure in the boiler
should be reduced as soon as possible, not only because when they are
blowing off it tends to produce priming, but because the steam which
escapes from them is wasted. The pressure can be most economically
reduced either by increasing the amount of water which is fed into the
boiler or by opening the heater cocks and allowing the steam to escape
into the tank and thus warm the water. If the boiler is too full, the
former method cannot be employed, and in heating the water in the tank
the runner must be careful not to get it too hot, because in that case
neither the pumps nor the injectors will work satisfactorily, and the
paint on the tenders is also liable to be blistered and destroyed by
the heat. By feeling the tank with the hand it can soon be discovered
whether the water is too hot. If the steam pressure cannot be reduced
in any other way, the furnace door must be partly opened.

The use of muddy water will also sometimes cause a boiler to prime. It
is probable that priming is sometimes due to the formation of foam on
the surface of the water, and therefore all priming is often called
foaming; whereas it is thought that often a boiler will prime when the
water does not foam. More accurate information regarding the priming of
boilers is, however, much needed, as many of the phenomena have thus
far not been satisfactorily explained. The principal causes of priming
in ordinary practice are, however, undoubtedly owing to defective
circulation, too little steam room, impure water, or too much water in
the boiler.

QUESTION 480. _How can it be known whether an engine is priming, and
what should be done to prevent it?_

_Answer_. The priming of a boiler can be known by the white appearance
of the steam which escapes from the smoke-stack and the cylinder
cocks. Dry steam always has a bluish color. When an engine primes
or works water into the cylinders, it is usually indicated by a
peculiar dead sound of the exhaust, which from this cause loses its
distinctly defined and sharp sound. This can be observed best when the
furnace door is opened. It is also indicated by the discharge from the
gauge-cock, as the water which then escapes from the lower cocks is
mixed with steam, or, as runners say, is not “solid,” and the steam
from the upper cocks is not clear, but mixed with water. To use a
phrase employed by practical men, the priming or foaming of the boiler
may be known by the “flutter” of the gauge-cocks. As soon as there are
any indications of priming, foaming, or that water is working into the
cylinders, the cylinder cocks should be opened at once, otherwise the
cylinders, cylinder heads or pistons may be broken. The throttle-valve
should be either partly or entirely closed. When the latter is done
the foaming will in most cases cease for the time, so that the runner
can tell how much solid water there is in the boiler. If he finds that
the boiler has too much water in it? it is best to shut off the pumps,
and in many cases the blow-off cock is opened. The latter is, however,
attended with some danger, because if any obstruction should get into
the blow-off cock, or it should stick fast, so that it could not be
closed, all the water would escape from the boiler, and with a heavy
fire in the fire-box there would be great danger of overheating, and
thus injuring the boiler or of “burning” it, as it is ordinarily termed.

A much better method of affording relief in such cases is to place
what is called a _surface-cock_ in the back end of the fire-box, about
half way between the upper and lower gauge-cocks. With such a cock,
the water can be blown off from the surface instead of from the
bottom. As foaming or priming is often caused by oil, or other floating
impurities on the surface, they can be blown out of the boiler with
this arrangement, whereas, if the water escapes from the bottom of the
boiler, the floating impurities will always remain after it is blown
off. A perforated pipe, which extends for some distance along the
surface of the water inside the boiler, is sometimes attached to the
surface-cock, so that the water which is blown off will be drawn from a
number of points along the surface.

If the steam is rising rapidly when foaming begins, it will be well to
cool the boiler off by opening the furnace door part way. This means of
relief should, however, be used as little as possible, because there
is always danger of causing the tubes or other parts of the boiler to
leak, by either heating or cooling suddenly or rapidly. If the engine
primes when there is but little water in the boiler, and at a time when
the steam is rising rapidly, it may sometimes be remedied by increasing
the amount of feed-water, and thus partly cooling the water inside.
The use of pure water, careful firing so as to keep the steam pressure
regular, feeding the boiler so that the level of the water will be
nearly uniform, and then starting the engine carefully, that is,
opening the throttle-valve gradually, are the most effective means in
practice of preventing a locomotive boiler from priming.

QUESTION 481. _What is the economical effect of priming on the
consumption of fuel in locomotives?_

_Answer._ It causes a great waste of heat, first by the escape of that
contained in the hot water which passes through the cylinders and which
does no work, and second, when steam is mixed with a great deal of
water, it will not flow either to or from the cylinders as quickly or
easily as dry steam will. Consequently the initial pressure on the
piston, if the engine is running even moderately fast, and is cutting
off short, will not be so great as it would be if dry steam was used.
Wet steam is also more difficult to exhaust from the cylinder than that
which is dry, and therefore the back pressure on the piston is greater
when the boiler primes than when dry steam alone is used.

QUESTION 482. _When running on the open road, what should the
locomotive runner observe?_

_Answer._ Either he or the fireman should _constantly_ watch the track
in front of them, and also observe, from time to time, whether the
train of cars, especially if it is a long one which he is handling,
is in good condition. HE MUST OBSERVE EVERY SIGNAL SCRUPULOUSLY, AND
SHOULD NEVER PASS ONE UNTIL HE IS SURE THAT HE IS AUTHORIZED TO DO
SO. The well-known maxim, “be sure you are right; then go ahead,”
should be changed for locomotive runners to, DON’T GO AHEAD UNTIL
YOU ARE SURE YOU ARE RIGHT, AND WHEN IN DOUBT ALWAYS CHOOSE THE SIDE
OF SAFETY. In running through curves, the speed of the train should
always be moderated in proportion to the sharpness of the curve, and
before reaching it. In running through curves, the tendency of the
train is to continue in a straight line, and there is thus danger of
running off the track. The higher the speed, of course, the greater
is the resistance which is required to prevent the train from running
in a straight line, and consequently the greater is the strain which
is thrown on the flanges of the wheels and on the rails and axles.
In running through curves, it is also impossible, usually, to see
further than a short distance ahead, and therefore, if the train is
running very fast, it cannot be stopped in time, should there be any
obstruction or danger on the track.

QUESTION 483. _What precautions should be observed in running over
steep grades?_

_Answer._ On approaching an ascending grade the runner should see
that the fire is in good condition, and as much coal should be put on
it as can be burned to advantage. He should also fill the boiler as
full of water as he safely can, without danger of priming, and should
heat this water as hot as possible without blowing off steam at the
safety-valves. The object of this is to have a supply of water already
heated before reaching the grade. If, as often happens with a heavy
train, the boiler will not make as much steam as the engine consumes,
if there is a large supply of hot water in the boiler it can be used as
a reserve, should it be necessary to do so, without danger of injury to
the boiler. If there was so little water in the boiler that it would be
dangerous to allow it to get lower, then it would be necessary to feed
cold water as rapidly as the hot water escaped in the form of steam. It
is often impossible to heat all this cold water as fast as it is pumped
into the boiler, without reducing the steam pressure until there is
then not sufficient power to pull the train. If, however, there is a
supply of hot water in the boiler, at the critical point on the grade,
where the engine is most liable to fail, the pump can be partly shut
off, and thus less water will be pumped into the boiler, and the steam
pressure be maintained without danger. Undoubtedly it is better to
feed locomotive boilers uniformly, if that is possible, but it often
happens that a reserve supply of hot water in the boiler enables an
engine to pull a train up the most difficult place, whereas, without
such a supply, the locomotive would stick fast. As the capacity of
locomotives is rated on nearly all roads by the number of cars they can
“pull up the hill,” of course whatever aids them at the critical point
increases their capacity. It is this fact which gives engines with
large boilers so much advantage over those with small ones.

In running up steep grades, allowance should always be made for the
effect of the inclination of the track upon the position of the
water surface in the boiler, and also the fact that as soon as the
throttle-valve is closed, and steam shut off, the surface of the water
will be considerably lower than when the engine was working hard. On a
grade of 50 feet to a mile, the front end of the tubes of an ordinary
locomotive would be about 1³⁄₄ inches higher than the back end of the
crown-sheet. If, then, on working hard up such a grade, it is succeeded
by another of equal descent, the front ends of the tubes would be 1³⁄₄
inches _lower_ than they were while coming up, so that if the back end
of the crown-sheet was covered with 1³⁄₄ inches of water just before
reaching the top, it would be exposed to the fire as soon as the engine
reached the descent. This exposure would be dangerous, because not
only would the water be 1³⁄₄ inches lower over the crown-sheet, but it
would fall considerably more when the throttle-valve was closed. These
considerations will show the danger of running the water too low while
ascending steep grades.

In pulling trains up steep grades, especial caution should be exercised
to prevent any of the cars from breaking loose from the train, because
such an accident may cause great disaster.

As soon as the engine reaches the top of the grade, the fireman
should oil the main valves, because it can only be done when steam
is shut off, as the oil will not run into the steam-chest when there
is a pressure of steam in it; and as the valves are always subjected
to the severest wear while pulling up a steep grade, the valves and
valve-faces are apt to become dry. As saturated steam to some extent
prevents valves from cutting, it is not so important that they be
lubricated while the engine is working with steam, but as soon as steam
is shut off they should be oiled, otherwise there is danger of their
being injured by their friction on the valve-seats.

In running down grades, the runner has the greatest possible cause
for using every precaution, because not only is the train much more
difficult to control, but usually frequent sharp curves prevent a view
of the track for any considerable distance ahead. He should, therefore,
watch the track in front of him with the greatest vigilance, so as
to be ready to give the requisite signals to the brakemen to apply
the brakes, or, if the engine and train are provided with continuous
brakes, to apply the latter, or even reverse his engine, in case of
danger.

QUESTION 484. _How should an engine be run past those stations where
the train does not stop?_

_Answer._ The speed of the train should be slackened in passing
stations, especially if a clear view of the track and switch signals
can not be obtained at some distance before reaching the station.
There is always a possibility that the switches may be turned wrong,
or that there may be some obstruction on the track at stations, so
that some caution should be exercised in running past them. The proper
signal, either by the whistle[109] or the bell, should be given on
approaching stations, and also at all common road crossings.

  [109] The methods of giving signals vary so much on different roads
  that no general direction that will suit all cases can be given.

QUESTION 485. _What must be done on approaching a draw-bridge or a
crossing of another railroad at the same level?_

_Answer._ In many of the States it is provided by law that all trains
must come to a _dead stop_ before crossing a draw-bridge or another
railroad at the same level. Whether such a law exists or not, the rule
should always be observed. After coming to a stop, the train should
under no circumstances be started until the signal has been given to
start the train by the signal-man at the bridge or crossing. A runner
should _never assume_ that the signal has been given, nor take another
person’s word for it, but should see and know it himself. In some
conditions of the weather and with the light falling on a signal in
certain directions, it is sometimes difficult to determine its color
or form. If there is any doubt about it, the testimony of another
person should always be sought. There is good reason for believing
that color-blindness, that is, an incapacity for distinguishing one
color from another, is a much more common infirmity than is usually
supposed. It is certain, too, that people who ordinarily distinguish
colors very accurately are subject to color-blindness in certain
conditions of health, and that it is sometimes the result of overwork
or great weariness; and a case is recorded of a person who was always
color-blind after a debauch. There are, therefore, good reasons why a
locomotive runner should not always place too implicit confidence in
what he “sees with his own eyes,” but if he has any doubt, he should
take the “benefit of the doubt,” which should always lead him to take
the side of safety.

QUESTION 486. _How should the engine and train be managed in running
into a station?_

_Answer._ First of all when running into a station when the train
stops, the speed must be checked so that the train will not enter with
very great momentum. Therefore, at a distance varying from one to
three-quarters of a mile, according to the nature of the grades and
track, the steam should be shut off, so that the speed will be reduced
so much that the train under any circumstances will be under full
control. It is always better to enter a station at too low a speed than
to run in too fast, because if it is necessary, more steam can always
be admitted to the cylinders to increase the speed before coming to a
stop; whereas it is not so easy to stop the train if it is running too
fast, and it becomes necessary to check it before entering the station.
This will sometimes be necessary, because it may readily happen through
negligence or accident at stations that in switching cars one or more
may be left standing wholly or partly on the track, which the arriving
train must run over, in which case a collision with its terrible
consequences may be unavoidable.

When a train is equipped with continuous brakes, the control which
they usually give to a locomotive runner over the train is so great
that he is apt to approach stations, crossings or draw-bridges at a
high rate of speed, and rely on such brakes to stop the train. This
practice is always attended with great danger, because if it was found,
on getting near to the station, crossing or draw-bridge, that the track
was not clear, and that it was obstructed by a car or train, or the
draw was open, if the runner should attempt to apply the brakes and
from some cause they should fail to work, as sometimes occurs, then
a collision or other disaster would be inevitable, because it would
be impossible to stop the train with the ordinary hand brakes. For
this reason a locomotive runner should always approach such places
cautiously and with his train under sufficient control, so that if he
finds there is danger ahead he can stop the train with the ordinary
means, or at the worst by reversing the engine. Continuous brakes
should always, excepting in cases of imminent danger, be applied
gradually, so as not to check the cars with a jerk or too suddenly. The
practice of opening the cock which admits air to atmospheric brakes
suddenly, and then turning it back again as quickly, is almost sure to
produce disagreeable and dangerous shocks to the cars. The cock should
be opened gradually, so as to check the cars slowly at first.

QUESTION 487. _What must be attended to when running a locomotive at
night?_

_Answer._ As soon as it begins to grow dark, the head-light must be
lighted and properly trimmed, and the proper lamp signals placed in
front of the engine, if the rules of the road require the display of
such signals. A lamp should always be placed in the cab, so as to
throw its light on the steam-gauge, but not into the runner’s face,
because he is unable to see distant signals so well if his eyes are
exposed to the glare of a light near him.

At night, as objects which are passed can not be seen distinctly, it
is more difficult to tell the speed at which an engine is running than
it is in the day time. A runner should therefore consult his watch
frequently, and by counting the revolutions of the wheels, which he can
do by the sound of the pump valve or other part of the machinery, he
can tell from the rule given in the answer to Question 438 the speed at
which the locomotive is running. From this rule a table can easily be
constructed for an engine with any size of driving-wheels, showing the
speed for any given number of revolutions per minute. It will be a good
exercise for a young locomotive runner to construct such a table, which
will be found very convenient for reference if placed in a conspicuous
place in the cab.

QUESTION 488. _What must be attended to in very cold weather?_

_Answer._ Great care must be exercised to prevent the water in the
pumps, pipes and in the tender from freezing. If it does it will be
almost certain to break the pump or burst the pipes. To avoid this
the heater cocks must be opened so as to keep the water in the tender
warm. In excessively cold weather the engine should be run with greater
caution than at other times, as iron is then more brittle, and also
more liable to break, owing to the frozen condition and consequent
solidity of the track.

QUESTION 489. _In running a locomotive in severe snow or rain-storms,
what should be observed?_

_Answer._ Whenever it snows the pilot or cow catcher should be covered
with boards, or, better still, with sheet iron, so as to act like a
snow plow. Brooms made of steel wire should be placed in front of the
front wheels of the engine, so as to sweep the snow from the rails. The
front damper on the ash-pan should be kept closed so as to exclude the
snow from the ash-pan, which would soon fill it up, and in this way
obstruct the draft. If the fall of snow is very heavy or it blows into
drifts, the train must of necessity run very slowly, and even if a part
of the track is clear of snow, it is unsafe to run fast on it, as there
would be danger of throwing the engine off the rails if it should run
into a heavy drift at a high speed.

In severe rain storms bridges, culverts and such portions of the track
as are liable to be washed away should be approached cautiously,
especially at night. In both snow and rain-storms, and also in fogs,
great caution is required, owing to the difficulty of seeing signals.

QUESTION 490. _What is meant by a reserve engine or_ “_helper?_”

_Answer._ A _reserve engine_ is a locomotive which is not employed in
hauling a regular train, but is kept as a “reserve” to go to the help
of an engine which may be compelled to stop on account of an accident
of any kind, or to assist engines in moving trains up heavy grades, or
is used in clearing away a wrecked train, rebuilding bridges or other
structures.

QUESTION 491. _What must be observed in running a reserve engine?_

_Answer._ As no special arrangements are usually made in preparing
time-tables[110] for the running of reserve, or as they are usually
called by railroad men, “_wild_” engines, it may very probably happen
that it will be called upon to assist other engines when the road is
not clear, and therefore its runner must constantly be on the look-out
for signals to stop, which are often given suddenly. He must switch
off with special caution in order to be sure to keep out of the way of
regular trains running in the opposite direction on the same track.
When he reaches the train or place where the assistance of the reserve
engine is needed, he must approach it _slowly_ and _carefully_, in
order to avoid a violent shock. On the return from the assisted train,
he incurs the same danger, and must pay close attention to any signal
to stop made to him by any opposite train on the same track, and also
on his part warn such trains by the proper signals.

  [110] A _time-table_ is a table which gives the time when each train
  shall arrive at the stations it passes, the stations at which it
  shall stop, and all the regulations by which it shall be run.

When a train is run with two engines, both in front of it, the forward
one always takes the management of the train. The runner of the hind
engine must be guided by the signals of the runner of the forward
engine. In starting, the forward engine must be set in motion first
and then the one behind it. In stopping, the steam must be shut off
first in the hind engine. Likewise in decreasing the speed during the
trip, the hind engine must first regulate the flow of steam. If these
precautions are not observed the forward engine may easily be thrown
from the track by the faster motion of the hind one.

When a train is assisted by a “helper” placed _behind_ the train, and
therefore pushing it, the forward engine must likewise be set in motion
first, and steam should be let on in the hind engine only after a
signal has been given by the runner of the head engine. During the run
both engines must move with the same speed.[111]

QUESTION 492. _How should switching engines be managed?_

_Answer._ In pushing and switching the freight cars in the
station-yard, they should be moved carefully and severe shocks must
be avoided, as the cars, the goods with which they are loaded and the
persons employed about them may be injured by violent concussions. The
runner must also follow the instructions of his superior _strictly_ and
_cheerfully_, and should examine patiently and observe with discretion
the suggestions of employes who are not his superiors.

In this service it is also of special importance that the runner give a
_distinct_ signal with the whistle or bell before every movement of his
engine, in order to warn in time those who at such times often stand on
the track in the way of the engine or cars, or the persons engaged in
loading, cleaning or repairing the cars, and thus give them time to get
out of the way.[112]

QUESTION 493. _In firing a locomotive, what are the most important ends
to be attained?_

_Answer._ That which is of first and chief importance is to make
steam enough, so that the locomotive can pull its train and “_make
time_”[113]; second, it must make the requisite quantity of steam with
the least consumption of coal, and third, with the least production of
smoke, although the latter, independent of the economy of combustion,
is considered of importance only with passenger trains. What is
frequently lost sight of in considering this subject is the fact that
with all locomotives it often happens that it is a matter of extreme
difficulty to make enough steam to do the work required of the engines.
When a freight train is struggling up a grade with a heavy train, or
an express engine is obliged to make time under similar conditions,
it often depends entirely upon the quantity of steam which can be
generated in the boiler in a given time whether the engine will fail
or not. In firing, therefore, the most important end to be aimed at is
often simply to produce the largest amount of steam possible in a given
time, even at the sacrifice of economy or by producing any quantity
of smoke. Any means of economizing fuel or of smoke prevention, which
reduces the steam-producing capacity of boilers, is therefore quite
sure to be abandoned in time.

  [113] The term _make time_ means to run at the speed indicated on the
  time-table.

QUESTION 494. _How can a boiler be made to produce the largest quantity
of steam in a given time?_

_Answer._ By burning the greatest quantity of fuel possible on the
grate in that time. This can be done by keeping the grates free
from clinkers and the ash-pan from ashes, and then distributing the
coal evenly over the grates in a layer six to twelve inches thick.
The thickness of the layer which will give the best results will,
however, vary with the quality of the fuel, and must be determined by
experience. If the layer is too thick, not enough air will pass through
it to burn the coal. If it is too thin, then so much air will pass
through that the temperature in the fire will be reduced. The rapidity
of combustion will also be promoted by breaking up the coal into lumps
the size of a man’s fist or smaller. If fine coal is used it should be
wet, otherwise it will be carried into the flues by the blast before it
is burned or caked or even reaches the grate. Experience will indicate
the amount of air which can advantageously be admitted above the fire
in order to secure the maximum production of steam. The best size of
the exhaust nozzles and the position of the petticoat pipe must also be
determined by experience. It will usually be found, however, that if
enough air is admitted above the fire to prevent smoke, it will reduce
the maximum amount of steam which can be generated in a given time.
The fire should also be fed regularly and with comparatively small
quantities of fuel at a time, although if the feeding is too frequent
there is more loss from the cooling effect which results from the
frequent opening of the furnace door than is gained from the regularity
of the firing. In this, too, a fireman must consult experience to guide
him.

QUESTION 495. _How can a locomotive be fired with the least consumption
of coal?_

_Answer._ Two systems of firing are practiced in this country, one
known as the “banking system” and the other the “spreading system.”
When the banking system is employed, the coal is piled up at the back
part of the fire-box, as shown in fig. 218, and slopes down towards
the front of the grate, where the layer of coal is comparatively thin
and in an active state of incandescence. The heap of coal behind is
gradually coked by the heat in the fire-box and the gases are thus
expelled. Openings in the furnace door admit air which mingles with
the escaping gases, which then pass over the bright fire in front,
and are thus supposed to be consumed. When the “bank” of coal behind
becomes thoroughly coked, it is pushed forward on the bright fire and
fresh coal is again put on behind to be coked. This system of firing is
practiced on some roads with good results, but it is doubtful whether
it could be used successfully with coal which cakes and clinkers badly.

The spreading system is most commonly employed in the Western States,
where the coal contains a great deal of clinker. When this is
practiced, the coal is spread evenly over the whole of the grate in a
thin layer, and its success and economy depend upon the regularity and
evenness with which this layer of coal is maintained and the fire fed.
The thickness of the coal must be adapted to the working of the engine.
When it is working lightly, the layer of coal should be thin, but when
the engine is pulling hard the layer of coal must be thicker, otherwise
the violent blast may lift the coal off the grates. The success of
this system, as was explained in answer to Question 388, depends
upon the manner in which the thickness of the fire is regulated, on
the admission of the proper amount of air above the fire, and on the
frequency with which the fire is supplied with coal. When this system
of firing is employed not more than two shovels-full of coal should
be put into the fire-box at once, and if the engine is not working
hard, one or even less will be sufficient. The firemen must, however,
determine by experience the thickness of fire, amount of air which
should be admitted and the frequency of firing which will give the best
results in practice. Doubtless these will vary with different kinds of
fuel and the construction of engines. Usually the greatest obstacle in
the way of producing good results is the fact that firemen would rather
“take things easy” than exercise that diligence and observation which
will alone insure success in any occupation.

QUESTION 496. _How can smoke be most effectually prevented?_

_Answer._ The means of preventing smoke were very fully explained in
answer to Questions 379 and 388. It may be said briefly that this can
be done only by properly regulating the supply of air which is admitted
to the fire. The means of doing this have already been explained.

QUESTION 497. _What method of firing is employed when anthracite coal
is used?_

_Answer._ The spreading system alone is then used.

QUESTION 498. _How may the rules which firemen should observe when
bituminous coal is used be briefly stated?_

_Answer._ 1. Keep the grate, ash-pan and tubes clean. 2. Break the coal
into small lumps. 3. Fire often and in small quantities. 4. Keep the
furnace door open as little as possible. 5. Consult the steam gauge
frequently, and maintain a uniform steam pressure, and if necessary to
reduce the pressure do it by closing the ash-pan dampers rather than by
opening the furnace door.

QUESTION 499. _On arriving at a station where a train stops longer than
a few minutes, what should the locomotive runner and fireman attend
to?_

_Answer._ The runner should examine thoroughly all the parts of his
engine, as has been heretofore explained. He should especially examine
all the journals and wearing surfaces to see whether they are hot.
This he can discover by feeling them. If any of them have become very
much heated, they must be cooled by throwing cold water on them, and
then thoroughly oiled. In oiling a hot journal mineral oil should
never be used, as it is easily evaporated by the heat and then takes
fire. Animal oil should therefore always be used on a hot bearing. The
working parts should be thoroughly lubricated, as already explained.

The fireman should examine the tank and see whether it is necessary
to take in a fresh supply of water. He should then examine the grates
and ash-pan, and clean the cinders and clinkers from the former, and
the ashes from the latter. Neglecting to clean the ash-pan may result
in melting and destroying the grate-bars, and by obstructing the
admission of air to the grates the ashes prevent the combustion from
being as complete as it would be otherwise. With some kinds of fuel it
is necessary to clean the tubes frequently, which must often be done at
stations where the train stops.

During the stop, as thorough an inspection of the engine should be made
by the runner and fireman as the time will permit; but any unnecessary
waste of time must be avoided, and the firing should be so managed
that nothing need be done about it during the halt at the station. On
starting again the same precautions should be exercised as on making
the first start.

QUESTION 500. _After reaching the end of its run, how should an engine
be cleaned and repaired?_

_Answer._ Before reaching the last station the firing should be so
managed that there will be as little fire as possible remaining in the
fire-box at the end of the run. After the arrival the engine should be
run over a pit which is usually provided for the purpose, and the fire
should be raked out of the fire-box by dropping the drop-door if there
is one to the grate, or turning the grate-bars edgewise, or withdrawing
one or more of them if it is necessary to do so. In this way the fire
will fall into the ash-pan, from which it can easily be raked. After
all the fire is withdrawn the dampers and furnace door should be closed
so as not to allow the cold air to cool the fire-box and tubes too
rapidly.

In order to keep the boiler clean, that is as free as possible
from sand, sediment or incrustation, it is necessary to blow it
out frequently if the water which is used contains much solid or
incrustating matter. With “bad water” the boiler should be blown out
as often as possible. On some roads this is done after each trip. In
blowing a boiler out, the blow-off cocks must be left open, and after
all the water has escaped the engine should be left to stand until it
is cooled off. If there is any considerable accumulation of mud or
sediment the hand-holes at the bottom of the fire-box and the cover to
the mud-drum should be taken off, and as much of the mud removed as
can be scraped out through those apertures. A hose pipe attached to
the hose of a force pump should then be inserted through these same
openings, and a strong stream of water forced into the boiler. By this
means much of the loose mud and scale will be washed out. The oftener
this is repeated of course the cleaner can a boiler be kept. If a
large amount of incrustation or mud has accumulated about the tubes,
some or all of them must be taken out, so as to be able to remove the
dirt.

After an engine is blown out, under no circumstances excepting
absolute necessity should it be filled with cold water until it is
entirely cooled off. It should be remembered that any sudden change of
temperature in a boiler subjects it to very great strains and incurs
the danger of cracking the fire-box plates, or causing the tubes to
leak.

The tender should also be cleaned of the mud which settles in it from
time to time, but it is not necessary to do this as often as it is to
clean the boiler. All the plates and flues should have the soot which
sticks to them thoroughly cleaned off.

Although the cleaning of the boiler and the grates is usually committed
to a special set of men, yet the locomotive runner should examine them
personally to see that it is properly done. He should pay attention to
the condition of the grate, and see whether it is level and smooth. As
soon as one or more of the bars are bent crooked, they usually burn
out. If one of the bars is burnt out the fire falls through the hole
that it leaves into the ash-pan, and then the fire under the grate will
heat it red hot, and finally may melt every bar. Every grate-bar which
is only a little damaged or bent must therefore be removed as quickly
as possible and replaced with a new one.

As soon as the engine is run into the engine-house, all superfluous
grease which has escaped from the wearing surfaces and the dust or mud
which adheres to the engine should be wiped off with cotton waste or
rags. This is usually done by men employed for the purpose. While they
are doing this, they should examine every part thoroughly and observe
whether it is in good condition, and if any defects are found they
should be reported to the proper person whose business it is to have
them repaired. As the faithfulness and skill of a fireman are often
estimated by the good or bad condition of his engine, he should, if for
no other reason, take pains to keep it clean and everything in as good
condition as possible.

If the engine is taken to pieces in order to be thoroughly repaired,
the runner, if he does not help to do this, should watch carefully the
taking it apart and the putting it together again, as in this way he
can become thoroughly familiar with the construction of the machine he
runs.

QUESTION 501. _What precaution must be taken to prevent the water in a
locomotive from freezing, if it is laid up?_

_Answer._ In very cold weather, if engines are laid up for any
considerable time, no water must be left in the tender, boiler or any
of the pipes. If, however, the engine must be soon used, and it is
impracticable to let the water out of the boiler and tender, then, if
exposed to the cold, a light fire must be kept in the boiler sufficient
to make steam enough to warm the water in the tender. The water should,
however, be drawn out of the pumps and the feed and supply pipes. This
can be done by opening the pet-cocks, and closing the tender valves and
uncoupling the hose, which will allow the water in the supply pipes to
run out. By running the engine a few revolutions the pumps will then be
emptied. The pipes and the pumps can also be prevented from freezing
without uncoupling the hose if the tender valves are closed and the
pet-cocks opened, and steam is then admitted into the supply pipes
by the heater-cocks. This forces part of the water which is in the
pumps out of the pet-cocks and warms the rest. This, however, requires
constant watchfulness to prevent freezing, and in excessively cold
weather, if the engine must lay up for any considerable time, it is
always best to empty the pumps and pipes.




PART XXVIII.

ACCIDENTS TO LOCOMOTIVES.


QUESTION 502. _What are the most serious accidents which may happen in
running a locomotive?_

_Answer._ The most serious accidents are:

1. Collision of two trains approaching each other.

2. Collision of a moving with a standing train.

3. Collision of trains at the crossing of two railroads.

4. Running a train into the opening left by an open draw-bridge.

5. Escape of an engine without any one on it.

6. Running off the track.

7. Explosion of the boiler.

8. Bursting or rather collapse of a flue.

9. Blowing out of a bolt, stud or rivet from the boiler.

10. Failure of the feed-pumps, injector or check-valve.

11. Breaking or bursting of a cylinder, cylinder-head, steam-chest, or
steam-pipe.

12. Breaking or getting loose of the piston or cross-head or bending of
the piston-rod.

13. Breaking or bending of a connecting-rod or crank-pin.

14. Breaking of a tire, wheel or axle.

15. Breaking of a spring, spring-hanger or equalizer.

16. Breaking of a frame.

17. Breaking or getting loose of a part of the valve-gear.

18. Failure of the throttle-valve.

19. Breaking of a coupling.

QUESTION 503. _What should be done to prevent a collision when two
trains are approaching each other?_

_Answer._ The obvious thing to do is to stop the trains as soon as
possible. This is done by applying the brakes at once with all their
power, and then reversing the engine, although it is best not to do
the latter until the train is somewhat checked, as there is always
danger of bursting the cylinder or breaking the cylinder-heads, piston
or connections if an engine is reversed suddenly at a high speed. Of
course the higher the speed, the greater is the danger of injury from
this cause, and therefore it is best, if there is time, first to check
the speed of the train before reversing the engine. When the engine
is reversed, the sand-valves should be opened so as to increase the
adhesion of the wheels, so that when their motion is reversed they may
check the speed of the train as soon as possible. On perceiving danger
ahead the order of procedure should be as follows:

1. Shut the throttle-valve.

2. If the train is equipped with hand brakes alone, blow the danger
signal for their application, or if the train has a continuous brake,
apply it with its full force.

3. Reverse the engine and open the throttle and the sand valves.

4. If a collision is inevitable, shut the throttle-valve before the
engines meet, because if it is left open, after the collision and when
the speed of the train is checked, the engine, if not disabled, will by
its own power crush through the wreck and thus do additional damage.

QUESTION 504. _What should be done if a standing train should see
another train approach it and there should be danger of a collision?_

_Answer._ The locomotive runner of the standing train should start his
engine in the same direction as the approaching train is running, as
quickly as possible, because the shock of the collision will be very
much lessened if both trains are moving in the same direction compared
with what it would be if one was standing still.

QUESTION 505. _What should be done to avoid a collision at a railroad
crossing?_

_Answer._ As was explained in answer to Question 485, trains should
always come to a dead stop before crossing another railroad on the same
level. If, however, through any means danger of such a collision should
be incurred, then evidently the one train should be stopped and the
other moved out of the way as soon as possible.

QUESTION 506. _How can an accident by running into the opening at a
draw-bridge be avoided?_

_Answer._ First by ALWAYS coming to a dead stop before reaching it,
and second by not starting again until it is absolutely certain that
the draw is closed. Of course if a locomotive runner of an approaching
train finds a draw open, the only thing he can do is to stop as soon as
possible.

QUESTION 507. _What measures should be taken to prevent locomotives
from escaping without a responsible person on them?_

_Answer._ In the first place when a locomotive is left standing
the throttle-valve should always be _closed_ and _fastened_, the
cylinder cocks should also be opened so that if any steam leaks into
the cylinders it will not accumulate there, but will escape, and the
reverse lever should be placed in the centre of the sector, so that if
by any accident the throttle should be opened the engine will not start.

QUESTION 508. _If a locomotive should escape, what should be done, and
how may it be captured?_

_Answer._ The first thing to be done is to telegraph to the stations
towards which the escaped engine is running, either to keep the track
clear, or, if there is a train approaching, to open a switch and thus
let the engine run off the track. An escaped engine may be captured by
a swifter engine following it, but this is always attended with great
danger, as the first engine may leave the track or become wrecked. A
safer plan is to telegraph ahead of the escaped engine and have an
engine placed in a position where the track can be seen for a long
distance in the direction in which the runaway is expected. As soon
as the latter comes in sight, the waiting engine should start in the
same direction, so that when they get near to each other they will
both be running in the same direction and at nearly the same speed.
By regulating the speed of the front engine, the following one may be
allowed to come up to it quite gently, and then a man can easily climb
from the one engine to the other, and thus both be stopped.

QUESTION 509. _What should be done in case an engine gets off the
track?_

_Answer._ The first thing to do is to close the throttle-valve and
“signal for brakes,”[114] or apply the continuous brakes if the train
is equipped with them, and then reverse the engine. If its position
after it stops is much inclined, it is generally necessary to draw the
fire to prevent injury to the heating-surface, a part of which is then
usually exposed to the steam, and therefore not covered with water.

  [114] This expression means, among railroad men, to signal to
  brakemen by blowing the whistle to have them apply the brakes.

QUESTION 510. _How is a locomotive replaced on the track in case it
gets off?_

_Answer._ It is impossible to give any directions for replacing
locomotives on the track which will meet the great variety of
circumstances which occur in practice. If the engine has not run far
from the rails, it can usually be run on again by placing blocks
of wood under the wheels and thus running them up to their proper
position, but if the engine falls on its side or runs down an
embankment, it is usually necessary to send for the appliances which
are now provided on nearly all roads for removing wrecks and replacing
engines on the track. These appliances are generally stored in what is
called a wrecking or tool car, which is placed at a convenient point
on the road, from which it can be sent to any place where its services
are likely to be needed. Such cars are generally provided with ropes,
jack-screws, chains, crowbars, levers, etc., to be used in such cases,
and generally a special set of men is sent with the wrecking car to
direct and assist in replacing engines and cars on the track. It would
lead us too far to describe all the methods of doing this employed
under various circumstances; and as such work seldom forms part of the
duties of a locomotive runner, a complete description would be out of
place here.

QUESTION 511. _After an accident which disables the engine, what is the
first thing to do?_

_Answer._ The first thing to do is always to “_protect the train_;”
that is, to send out signal men in each direction to stop approaching
trains; otherwise they might run into the wrecked train, and thus cause
a double accident.

QUESTION 512. _What is the chief cause of boiler explosions?_

_Answer._ The cause of all boiler explosions, as happily expressed by
a prominent American engineer,[115] is THAT THE PRESSURE INSIDE THE
BOILER IS GREATER THAN THE STRENGTH OF THE MATERIAL OUTSIDE TO RESIST
THAT PRESSURE. This may occur in two ways: first, and most frequently
with locomotives, from insufficient strength of the boiler to bear
the ordinary working pressure; and second, from the gradual increase
of heat and pressure until the latter is greater than the boiler was
calculated to bear.

  [115] See Fifth Annual Report of the American Master Mechanics’
  Association, page 196.

Insufficient strength may be due: 1, to defects of the original design,
owing to the ignorance of the strains to which the material of the
boiler will be exposed, and its power of resistance; 2, to defective
workmanship and material, which can usually be discovered by careful
inspection; 3, to the reduction of the original strength of the boiler
by ordinary wear and tear or neglect, which can also usually be
discovered by careful inspection.

The first two causes have been fully discussed in the part relating
to boiler construction, and the last under the head of inspection of
locomotives.

Over-pressure is nearly always due to some defect of the safety-valve,
or to the fact that it is overloaded. This latter often occurs when
safety-valves are set by a defective steam gauge, which indicates too
little pressure. Over-pressure may also occur by letting an engine
stand alone with a large fire in its fire-box and possibly with the
blower turned on.

A boiler may, by suddenly opening the throttle-valve, undoubtedly be
subjected to very severe strain that may possibly be sufficient to
cause its destruction, even though it had sufficient strength to bear
the ordinary pressure at which the safety-valve blows off. Suddenly
opening or closing the throttle-valve may produce a violent rush
of steam and water against the part of the boiler whence the steam
is drawn. The percussion of the water and steam in such cases has
been known to shake the whole boiler, and to lift the safety-valve
momentarily right off its seat.[116] The weakest parts of a locomotive
are the two sides where the barrel joins the outside fire-box. Many
boilers, especially those with a high wagon-top, have flat spaces at
this point, which it is impossible to stay properly. It is at this
point, too, that the expansion and contraction of the tubes and the
outside shell exert their greatest strains, and it will therefore be
found, generally, that the seams at this point begin to leak before
any others, and for these reasons it is believed that all the seams
which join the outside shell of the fire-box to the barrel should be
double-riveted.

  [116] Wilson on Boiler Construction.

The practice of ascribing steam-boiler explosions to obscure causes has
been productive of much mischief, as it engenders a carelessness on
the part of those having charge of them, who have been led to believe
that no amount of care will avail against the mysterious agents at
work within the boiler. Explosions are also, in the absence of other
convenient reasons, very generally attributed to shortness of water.
This is often nothing more than a convenient method of shifting the
responsibility from the builder or owner of the locomotive to the
runner or fireman, who, if not killed by the explosion, in many cases
might just as well be, so far as his ability to defend himself is
concerned.[117]

  [117] Wilson on Boiler Construction.

QUESTION 513. _What should a locomotive runner and fireman do to avoid
and prevent explosions?_

_Answer._ 1. The height of the water in the boiler should always be
maintained so as to cover the heating surfaces. 2. The boiler should be
kept as clean, that is, as free from scale, mud and other impurities,
as possible. 3. It should never be subjected to strains from sudden
heating or cooling. 4. The steam-gauge and safety-valves should be
examined and tested frequently, to be sure they are in order; and 5,
they should examine every part of the boiler which is accessible, but
especially the stay-bolts, to see that there is no fracture of any part
or any injurious corrosion or other dangerous defect.

QUESTION 514. _What should be done in case of the bursting or collapse
of a tube?_

_Answer._ As soon as possible after it occurs, the runner must stop the
train, and close first the end of the flue in the fire-box, and then
that in the smoke-box, by driving in _iron plugs_, which are usually
provided for the purpose. These plugs are attached to the end of a bar,
with which they are inserted into the tubes. If the escape of water
and steam from the tube is so great as to make it difficult to see the
end of the tube, the steam may sometimes be drawn up the chimney by
starting the blower. If, however, the escape is so great as to make it
impossible to insert the plug, then the steam pressure must be reduced
by running with both pumps on, or by starting the injector; or it may
be necessary to draw the fire and cool off the engine. When a flue
collapses, the front end of which is behind the steam or petticoat
pipes, it is usually necessary to cool off the engine before a plug
can be inserted, especially if any considerable amount of water and
steam escape from it. While driving in the plug, the runner and fireman
should always keep themselves in such positions that the plug can not
hit them in case it is blown out by the steam. If the engine is not
supplied with iron flue-plugs, a wooden plug can be cut of the proper
size and driven in. This can be attached to the bar referred to and
inserted; but if no such bar is carried with the engine, the wooden
plug can be made on the end of a long pole and then cut nearly off. It
is then inserted into the flue and driven in and broken off. It will be
found that such plugs will burn off even with the end of the flue, but
will not burn entirely out.

QUESTION 515. _What should be done in case a bolt, stud or rivet blows
out of the boiler and thus allows the steam or hot water to escape?_

_Answer._ If it is accessible, cut a plug on the end of a long pole and
drive it in in the same way as described above. This will avoid the
necessity of cooling off the engine; but in some cases it will be found
that a plug can not be inserted or driven in without drawing the fire
and cooling off the boiler.

QUESTION 516. _In case it is found necessary to draw the fire and cool
off the boiler, and if so much water has escaped as to uncover the
crown plate, what must be done?_

_Answer._ If the leak has been stopped or the fault remedied, one of
the safety-valves should be taken off and water poured into the boiler
with pails or buckets through the opening left by the removal of the
safety-valve until the crown sheet is covered. The fire may then be
kindled again and the engine complete its journey. When bituminous
coal is used for fuel, the necessity for drawing the fire in case of
accident may often be avoided by completely covering or “banking” the
fire with fine coal which has been wet, and closing the dampers and
opening the furnace door. In this way the fire may be smothered and the
boiler cooled without putting the fire out, so that after the defect is
remedied it will not be necessary to rekindle it.

QUESTION 517. _What must be done in case of the failure of one or both
of the feed pumps or of the injector or check-valve?_

_Answer._ If one of the pumps fails the other one may be used, but
the defect or obstruction to the first should be remedied as soon as
possible, because the second may also fail. It will then be necessary
to depend upon the injector alone, if there is one, for feeding the
boiler. Only after all the appliances for feeding the boiler have
failed and the water is so low as to be in danger of exposing the crown
sheet, should the fire be drawn or banked, and the runner should then
at once give the proper signals for warning and the protection of his
train, and if he is unable to repair the pumps or injector, he must
send for aid to the nearest accessible point.

QUESTION 518. _In case a pump fails, how should it be examined in order
to discover the defect?_

_Answer._ As explained in the answer to Question 458, the working
of a pump is usually indicated by the stream which escapes from the
pet-cock. If, when this is opened, steam and water escape, it is an
indication that the check-valve is not working properly. When this
occurs hot water will escape if the pet-cock is opened when the engine
is standing still, but the pump may still feed the boiler if the upper
or pressure-valve works properly. When the check-valve does not work as
it should, it is also indicated by the heating of the feed-pipe, owing
to the escape of hot water from the boiler through the check-valve
when the pet-cock is opened. If, when the plunger is drawn out of the
pump, air is sucked in through the open pet-cock, then the upper or
pressure-valve of the pump does not work, but the working of the pump
may still be secured by the working of the check-valve; but if the
pump, air-chamber and feed-pipe then get filled with air, the plunger
may compress this air at each stroke, and as it can then follow the
plunger during its outward stroke, the latter will not suck water, but
will simply compress the air during the inward stroke, which will then
expand during the outward stroke. This will be indicated by the escape
of air from the pet-cock when the plunger is moving inward, and the
suction of air when the plunger is moving outward. This can be known by
holding the hand in front of the pet-cock. Usually, however, the air is
mixed with water so that the stream which escapes from the pet-cock is
broken or irregular. If air escapes from the pet-cock during the inward
stroke of the plunger, but none is sucked in during the outward stroke,
it shows that there is a leak somewhere in the pump or pipes, and that
it is pumping air instead of water. The leak may be in the stuffing-box
of the plunger, the joints of the pump or pipes, in the hose or their
connections with the supply-pipe or tender. If neither air nor water
escapes from the pet-cock during the inward stroke of the pump plunger,
or, if the stream of water at that time is weak, then it indicates that
the suction or lower valve of the pump is not working properly. The
same thing will occur if the pipe, pump or tender-valve is obstructed.
If there is a cock, as there always should be, just above the
suction-valve, it will aid us very much to discover the fault when the
pump will not work. If, when this cock is opened, cold water escapes
from it, the fault is in the suction-valve; if hot water, then it is
the pressure and check-valves which are leaky, obstructed or broken,
and consequently the hot water from the boiler leaks back into the
pump. In the absence of such a cock, the fault can often be discovered
by feeling the pump barrel with the hand. If the pump can not be made
to work, and the fault is found to be in the lower valve, it must be
taken out and examined; or if the fault is in the pipes, it can usually
be easily remedied. If the pipes are burst with only a small fracture,
it can usually be remedied by covering the aperture with canvas or
rubber and wrapping twine around it tightly. The upper valve of a pump
must, however, never be taken down without first being sure that the
check-valve is tight, because if it is not, the person will be likely
to be scalded in taking the pump apart.

Directions for managing an injector, and also for taking care of pumps
in cold weather, have already been given in the answers to Questions
142 and 488.

QUESTION 519. _What should be done in case of the breaking or bursting
of a cylinder or cylinder-head?_

_Answer._ The main connecting rod must be taken down on that side of
the engine. The piston should then be moved to the front or back end of
the cylinder and wooden blocks be placed between the guides so as to
fill up the space between the cross-head and the end of the guide-bars,
and thus prevent the cross-head and piston from moving. The valve stem
should then be disconnected from the rocker, and the valve moved to the
middle of the valve face, so as to cover up both steam-ports. It must
then be fastened in that position by screwing up _one_ of the bolts
of the stuffing-box of the valve stem, so as to make the gland bind
against the valve stem. The train should then be run cautiously to the
next station with the use of _one_ cylinder. If the engine is not able
to haul the train with one cylinder, then it should be uncoupled from
the train and run to the first telegraph station or other point where
the aid of a helping engine can be obtained or telegraphed for. In the
meanwhile the train must be protected by the proper signals. Should
the engine continue its journey with one cylinder, it must be started,
if it should happen to be standing at the dead point, by _pushing_ or
by means of _crow-bars_. In so doing, however, the bars should not be
put between the spokes of the wheels, as they may easily be caught in
the wheels when the engine starts, and in this way the spokes be broken
or the persons who are using the crow-bars be badly hurt.

QUESTION 520. _What must be done in case a steam-chest or steam-pipe is
broken?_

_Answer._ If a steam-chest is broken a block of wood should be bolted
over the mouth of the steam passage, so as to prevent the escape of
the steam from the steam-pipe on that side. It will sometimes require
considerable ingenuity to devise means of fastening such a block or
blocks of wood so as to cover the mouth of the steam passage. As
cylinders are now usually made, the blocks can be fastened by cutting
them to the proper form and size, and then placing a thick block on
top, and bolting the steam-chest cover down on top of it. If the cover
is broken, a part of it may be used or a piece of plank with a few
holes bored into it be employed instead. In some cases a piece of
board can be bolted over the end of the steam-pipe. When the latter is
broken, it should be taken down and a piece of board or plank bolted
over the opening of the ~⊤~-pipe to which the steam-pipe was attached.
The engine can then be run with one cylinder as before, although
usually in such cases it is not necessary to disconnect any other parts
than the valve stem.

QUESTION 521. _What must be done if a piston, cross-head,
connecting-rod or crank-pin is broken or bent?_

_Answer._ If the piston, cross-head or main connecting-rod is broken,
the same course must be pursued as when a cylinder is broken. If a
coupling-rod or a crank-pin of a trailing-wheel is broken, then it is
necessary to take down both the coupling-rods, but not to disconnect
the main connecting-rods or their attachments, unless they are injured.

QUESTION 522. _If one coupling-rod is broken or taken down, why must
the other be taken down also?_

_Answer._ Because if only one rod is used there is then nothing to help
the cranks of the trailing wheels past the dead-points, so that in
starting, or if they are moving slowly when they reach these points,
they are quite as likely to revolve in one direction as the other.
If they happen to turn in the reverse direction to that in which the
wheels to which they are coupled are moving, then the crank-pins of one
or the other pair of wheels are very liable to be broken or bent.

QUESTION 523. _What must be done if a driving-wheel tire or
driving-axle breaks?_

_Answer._ If a tire on a main driving-wheel or the wheel itself
breaks, the driving-box of the broken wheel or tire should be held up
by putting a wooden block under the box. An ordinary American engine
can then be run on three driving-wheels, but it must be run with the
utmost caution. If the engine has more than four driving-wheels there
is usually less difficulty in running it, if one of the main wheels
is injured, than if there are only four. But it is almost impossible
to give directions which will be applicable to all the accidents of
this kind that may occur to different kinds of engines. If none of the
connecting-rods, crank-pins or crank-pin bosses are injured, it is not
necessary to disconnect either side, but if the injury is of such a
nature that the coupling-rod must be taken down on one side, the one
on the other side must be taken down too. If the main crank-pin and
connecting-rod are not disabled, both cylinders may be used even if
one of the main wheels or tires is broken. But even if one side of the
engine must be entirely disconnected, the engine may still be run with
one cylinder and by driving one wheel. If a main axle breaks the engine
can usually be run, but great caution must be exercised. In such cases,
however, if assistance or a telegraph office is near where the accident
occurs, it is usually best to send for assistance at once, rather than
take the risks which attend the attempt to run an engine so seriously
injured.

QUESTION 524. _What must be done when a trailing or leading
driving-wheel, tire or axle breaks?_

_Answer._ Very much the same course must be pursued as was described
in the previous answer, although it is generally less difficult to run
with a trailing or leading axle broken than it is when the main axle
has met with such an accident.

QUESTION 525. _What must be done if an engine-truck wheel or axle
breaks?_

_Answer._ It is usually best to chain up the end of the truck-frame
over the broken axle or wheel to the engine frame and place a cross-tie
across the other end of the truck-frame, between it and the engine
frame, so that the weight of the engine may rest on the cross-tie.
If a part of the flange or a piece of the wheel is broken out, the
wheels should be turned around so that the unbroken part will rest on
the rail, and they should then be chained or otherwise fastened so
that they cannot revolve, and thus be made to slide on the rails and
carry the weight of the engine in that way. The same plan is employed
if a tender wheel breaks, but one end of a tender-truck frame must be
chained up. It is usually necessary to place a cross-tie across the top
of the tender, and fasten the chains to it.

QUESTION 526. _What must be done in case a driving-spring,
spring-hanger or equalizing-lever breaks?_

_Answer._ As the breaking of a spring or spring-hanger may cause a
more serious accident, the engine and train should be stopped as soon
as possible after it occurs. If the hanger is broken and there is a
duplicate on hand, it should be substituted in place of the broken
one. If there is no duplicate, then the spring should be taken down,
and a wooden block be placed between the top of the driving-box and
the frame to support the weight which before rested on the spring. In
order to insert this block, if it is a front spring which is broken, it
is usually best to raise the engine with jack-screws or run the back
wheels on inclined blocks of wood placed under each of the back wheels.
This raises the weight off from the front-wheels, and the block can
then be inserted between the box and frame. If it is one of the springs
over the back wheels which is broken, the front wheels should be run on
the wooden wedges. Such wedges can soon be cut out of a cross-tie with
an axe, or by sawing a square stick of wood diagonally it will make
two such wedges. The end of the equalizing lever next to the broken
spring must be supported by inserting a piece of wood under it. This
will usually be held securely by the weight which is suspended from the
opposite end, bearing the blocked end down on the block.

QUESTION 527. _What should be done if an engine-truck or tender spring
breaks?_

_Answer._ Very much the same course must be pursued that is employed
when a driving-spring breaks, excepting that usually the weight can be
lifted off from a truck-box easier by placing a jack under the end of
the truck-frame than by the method described. Usually, too, each of the
truck-springs supports the weight on two of the wheels, so that the two
boxes must be blocked up.

QUESTION 528. _What must be done in case the engine-frame is broken?_

_Answer._ Usually very little need be done excepting to exercise more
than usual caution in running, and to reduce the speed. Of course the
breakage of a frame may disable the engine, but ordinarily in such
accidents that is not the case.

QUESTION 529. _How can it be known if an eccentric has slipped on the
axle?_

_Answer._ It is indicated at once by the irregular sound of the
exhaust, or, as locomotive runners say, the engine will be “_lame_.”

QUESTION 530. _When it is known that an eccentric has slipped, how can
it be learned which is the one that is misplaced?_

_Answer._ This can usually be learned by examining the marks which
should always be made on the eccentrics and on the axles. If no such
marks have been made by the builder of the engine, the runner himself
should make them, after the valves have been set correctly. The effect
upon the valve when an eccentric slips is either to increase or
diminish the lead. Therefore, by running the engine slowly with the
link first in full forward and then in full back gear, and observing
whether steam is admitted at each end of the cylinder just before the
crank reaches the dead points, it can be known which eccentric has
moved. If it has slipped in one direction the lead will be increased
and steam will be admitted to the cylinder some time before the piston
reaches the end of the stroke. If it has moved the opposite way, the
lead will be diminished and steam will not be admitted until after the
piston has reached the end of its stroke. The admission of steam will
be indicated by its escape from the cylinder cocks.

QUESTION 531. _If by any means the valve stem or either of the
eccentric rods should be lengthened or shortened, how can it be known?_

_Answer._ The crank on one side should be placed at one of the dead
points and the cylinder-cocks opened; then admit a little steam to the
cylinder, by opening the throttle-valve slightly, and throw the reverse
lever from full gear forward to full gear backward, and observe whether
steam escapes all the time from the end of the cylinder at which the
piston stands. Then repeat the operation with the crank at the other
dead point. If either of the eccentric rods or the valve stem have
been lengthened or shortened, it will cause the valve to cover the
steam-port either at the front or back end of the cylinder, so that
no steam will escape from the cock at that end. If the length of one
of the eccentric rods has been changed, then when the altered rod is
in gear the valve will have too little or no lead at one end of the
cylinder and too much at the other. If, therefore, this occurs when the
forward rod is in gear and _not_ in back gear, it indicates that the
length of the forward rod has been altered. If the reverse occurs it
shows that it is the back-motion rod whose length has been changed. It
must be observed that if the length of an eccentric rod is altered the
lead will be changed only at that part of the link which is operated
by the altered rod. That is, if the forward eccentric rod is too long
or too short, the lead at the front and back ends of the cylinder
in forward gear only will be affected. If the back eccentric rod is
changed the valve will be affected only in back gear. If, however, the
length of the valve stem is changed, the lead will be changed in both
forward and back gear. The valves on each side of the engine can, of
course, be tested in the same way.

QUESTION 532. _When it is discovered which eccentric has slipped, how
should it be reset?_

_Answer._ If it has been marked, it is simply turned back so that the
marks correspond with each other again. This is done by first loosening
the set-screws, and, after the eccentric is turned to the proper place,
tightening them up again. When an eccentric slips it is often caused
by the cutting of the eccentric-straps, valve or other part of the
valve-gear, so that these should always be examined to see whether
they are properly oiled. If the eccentrics have not been marked, the
valve may be set by placing the crank at the forward dead-point, and
the reverse lever in the front notch of the sector and the full part
of the forward-motion eccentric _above_ the axle. Then admit a little
steam into the steam-chest, open the cylinder cocks, and move the
forward-motion eccentric slowly forward until steam escapes from the
front cylinder cock, which will show that the steam-port is opened and
the valve has some lead. To set the backward-motion eccentric the crank
is placed in the same position, but the reverse lever is thrown into
the back notch and the full part of the eccentric is placed _below_ the
axle. Then move this eccentric forward until steam escapes from the
_front_ cylinder cock as before. In order to verify the position of
the eccentrics the crank may be placed at the back dead-point and the
reverse lever moved backward and forward, at the same time observing
whether steam escapes from the back cylinder cock when the link is in
back and forward gear.

QUESTION 533. _What should be done in case an eccentric-strap or rod,
or rocker arm or shaft, or the valve stem breaks?_

_Answer._ If an eccentric-strap or rod breaks, the broken rod and strap
should be taken down, and the valve-stem disconnected from the rocker
and the valve fastened in the middle position of the valve face, and
the engine should be run with one cylinder only. The same course must
usually be pursued if a rocker breaks. If the valve-stem breaks, it is
not necessary to disconnect the link and eccentric rods, but simply to
fasten the valve in the centre of the valve face.

QUESTION 534. _If a link hanger or saddle, or a lifting arm should
break, what may be done?_

Answer. The valve-gear may be used on that side of the engine by
putting a wooden block in the link slot above the link block, so as
to support the link near the position at which it works the valve
full stroke forward. Of course the engine can then be run in only one
direction, and should therefore be run with the utmost caution. If,
however, it should be necessary to back the train on a side track, it
can be done by taking out the wooden block and substituting a longer
one, so that the link will be supported in a position near that at
which it works the valve full stroke backward. These blocks must be
fastened in some way, either with rope or twine, so that they will be
held in their position when the engine is at work.

QUESTION 535. _If the lifting shaft itself or its vertical arm, the
reverse lever or rod, should break, what can be done?_

_Answer._ If it is impossible to devise any temporary substitute or
method of mending them, both links can be blocked up as described above.

QUESTION 536. _In case the throttle-valve should fail, what should be
done?_

_Answer._ If such an accident occurs, especially if it happens about a
station, it is attended with great danger. If it is found that steam
can not be shut off from the cylinders with the throttle-valve, then
the reverse lever should be placed in the middle of the sector. If
this does not prevent the engine from moving, the reverse lever should
be alternately thrown into forward and then into back gear, and at
the same time every aperture, such as the safety-valve and heater
cocks, should be opened, and every means be taken to cool the boiler
as quickly as possible. The fireman should open the furnace door,
close the ash-pan dampers, and start the blower so as to draw a strong
current of cold air into the furnace and through the tubes. At the same
time the injector should be started and the fire drawn as quickly as
possible. After the boiler is cooled, the cover of the steam-dome may
be removed and the valve examined if the defect can not be discovered
in any other way. Of course if the accident occurs on the open road,
the train must be at once protected by sending out signals in each
direction.

QUESTION 537. _What must be done in case a coupling breaks?_

_Answer._ When a coupling between the cars or tender breaks, if the
front end of the train is immediately stopped, there will be danger
that the back end of it, which is broken loose, will run into the front
end, and thus do great damage. As it always occurs, when a coupling
of a passenger train breaks, that the signal bell in the cab is rung,
the first impulse of a runner under such circumstances is to stop the
engine. He should, however, be careful not to do so if on shutting off
steam he finds that the train has broken in two, but should at once
open the throttle in order to get the front end of the train out of
the way of the rear end. The ease with which the speed of a train is
arrested with continuous brakes has increased the danger of accident
from this cause. Usually a runner learns by the sudden start of the
engine that the train has separated, and when that occurs he should
never apply the brakes.

QUESTION 538. _If from any cause the supply of water in the tender
becomes exhausted, what must be done?_

_Answer._ It is best, if it can be done without risk of injury to the
engine, to run the train on a side track and then draw the fire. If no
water can be obtained near enough to supply the tender with buckets,
help must be sent for; but if there is a well, stream or pond of water
near, the tender can be partly filled by carrying water.

QUESTION 539. _In case an engine becomes blockaded in a snow storm with
plenty of fuel, but runs out of water, what can be done?_

_Answer._ Snow should be shoveled into the tender and steam admitted
through the heater cocks so as to melt the snow.

QUESTION 540. _If a locomotive without an injector should be obstructed
in a snow storm or in any other way so that it could not move, and
therefore could not work the pumps, what should be done in case the
water in the boiler should get low?_

_Answer._ The weight of the engine should be lifted off from the
main driving-wheels and the coupling rods disconnected from the main
crank-pin, so that the main wheels can turn without moving the engine.
These can then be run and the pumps thus be worked. The weight can
usually be most conveniently taken off from the main wheels by running
the trailing wheels on wooden blocks, and thus raising up the back end
of the engine.

QUESTION 541. _If it is impossible, in a snow storm or in very cold
weather, to keep steam in the boiler without danger, what should be
done?_

_Answer._ Draw the fire, blow all the water out of the boiler, empty
the tanks, disconnect the hose and slacken up the joints in the pumps
and injector so that all the water in them can escape, and thus prevent
them from freezing up.




PART XXIX.

ACCIDENTS AND INJURIES TO PERSONS.


QUESTION 542. _In case an accident occurs and one or more persons are
seriously injured, what can be done by those present?_

_Answer._ In such cases it very often happens that with knowledge and
sufficient coolness to apply that knowledge, one or more non-medical
persons who are present when an accident occurs can do as much or more
toward saving life and allaying pain, _before_ a doctor comes, than he
can _afterwards_. The following cases cited by Dr. Howe in his book on
“Emergencies” will illustrate this:

“_Case 1._--A machinist was admitted to a New York hospital suffering
from wounds of the wrist and palm of the hand. On arriving at the
hospital the entire clothing on one side of his body was saturated with
blood, from the loss of which he was partly insensible. On making an
examination, it was found by the surgeon that a folded handkerchief was
bandaged over the centre of the wrist, and that the wound in the palm
of the hand was untouched. The pad was placed on the wrist, as if the
greatest care had been exercised to avoid pressing on either of the two
arteries. The bleeding in this case could easily have been controlled
if the bandage and pad had been properly applied. The patient,
however, developed erysipelas, and, not having sufficient vitality to
carry him through, died the fifth day.”

“_Case 2._--A laborer fell from the front platform of a car at Harlem,
and had his right foot crushed by one of the wheels. An ordinary
bandage was placed on the limb without any compress over the vessels.
In bringing the man to the hospital, the rough jolting of the carriage
set the wound bleeding, and by the time he reached his destination
he was apparently lifeless. The vessels were tied and stimulants
administered, but he never rallied. Death occurred six hours after his
admission. His injuries, independent of the bleeding, might indeed have
terminated his life; still the chances would have been in his favor if
a compress had been applied to the limb to prevent bleeding. The fact
that such a thing was not done shows either culpable negligence or
deplorable ignorance.”

Many similar cases constantly occur where a little intelligent timely
action of those present would save the life of an injured person, who
without such help must die before professional surgical aid can be
obtained.

QUESTION 543. _When it is found that one or more persons are seriously
injured, what is the first thing to be done?_

_Answer._ The first thing to do is to extricate the person or persons
from the danger, and at the same time send a messenger for a doctor. If
it is doubtful if one can be obtained by sending in one direction, send
two or more messengers in different directions.

QUESTION 544. _To what kind of injuries are locomotive runners and
other persons employed or traveling on railroads exposed?_

_Answer._ They are liable to be bruised or crushed in case of collision
or running off the track, or of injury from falling off the train, or
of being run over by a moving train. Brakemen and others whose duty
it is to couple cars are liable to have their hands, arms or bodies
crushed between the cars, and locomotive runners are sometimes burned
or scalded if an accident happens to their engines. Train-men are also
frequently exposed to very great cold in winter and heat in summer,
and are thus liable to be frost-bitten or sun-struck. Passengers are
seldom injured excepting through their own carelessness, unless in
cases of collision or running off the track and the destruction of the
cars. Strangers and even railroad employes are frequently run over by
trains while walking on the track, and frequent accidents occur to deaf
people in this way, and it is not very unusual to hear of train-men
who sit on the main track at night while their trains are waiting on
the side-track for another train to pass, go to sleep while in that
position, and then are run over by the passing train.

QUESTION 545. _When persons are crushed or dangerously wounded, what
are the chief immediate sources of danger and death when their wounds
are not necessarily fatal?_

_Answer._ First, excessive bleeding in case an artery is ruptured;
second, the shock to the whole system, from which the sufferer may not
have the strength to recover.

QUESTION 546. _When does bleeding from a wound become dangerous?_

_Answer._ Profuse bleeding is always dangerous, but it should be
remembered that bleeding occurs from two sources: first from the
arteries, which are the vessels which convey the blood _from_ the
heart, and second from the veins, through which the blood flows back
to the heart. The first is called _arterial_ bleeding and the second
_venous_ bleeding. Now it must be remembered that the heart is the
great force-pump of the body, and that it supplies all parts of the
body with blood, somewhat as the feed-pump of a locomotive supplies the
boiler with water. The arteries referred to fulfill the same purpose
that the feed-pipe does to a locomotive pump--they convey the fluid
from the pump to the place where it is needed. Now the blood is forced
into these arteries with a certain amount of pressure, so that if any
of them are cut or injured the blood will flow out in a jet or spurt
just as the water will escape from a feed-pipe if that is ruptured. The
blood which flows through the veins back to the heart may, on the other
hand, be compared to the water in the supply pipes of a locomotive
pump, that is, there is very little pressure on it, and therefore if
they are injured the flow of blood from them is less rapid than from
the arteries. It will therefore be seen that arterial bleeding is much
more dangerous, because the blood flows from them under a pressure.

QUESTION 547. _How can arterial bleeding be distinguished from venous
bleeding?_

_Answer._ The blood is of a bright scarlet color, and is forced out
in successive jets; each jet corresponds with the movements of the
heart. This characteristic spurting is caused by the intermittent
force-pump action of the heart, driving out the blood. Venous bleeding
is distinguished from arterial by the dark-blue color of the blood when
flowing from the wound. It never flows in repeated jets, but oozes
slowly from the wounded surfaces. Venous blood is traveling toward the
heart, and there is consequently little force behind to cause a more
rapid flow. This form of bleeding is comparatively harmless, unless
occurring from very large veins.[118]

  [118] “Emergencies and How to Treat Them,” by Joseph W. Howe, M. D.

QUESTION 548. _How can the bleeding be stopped in case an artery is cut
or ruptured?_

_Answer._ The most efficient and available method is the application of
PRESSURE on the artery BETWEEN THE WOUND AND THE HEART. Under ordinary
circumstances this can be most effectively done with what is called a
_field tourniquet_, which is simply a handkerchief passed around the
limb above the wound, the ends of which are then tied together. A pad
is then made, either of cloth rolled up, a piece of wood, or a round
stone about the size of a hen’s egg well wrapped, or any substance
from which a firm pad can be quickly made, which is placed over the
artery. The handkerchief is then placed over the pad and a short stick
put through it on the opposite side of the limb and twisted around
until the pad compresses the artery firmly. While the tourniquet is
being prepared, some one should compress the artery with his fingers or
thumb, so as to prevent as much loss of blood as possible.

QUESTION 549. _What is the position of the arteries in the body and how
can their location be known?_

[Illustration: Fig. 230.]

_Answer._ The position of the principal arteries is shown in fig. 230.
They proceed from the heart _h_ with branches, _a_, _a_, and _b_, _b_,
which extend along each limb. These branches subdivide again below the
knees and elbows, and again in the hands and feet. The position of the
arteries can be felt by their pulsation at almost any part of them, but
when they are buried below the muscles it is more difficult than when
they are near the surface.

QUESTION 550. _In case of a wound and rupture of the arteries in the
arm, what should be done?_

_Answer._ The artery at _a_ should be firmly compressed with the
thumb until a bandage and pad from which a tourniquet can be made are
prepared. The pad should then be applied over the artery and compressed
as explained in answer to Question 548. The bleeding can also be
stopped by placing a round piece of wood or other form of pad between
the arm at _a_ and the body and then tying the arm tightly against the
body, so that the pad will be pressed against the arm.

QUESTION 551. _In case of rupture to an artery below the knee, where
should the pressure be applied?_

_Answer._ The artery approaches near the surface at _c_, _c_,
immediately back of the knee, where it is represented in dotted lines
in fig. 230. Pressure should therefore be applied at that point first
with the thumb until a tourniquet can be applied. The bleeding can also
be stopped by elevating the leg and allowing it to rest on the back
of a chair or other similar support. The weight of the leg will then
bring sufficient pressure on the artery to stop the bleeding. A towel
or other soft material should be placed over the back of the chair, so
that the pressure will not be too painful to the sufferer.

QUESTION 552. _If an artery is ruptured in the leg above the knee,
where should the pressure be applied?_

_Answer._ In the thigh at _b_, where the beating or pulsations in the
artery can be distinctly felt. The reader should familiarize himself
with the position of the arteries by feeling their location in his own
body. By doing so he may be able to save the life of a companion or
other person in case of accident, whereas without such knowledge the
injured person would die.

QUESTION 553. _After the arterial bleeding has been stopped, if blood
should continue to ooze out of the wound, what should be done?_

_Answer._ The wound should be filled with lint or cotton waste; and
the limb then be bandaged by beginning at its extremity and wrapping
the bandage closely and evenly around it so as to bring, as nearly as
possible, an equal pressure on the whole of it. Bandaging the limb in
this way up to the point where the pressure is applied to the artery,
will prevent swelling, and the veins will be compressed so that the
blood will not flow from their torn extremities.

QUESTION 554. _When the bleeding has been stopped, what should be done?_

_Answer._ The injured person should be laid in as comfortable a place
as can be procured for him, and should be given a moderate drink of
water. If much exhausted, two or three tablespoonsful of brandy or
whisky, mixed with an equal quantity of water, should be given first,
and smaller quantities, _of not_ MORE THAN A TABLESPOONFUL at a time,
should then be given every half hour. Usually wounded persons are given
too much stimulant, so that frequently they are injured more than they
are benefited thereby.

After a person has lost much blood, he feels an intolerable thirst, but
if too much water is given him, he is apt to become sick and vomit,
which weakens him still more. It is therefore best to give him very
little water, say a teaspoonful at a time, after the first drink, or if
ice can be obtained, give the sufferer pieces of ice frequently, which
can be allowed to melt slowly in his mouth.

QUESTION 555. _When a person is insensible, what should be done for
him?_

_Answer._ Lay him down in as comfortable a place as the circumstances
will permit, and protect him from cold, rain or hot sun, as may be
needed. A common error is to place injured and insensible persons in an
erect position or in a chair. If he is insensible he should _always_ be
laid down with his head slightly lower than his body. Then water should
be dashed two or three times on his face, and warm bricks, stones or
pieces of iron, such as coupling links or pins, applied to his feet
and in the arm-pits and between the thighs, being careful that the
warm objects applied are not hot enough to burn. Then cover the person
with blankets, heavy coats or anything else which will keep him warm.
Wounded persons soon become cold and chilled, the effects of which are
very injurious, and therefore especial pains should be taken to keep
them warm. In very cold weather there is great danger that injured
persons will be frost-bitten, which must be carefully guarded against.

In case of shock, when the injured person lies pale, faint, cold
and sometimes insensible, with feeble pulse and labored breathing,
anything like excitement must be avoided, as it tends to exhaust the
patient.

All assistance and attention should be given to a wounded person with
the least noise and excitement, and all crowds and idle spectators
should be driven away and every effort made to keep the sufferer
comfortable and quiet. If food is given it should be in the form of
beef tea or broth, and in small quantities at a time.

QUESTION 556. _In case any bones are broken, what should be done?_

_Answer._ The limb should be supported as comfortably as possible until
a doctor’s services can be obtained. There is danger with a broken limb
that the bones will protrude through the flesh and skin, to avoid which
the limb should be placed in a natural position and laid on a pillow,
car cushion or other soft object. This should then be wrapped around
the limb and tied in this position, so as to prevent any movement of
the broken bones.

QUESTION 557. _If a person is crushed or severely burned, what should
be done?_

_Answer._ The immediate danger from such injuries arises from the
“shock” to the system. It is usually best to bandage the part which is
crushed until surgical aid can be obtained, and the sufferer treated as
explained in answer to Question 548.

QUESTION 558. _What should be done for a person who has been burned or
scalded?_

_Answer._ Lint or cotton waste saturated with molasses and water
should be applied to the wound, or the latter should be dusted with
wheat flour, and then dressed with lint or cotton waste, and loosely
bandaged. If the injury should be severe, a shivering followed by
depression is very likely to come on. To check this, warmth in the form
of hot applications and stimulants should be used, as already explained.

QUESTION 559. _What should be done for a frost-bite?_

_Answer._ Warmth should be applied to the frozen part very gradually
by rubbing with snow or pouring cold water on it. The occurrence of
stinging pain, with a change in color, is a signal to stop all rubbing
or other measure which might excite inflammation. If the frozen part
turns black the next day, a poultice should be applied.

If persons exposed to the cold become very much exhausted or sleepy,
stimulants should be given, as explained in answer to Question 554, and
the body briskly rubbed with the hands and warm flannel or other woolen
material.

QUESTION 560. _How should a person be treated who has been sun-struck?_

_Answer._ Apply cold water or ice to the head, place the sufferer in a
cool place, and make him comfortable. After being sun-struck the person
should not work for some days or weeks thereafter, until his health and
strength are fully recovered.




PART XL.

RESPONSIBILITY AND QUALIFICATIONS OF LOCOMOTIVE RUNNERS.[119]


  [119] NOTE.--The greater part of this chapter is a translation from
  Prof. George Kosak’s “Katechismus der Einrichtung und des Betriebes
  der Locomotive.”

QUESTION 561. _What are the dangers to which the runner and the fireman
are exposed by their work on the engine?_

_Answer._ Runners and firemen are not only exposed to great bodily
injury or even death by every accident which may happen to their
engine, but unless they are very careful to preserve their health it is
quickly destroyed by the constant changes of the weather to which their
position exposes them, and also by the effect of the heat of the fire
and by the smoke by which they are often surrounded.

In order to protect themselves in a measure from the injurious effects
of change of weather, smoke, cold, etc., frequent bathing and cleansing
of the skin are absolutely necessary, and also the wearing of a woolen
undershirt next the skin at all seasons.

The gases of coal which pour out of the furnace-door, if it is opened
when the throttle is closed, have an especially injurious effect on
the throat, lungs, etc. They should always see to it, therefore, that
the blower is always started before the fire-door is opened, in order
that these injurious gases, which have collected during a halt, may be
drawn forward and up the smoke-stack by the draft.

The steady, loud clatter which the engine makes while running has
an injurious influence on the nervous system. The runner should
therefore endeavor to lessen these shocks of the engine as far as
possible by keeping watch over it and keeping its parts accurately
adjusted. In order to keep himself fresh and strong in his service,
which is extremely exhaustive to body and mind, the runner must try to
strengthen himself by regular, temperate living, and eating abundant
nourishing food. The common use of strong drinks, which undermines the
mental and physical strength of men, should be avoided by a person
occupying the exhaustive and responsible position of a locomotive
runner. If in ordinary life a drunken man is unfit for any simple
work, how shall a drunken runner or fireman undertake the difficult
management of so great, so delicate and so costly a machine as a
locomotive? How can hundreds of men quietly trust their lives and limbs
to such a man, whom no one can help despising? Rightfully, therefore,
conscientious railroad managers place the greatest stress on the
_sobriety_ of the runners and firemen, and instantly discharge from
their service those who give themselves up to a passion for drink.

Owing to the demands which their daily labor makes upon their strength
and endurance, locomotive runners should be careful not to increase
the drain by dissipation, irregular hours or overwork. There seems to
be something about the power of endurance of the human frame analogous
to the capacity of a bar of iron or steel to resist strains. So long
as the strains do not exceed the elastic limit, that is if the bar
recovers its original length when the strain is removed, it will
bear millions of such strains without becoming weaker; but if it is
strained so hard that it is permanently stretched, then comparatively
few applications of the force will rupture the bar. In a similar way,
if the strain or fatigue which a man endures is no more than he will
recover from after the ordinary rest, he can endure an almost unlimited
number of such strains, but if the fatigue exceeds his “elastic limit,”
then he soon becomes permanently injured thereby. It often happens that
an excessive amount of work is unavoidable, but when it can be avoided
it should be by those who wish to preserve their health and strength.

In order to save themselves from great injuries, runners and firemen
should always act with the greatest caution, and never rush carelessly
into danger. They should never adopt the principle of foolhardy and
thoughtless people, who by the consciousness of continual danger fall
into the habit of carelessly “trusting to their luck,” etc. On the
contrary, they should always face the danger with their eyes open and
with the greatest conscientiousness. Many try to show great courage by
scorning the danger, and some such even wish to meet a little in order
to be able to show their pluck. These should bear in mind that they
have a great responsibility laid upon them, and that it is not alone
their own well-being or life which is at stake in case of any mishap,
but that by their careless behavior they may wound or kill the helpless
people who are committed to their care, cause incalculable misery by
robbing families of their sole support and of their children; and bring
great sorrow and mourning to their fellow-men. The thought of the
curse and the despair of the survivors may give sleepless hours even to
a locomotive runner who knows himself to have been without any fault
regarding an accident; how much more must it be with him who cannot
give himself this assurance? There are not wanting instances in which
the runner who caused such an accident by his thoughtlessness, driven
to despair by his own heavily-burdened conscience, went miserably to
ruin.

QUESTION 562. _What requirements and duties should every locomotive
runner fulfill?_

_Answer._ Every locomotive runner should fulfill the following
requirements and duties:

1. He should have an exact knowledge of the engine intrusted to him,
and a general knowledge of the nature and construction of steam
engines generally. Likewise, he should be perfectly familiar with the
management of the boiler, the running of the engine, and the way of
keeping the working parts in good condition; also, with the forms and
peculiarities of the line of road on which he runs, the rules which
govern the running of trains and with the signal system adopted.

2. _Health_ and _bodily strength_ he must have in abundant measure in
his position, which is exhausting and in which he is exposed to all
sorts of weather.

3. He should have a good, plain common-school education, and be ready
at reading, writing and arithmetic.

4. He should always carry out _exactly_ and _cheerfully_ the
regulations of the service, or the instructions given him by special
orders from the officers over him.

5. _Faithfulness_, _frankness_ and _honesty_, which characterize an
upright man in ordinary life, and also the strictest _temperance_ in
the use of strong drink, he should possess in a high degree in his very
responsible position.

6. He should have acquired a certain degree of skill in putting
together and taking apart locomotives, and also in repairing separate
parts of them. It is desirable that he should always be present when
his own engine is taken apart, put together or repaired, in order that
he may acquire a thorough knowledge of its condition and learn to
understand properly the importance of its various parts.

7. In caring for his engine he must preserve perfect cleanliness and
order, and in using fuel he must manifest the greatest care and rigid
economy.

8. Whenever there is danger, coolness and self-possession are
indispensably necessary, and any thoughtlessness or recklessness is to
be strictly avoided.

9. Towards his superior officers his behavior should be respectful
and obliging; towards those under him, patient and kindly, and at all
times he should avoid profanity and all intemperate language. He should
endeavor, as far as possible, to instruct the fireman who accompanies
him and make him familiar with the construction and management of the
engine, and should see that he does his work strictly in accordance
with his instructions.

It is the _fireman’s_ duty to follow the runner’s instructions
strictly, and in case of any sudden disability of the runner he must
stop the engine in accordance with the instructions given him, and
then give the proper signals for help, until another runner arrives.
In the meanwhile the engine is to be kept at a halt with all the usual
precautions.

10. The runner should try to keep himself informed of the progress and
improvement of locomotives by reading suitable hooks and technical
periodicals, and when possible acquire some skill in geometrical and
mechanical drawing, in order to accustom himself to accurate work and
sound and systematic thinking.

QUESTION 563. _What studies should mechanics, locomotive runners and
firemen take up, and what technical books should they read?_

_Answer._ As already stated, they should know how to read and write
their own language, and understand arithmetic and have some knowledge
of geography. Every locomotive runner and fireman has a good deal of
spare time, a part of which he can devote to study, and all of them,
even if they have not had the advantage of early education, could by
industry and perseverance acquire a knowledge of “reading, writing
and ciphering.” The assistance of a good teacher should always be
procured, if possible. With so much knowledge, some book on natural
philosophy can be read to advantage, and then some book on mechanics.
The following list of books is given, which the student will do well
to read in the order in which they are named. It should always be
remembered, however, that the mere buying of books contributes very
little knowledge to the owner. It is the reading and _understanding_
them which “increases knowledge.”

  Transcriber’s Notes


  Inconsistencies in spelling, lay-out, hyphenation, etc. have been
  retained, except as mentioned under Changes below.

  Some reference letters’ case in the text does not correspond to that
  shown in the illustration, and some of the reference letters are
  used inconsistently in different illustrations; this has not been
  rectified unless mentioned below. The not always numerical order of
  the illustrations in this e-text is the order of the source document.
  Depending on the hard- and software used to read this text and their
  settings, not all elements may display as intended. The scale as
  indicated in the illustrations in this e-text is not necessarily
  correct.

  Several characters as used in this text are used to represent the
  shape of the symbol or letter rather than the symbol’s (e.g., ⟂) or
  letter’s (e.g., ~U~) actual meaning.

  Page 47, ... a spiral spring, s s, fig. 31, which is compressed ...:
  the letters s are not visible in the illustration (the spring is).

  Page 52, ... if we construct a scale S, S, fig. 38, ...: the
  printing quality of the source document was not sufficient to make
  this entirely visible in the illustration; the text and fig. 39 may
  provide clarity. The parts that were legible have been enhanced.

  Page 77: Fig. 41 contains different reference letters h: two in the
  smoke stack (left-hand side of the illustration), one underneath the
  steam whistle. Both are referenced in the text.

  more words may be missing (... which will then be ... or similar).

  Page 154, ... with two handles, l, l, fig. 71, which are raised ...:
  reference letters l do not occur in the illustration (nor are they
  listed in the parts list following the illustration).

  W, not an M.

  Page 181, ... and the other two the reverse way: possibly an error
  for ... and the other the reverse way.

  an error for Scale ³⁄₁₆ in. = 1 inch.

  Changes made

  Footnotes and illustrations have been moved out of text paragraphs.
  Some of the illustrations have been rotated. Figure numbers and scale
  indicators have been removed from within some illustrations and have
  been transcribed as (top or bottom) captions.

  Where they were missing, periods have been added to illustration
  captions. Numbered questions have (where relevant) been standardised
  to end in a question mark. Reference letters in the text have been
  standardised to italics.

  Some obviously missing punctuation has been inserted; some minor
  obvious typographical errors were corrected silently. In some tables
  and lists ditto marks have been replaced with the dittoed text.

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
