                             INTRODUCTION.


In placing before the public this book on sundials and sundial verses I
suppose that I must conform to the usual order of things and apologise
for being on earth, but at the same time I am very grateful; and,
feeling so kindly disposed to FATHER TIME, I have ventured in verse to
extol his praises, and, with the kindly help of my artist, I have boldly
put before the public a work that has entailed considerable labour and
expense. If, then, any critic—confident in his or her powers of being
able to compile a work vastly superior in every detail to the one which
I have supreme pleasure in now placing before the public—should like to
enter the lists and vie with my humble efforts, I will gladly forgive
all criticism, and congratulate myself on having been instrumental in
securing for FATHER TIME a fresh devotee; and I will offer up my humble
prayers that he or she may prove to be a far more worthy servant than
myself.

But, apart from all levity, let me here simply testify to the onerous
nature of my self-imposed task, and express the hope that my untutored
efforts may in part, if not in whole, be appreciated by a few generous
natures who, being themselves unable to devote time to the compilation
of such a work, yet are grateful for this contribution (no matter how
faulty) to what has ever been a most pleasing and engrossing subject.

He would, indeed, be a mean man who, having received considerable
assistance in any undertaking, failed to acknowledge such on the first
opportunity; and I have the greatest pleasure in here testifying to the
untiring efforts of my artist, Miss D. Hartley, who has contributed so
largely to my work; indeed, I am sure that, without her talent, I should
receive but poor commendation from the general public.

All the sundials that figure in this work are dials that actually exist,
and although the settings are new, yet it is to be hoped that this will
in no wise detract from the value of the book. So many ancient dials are
to-day continually changing hands and being placed in new surroundings,
that although cognisant of the fact that it would be far more
interesting to illustrate my work with sketches showing the dial in its
original position, yet in the majority of cases I have proved this to be
impossible. I have, therefore, decided, whilst representing faithfully
the actual dials, to adopt quite new lines, and to illustrate my work
with a series of sketches in keeping with the age of each horologe, and
also to supplying a series of pictures calculated to suit the style and
nature of my book. Before referring to my poetical efforts, I will here
thank all those friends who have so kindly assisted me in my arduous
undertaking.

Principally, I am indebted to the kindness and generosity of Mr. Francis
Barker, of Clerkenwell, for his most valuable and interesting chapter
upon the setting of the sundial, and also for the loan of numerous
photographs and illustrations of various dials and gnomons. Mr. Barker’s
kindly help and interest has more than encouraged me in my undertaking,
and his wide and valuable knowledge on gnomonics is well known.

My most sincere thanks are also due to the following firms who have so
very kindly assisted me by permitting me to use in my book some
beautiful illustrations of sundials designed and made for existing and
future gardens:—Messrs. John P. White, Messrs. Pulham, Messrs. Joseph
Cheal & Son, Messrs. William Wood & Son, Messrs. Knowltons, Messrs. H.
W. Cashmore & Co.

It is not possible to mention the names of all those who have so kindly
assisted me in securing photographs of dials, or who have furnished me
from time to time with any required information; I will, therefore, but
express my great gratitude for every kindness, and venture to hope that
my book will meet with the approval of all.

If any reader finds it incumbent upon him to criticise adversely my
verses or mottoes, let me here plead a generous consideration. SIX
HUNDRED VERSES on one subject is a very big effort at any time, but how
much more so when each verse is intended of itself to be a separate
poem. Also, nearly all these verses have been written under the most
trying conditions—during the stress of arduous undertakings, and hours
devoid of comfort and surroundings congenial to a work of this
description.

If, then, any verse or verses appear to be weak, let the reader remember
that there has been no picking and choosing; for I have boldly published
all that I have written, well knowing that no two people see alike, and
that what may displease one may also find favour with another. Let,
then, those verses which do commend themselves to the reader be in his
or her eyes sufficient warranty for my book.

                                                             T. G. W. H.




                      The History of the Sundial.

                               CHAPTER I.


Who shall discover the age of the sundial, or fix with certainty the
year in which ye horologe was first invented to record the passing of
the day or perchance the hour? The archives of time will never reveal to
us the first dial that was invented to aid mortal man to regulate his
life and so fulfil his daily task. We can only at the best surmise what
the date may have been, and record existing information for the benefit
of posterity, trusting that new discoveries may throw fresh light upon
this most engrossing subject.

To the student of astronomy and mathematics, it will ever appear to be a
most natural event that the sundial should have been constructed to
record accurately the time of day; and such might doubtless express
surprise that the age of the earliest known horologe is not of greater
antiquity. But it must not be forgotten that the requirements of early
man were small, and time, although a most important consideration, was
not of the same value that it is to-day, in the highly civilised age in
which we live.

It is not my intention to give a long and detailed account of the
sundial, for I must confess that I am not sufficiently versed in its
chequered and varied history; but, nevertheless, I feel bound to include
in my book one or more chapters that shall supply a little information
upon the age, development, and construction of ye horologe.

But here I am at a loss to know where to start, for if I should deal
with the Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek, or Roman ages, doubtless I should
be ruled out of court, for a wise critic would question the lateness of
my starting point, and would prove conclusively that I ought to have
begun with Adam, who could not have missed the opportunity afforded him
of erecting a sundial in the Garden of Eden. Indeed, so hard is it to
fix a date for the earliest introduction of the sundial in its most
primitive form, that we can only allude with safety to its mention in
ancient writings and its discovery in various countries through
different ages.

Without doubt the Bible gives us the oldest records, and we may be sure
that wherever we get even the briefest allusion to the division of time,
we can assert the existence of a horologe with little hesitation.

Job (vii. 2) alludes to the monitor in the words—“as a servant earnestly
desireth the shadow,” and the miracle of the sundial of Ahaz has been
quoted and handed down for centuries.

Sundials exist in most countries in various forms, differing in
construction according to the knowledge of the age in astronomy and
mathematics, and showing clearly at different periods in the history of
a race the outside influence of the greater wisdom attained to by many
students in the art of horology.

If we devote considerable attention to the history of sundials we almost
unconsciously find ourselves dividing them into the following
groups:—Wall dials, pedestal dials, and portable dials. Without doubt it
will never be surely solved as to which is the older of the first two,
for who can ever know the resources of primitive man, the knowledge of
the ancients, or the earliest discoveries of the wandering tribes of the
East?

How little we really know of ancient China or Japan, where sundials
abound. When the history of the horologe of the West still remains
imperfect, who will determine that of the East? Let us solve the riddle
of Avebury or Stonehenge with certainty before we can decide the age of
any other likely form of horologe; let us move the sands of the desert
of Egypt and dig down into every ruin of the past before we can hope to
fix a date at which mortal man constructed a dial, mural or pedestal, to
record the passing of the day. Although priority in the age of the first
two groups of dials may remain an uncertainty, yet the third group of
portable dials can be safely given a late date.

By portable dials I would not have my readers include the tent pole
often used by wandering Arabs to cast a shadow, or the possible use of a
stone of any size by early man, but the host of small pocket and ring
dials made of metal, ivory, wood, or stone that are frequently found in
our own land, on the Continent, and in the East.

There is no more engrossing study than the age of the sundial, and to
those interested in gnomonics any fresh information or unrecorded
history is of the greatest importance. It is, however, left to the
excavator of buried cities and ancient ruins of the past to shed fresh
light upon such a well-worn subject, and the humble historian but
faithfully records and hands down to posterity the result of his
discoveries.

The minutes of to-day are as the hours of yesterday, and the necessity
of an accurate time-keeper is in this present century more keenly felt
than ever it was in the past. A glance at the sky to determine the
position of the sun in respect to well-known landmarks may have sufficed
the races of primitive man, but as generation succeeded generation, and
regular business occupations and more home life commenced, the
observance of stated intervals of the day must have become a necessity;
so that, if the old proverb be true, necessity became the mother of
invention, and in due course gave birth to the sundial, which, as time
went on, developed until it reached the perfect stage in which we find
it to-day.

Perhaps some day excavations in the Holy Land will reveal fresh forms of
horologe that will put into the shade the age of the present dials from
ancient Greece, but until then we have little data other than vague
allusions to them in the historical records of the past to go upon. It
is very doubtful whether ancient Egypt with all its vast learning and
resources will ever throw fresh light upon the subject of gnomonics.
Situated so close to the Equator, both the horizontal and vertical dials
would be of small service.

The angle of the gnomon being equal to the latitude of the place, the
few degrees either side of the Equator would necessitate such a small
elevation that a horizontal dial would be of little help. Again, a
vertical dial would show the time for only a very short portion of the
year, since the dial plate would have to be almost parallel with the
rays of the sun. Still, doubtless, records may yet be found that will
testify to its existence, if not in ancient Egypt, in lands that felt
Egyptian influence and benefited by their learning and wisdom.

Theories are problematical and surmises are often without foundation,
but I would indeed venture to think that it is more than possible that
the sundial played some part in the rectification of the Babylonian
calendar in 747 B.C., which took place about nineteen years before the
accession of King Ahaz, in whose reign it was clearly alluded to.

The oldest known dials at present are those of Grecian origin, and for
the most part are of the hemicyclean form invented by the Chaldean
Berosus, who lived about 340 B.C., and his particular shape and
construction of dial was in use for centuries. Four of these sundials
were discovered in Italy: one at Tivoli in 1746, another at Castel Nuovo
in 1751, another at Rignano in 1751, and the fourth at Pompeii in 1762.
It is thus evident that this form of sundial which was used by the
Arabians (who gave great study to gnomonics) was popular also amongst
the Romans. An interesting specimen of this form of horologe, which can
now be seen in the British Museum, was found at the base of Cleopatra’s
Needle in 1852. This dial is concave, and is made from a stone 16½
inches high by 17 inches wide, the depth of the bowl being 10 inches;
the hours marked are the twelve unequal hours by which the Greeks
divided up their day.

This dial—by no means satisfactory—doubtless owed much of its popularity
to its novel construction, and to the fact that it was more or less of a
portable nature. But the knowledge that it was constructed 360 years
after the known existence of the sundial (see Isaiah xxxviii. 8), leads
us to surmise that other forms of dials were in use at the same time. It
is a known fact that the ancients were familiar with declining dials,
and the Tower of the Winds at Athens, which still exists, has on its
walls, built in octagonal shape, no fewer than eight of this kind. And
although the date of these dials is evidently of a later period than the
actual building, they certainly belong to a very early time. However,
the Greeks were, as we know, well versed in the art of dialling, and
without doubt gave a lead in this study to other nations.

Herodotus, writing in 443 B.C., says that the Greeks acquired their
knowledge of the sundial from the Babylonians; the Roman writers in turn
give evidence of their acquisition of this instrument from the Greeks.
Although the Romans were backward in the science of gnomonics and slow
to adopt any particular form of horologe, they eventually constructed
many a beautiful dial of varied design. The first sundial was erected in
Rome in the year 290 B.C., this being taken from the Samnites by
Papirius Cursor. Another was brought to Rome by Valerius Messala from
Catania 261 B.C., but it was not until 164 B.C. that, as far as we know,
a dial constructed at Rome was set up by order of Q. Marcius Philippus.

Cicero, writing in 48 B.C. to Tiro, mentions that he wished to place a
sundial at his villa in Tusculum, and at a later date we see Romans
erecting sundials in every possible corner of their villas and grounds.

The first known dial in Britain, with the exception of the one or two
reputed Roman dials discovered in this country, are those of Saxon
origin found on some of our ancient churches. As far as we know nearly
all the earliest mural examples are semicircular, and although the
spaces into which the dial is divided vary considerably in number and
size, they seem to point to the practice of the early Norsemen dividing
time into tides. And since it is known that they apportioned the time
into eight tides, and that the oldest horologes have the fewest spaces,
it seems more than likely that many dials so marked owe their existence
to these hardy invaders.

Bede (our earliest historian) records the fact that the hours were
shorter or longer according to the seasons, and this testimony is borne
out by existing dials, generally found built into ancient buildings, on
the sides of porches, and the jambs of windows. I myself discovered one,
only two feet off the ground, built into the east side of an old Norman
south porch, and the fact that the dial had been cut in order to fit the
stone into its place—added to its position—showed very plainly that it
had been taken out of an earlier building and used again. Without
hazarding any date as to the earliest form of horologe in this country,
I would but testify from my own experience that many dials of early
workmanship actually exist unnoticed on many of our ancient buildings,
principally churches. A close and careful examination of the walls of
such would, I am sure, reveal many a time-worn horologe of the past.
Generally they are found on faced stones built into porches, windows,
and corners of buildings, and consist of circles and half-circles,
divided by lines which radiate from a hole in the centre to the
circumference. The number of lines differ considerably and the spaces
are also of unequal size.

Evidence tends to prove that these dials are of Saxon and Norman times,
and I venture to think from their divisions that in many cases, although
found on Norman buildings, they tend to show that Saxon ideas continued
to exist in many things in spite of Norman influence. It would take many
generations at that period of the history of our country to supplant in
remote districts a recognised form of dial, and although the Norman
method of recording time was more accurate, doubtless it was but
gradually adopted.

The Saxons used the simple dial so long in vogue amongst the hardy
Northmen or Vikings, who, being a maritime race, founded their divisions
of time on the ebb and flow of the tide. First, the four tides, two high
tides and two low; then, further improving this, they subdivided these
divisions again into halves and quarters, thus making the day and night
equal to sixteen hours. In this country there exist many of their dials,
and some are very noteworthy.

There is an ancient dial built upside down into the wall of the church
in the village of Byland in the Hambleton Hills, which is thought to
have been made by a Dane in the ninth century. It bears the
inscription:—

                    “SVMARLETHAN HVSCARL—ME FECIT.”
                   (Sumarlethi’s House Carl made me.)

Over the south door of Weaverthorpe Church, Yorkshire, there is a
similar dial, only it is divided into twelve parts, every alternate line
being crossed. It has an inscription:—

    “In Honore see Andreae Apostoli Herebertus Wintonie Hoc Monasterium
    Fecit in Tempore Regn——”

The unfinished name is thought to be that of Reginald II., to whom in
942 King Edmund stood godfather. A remarkably fine dial of about 1064
exists over the south door of the ancient church at Kirkdale, and bears
a long inscription, which, being translated, reads:—

    “Orm, Gamal’s son, bought S. Gregory’s Monastery when it was all
    utterly broken and fallen, and he let it to be made anew from the
    ground, to Christ and S. Gregory, in Edward’s day, the King; and in
    Tosti’s day, the Earl. This is the day’s sun-marker, at every tide,
    and Hawarth me made and Brand Provost.”

Another early dial exists over the church door at Bishopstone in Sussex.
It bears the inscription “Eadric,” and as a prince of the South Saxons
of this name lived A.D. 685, it is thought that this is its likely date.

It was whilst gazing at an ancient dial which I had discovered that the
following motto occurred to me:—

               “The age of this dial, who can compute it;
               So hazard no guess for man to refute it.”

Still, in spite of my couplet, I made notes in my book as to the
discovery of another Saxon horologe. Such is the nature of the keen
archæologist that he feels obliged to put dates to every find of
importance, although oft-times a more learned brother will dispel by
argument and proof very quickly his most sure convictions.

While attributing the early semicircular dial to the Saxons, evidence
strongly points to the fact that the many-rayed circular dials are of
the mediæval period. It will ever be very hard to determine the date of
many of these dials, as the age of a stone, cut and faced by the mason,
is an unknown quantity. And there is hardly a stone building in this
country that does not contain stone quarried from the demolished
buildings of the past. This being so, many a dial may now occupy a very
different position from that in which it was originally set.

As years moved on ye horologe was improved and immediately became more
popular. The time on the face of the dial was more divided, and from
being quite plain in appearance it gradually took a more ornate shape.

Sundials continued to be erected long after clocks came into use, and in
our land during the 17th century many very fine specimens were erected.
Doubtless royal patronage and interest had much to do with their
popularity, for we know that Charles I. took a keen interest in the art
of dialling, and himself caused a sundial to be set up in the Privy
Garden behind Whitehall, at Westminster. The beautiful dial at Holyrood
Castle, Scotland, is said to have been a gift to his Queen, Henrietta
Maria. When kings and princes set the fashion their subjects soon follow
suit, and thus we find that some of the most beautiful dials are of this
period.

Until watches began to be made in numbers the sundial ruled supreme;
clocks did not in any way diminish their popularity, and if the truth
were known doubtless only helped to cause a greater number to be
erected, since not only could they be relied upon to keep accurate time,
but also to serve for the setting of a clock when it had stopped. To-day
we introduce the sundial into our gardens more for an ornament than from
any wish to add to it a timekeeper, and it is the love of the antique
that causes old dials to change ownership and to be set up on new sites,
irrespective of the fact that they may have been constructed and set for
a different locality.

It is curious to note that although sundials have ever been in use,
since their discovery there seems to have existed from time to time what
I would like to call waves of popularity in the history of “ye
horologe.” Such are clearly marked by the many existing dials which
appertain to certain periods. If we could only get a census of dates, it
would be a matter of great interest to trace the state of the country at
the time of varying output, and to note the years of war and peace, of
prosperity and depression. I think it would be found that even as “ye
horologe” marks only _our_ sunny hours, so also the sunny hours of a
nation’s life has bade the sundial live.

The marked interest that has been taken in the sundial during recent
years shows it has still a great future before it. If, then, age can add
to its value, and yet in nowise impair its reliability, who will be
without such a garden ornament that gives also a gentle touch to what is
already a beautiful possession? Calling upon the thoughtful as it does
by many an apt line or verse to consider the brevity of time, it warns
and exhorts with far greater emphasis than the voice of man. Though only
of iron and stone, the work of men’s hands, it seems almost to gain our
sympathy, for given to one who has experienced the ravages of time, it
demonstrates the value of quiet endurance and resignation under trouble.

                              CHAPTER II.


The study of “ye horologe” is a most pleasing occupation and a most
engrossing science. So much so that when it has come before the special
notice of the great men of bygone ages, it has always effected some
lasting record of their interest, and oft-times improvement, in the
construction of what was a most necessary acquisition for every
establishment.

Shakespeare, in his Richard II. (act v. scene 5), makes King Richard,
who was incarcerated in a dungeon in Pomfret Castle, give utterance to
the following words:—

           “I wasted time, and now doth time waste me.
           Or now hath time made me his numb’ring clock:
           My thoughts are minutes; and, with sighs, they jar
           Their watches on to mine eyes, the outward watch,
           Whereto my finger, like a dial’s point,
           Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.”

In Henry VI. Shakespeare again takes notice of the sundial:—

              “Methinks it were a happy life
              To carve out dials quaintly point by point.”

He also alludes to them in some of his other plays. Mentioned by many
famous men in various ways they are dealt with directly by not a few.

So important did the study of gnomonics become that it was at one time
considered to be a most necessary part of a student’s education. Sir
Christopher Wren was well versed in the art of dialling in his boyhood,
and as a boy Sir Isaac Newton made a sundial which he painted upon the
ceiling of his room; he also carved two dials upon the south end of the
Manor House at Woolsthorpe, in the parish of Colterworth, where he was
born. So numerous are the instances of famous men making or ordering
sundials to be made, that it would be impossible to mention even a
representative number of names.

A beautiful sundial was erected at Abbotsford by Sir Walter Scott, and
all over the country are found dials of various ages and designs, built
by the orders of great and learned men, to be a guide and also a
memorial through years to come. It was Charles Dickens who, in June,
1859, wrote to his daughter and signified his pleasure at receiving from
the contractor for the works, the gift of a balustrade out of the old
Rochester bridge; he stated that without delay he had had a dial
constructed to suit the pedestal, and thus had added to his garden a
fresh item of interest.

All forms of dials have received consideration—perpendicular,
horizontal, pocket and ring dials; even moon dials have not been
neglected.

Thomas Fale, in his book on “The Art of Dialling,” published in 1593,
gives a chapter to “the making of a dial, to know the houre by the
moon;”—while it is certain that portable cylinder dials were in common
use in England as early as the middle of the fifteenth century.

Lydgate, who wrote, about the year 1430, the “storie of Thebes, an
additional Canterbury tale,” which was printed with Chaucer’s works in
1651, writes as if a dial were commonly carried by travellers. He says:—

              “Passed ye thrope of Boughton on the Blee:
              By my kalendar I gan anon to see
              Through the sonne that full clear gan shine,
              Of the clock that it drew to nine.”

And Warton gives us a note on the word “kalendar.”

“Chilindre, a cylinder, a kind of pocket sundial.” Many pocket dials of
great beauty, dating from the middle of the 17th century, are in
existence, and, although rare; ivory, silver, brass, and bone dials of
the Stuart period can still be secured from dealers for reasonable sums.
But, like most rarities, they will doubtless soon be bought up and find
their way into museums or the collections of the rich.

How early a date may be fixed for the pocket dial in England cannot be
determined. Nicholas Kratzer, styled the Deviser of Horologies to King
Henry VIII. of England, certainly left us pocket dials of his age, for
in Cardinal Wolsey’s dial made by him we have a fair specimen of his
art. Sixteenth-century pocket dials were made in France, Germany, and
Italy, and although they were of different shapes and sizes, the general
construction of “ye horologe” was the same. In the British Museum, which
is nowhere equalled as a public collection, can be seen a great number
of portable dials.

Large private collections also exist in this country and on the
continent, containing many rare and extremely valuable specimens. It
seems only natural that pocket dials should be popular, and when all
things are considered, it is a matter of considerable surprise that more
do not exist. To-day, even a schoolboy has his watch, and there is
hardly a man who fails to feel his loss when without this indispensable
article, but it must be remembered that we are far more exacting as
regards time than we used to be, and the closer observance of minutes
and seconds demands a portable timekeeper that is not dependent upon the
sun, which is so often hidden from our view. It has been recorded that
George Washington was in the habit of carrying a pocket dial in the
place of a watch; nor does he stand alone in respect to this preference
for a pocket horologe, as many great men have delighted to indulge in
this particular fancy.

An ancient custom, which is still in vogue at a few of our parish
churches, is the ringing of a bell in the morning, at noon, and at
curfew to proclaim the time of day. This has now nearly died out, and
the curfew bell is in most places all that is left of a time-honoured
method of telling the divisions of the day.

What? we might naturally ask, set the hour and fixed the time? Without
doubt the ancient sundial, invariably found on all old churches, or
which might have been carried by the clergyman or clerk in pocket form.
We can imagine how unpunctual people must have been on days that were
dull, and how very differently business matters must have been conducted
in years that are gone from what they are in our own age.

Whatever part the sundial has to play in the future history of
individuals and nations, it must never be forgotten that as a faithful
recorder of the passing hour—under certain conditions—it remains for
ever the most accurate timekeeper that has been discovered by mortal
man.

Great minds have loved to dwell upon its study, and noble men have
handed down to generations that were to come specimens of the
craftsman’s art and the scientist’s discoveries. In our own land exist
many historical dials fashioned to satisfy the fancies of individuals,
and also for the benefit of the public. It is a most noticeable fact
that the majority of sundials attributable to great men have nearly
always a motto or verse inscribed upon them.

From the earliest ages, when “ye horologe” was a popular means of
recording the time of day, “a sundial motto” was considered to be a
necessary part of a well-ordered horologe. Most of the more elaborately
constructed dials possess a motto or inscription of some kind or other,
and not a few have a verse or verses of the most searching and
awe-inspiring nature. Generally speaking, however, the vast majority of
sundial mottoes and verses, are of an inferior standard, and quite
unworthy of the supreme beauty and great wisdom inculcated by this
silent monitor.

For the most part the tendency of the varying ages has been to keep to
the Latin tongue, in which, with scholarly dictum, the average artificer
has in very deed expressed, “Multum in Parvo,” what a humble mind,
unversed in that language, “not easily understanded by ye people,” would
rather have read at greater length in his own mother tongue. Latin
mottoes abound everywhere; generally some pretty conceit of the
unscholarly, but often, too, the genuine relics of an ecclesiastical
influence in matters of education. A careful review of the large number
of mottoes and verses that are known, would, as one might very naturally
expect, show that the great majority were of a religious kind. But the
paucity of ideas they display is painfully evident; being as a rule of a
lugubrious nature they are hardly ever far removed from the most
self-evident facts; and such awe-inspiring words as “Prepare to die,”
“Consider your latter end,” “Beware of the last hour,” “I shall return
but never thou,” do not convey aught of the sunny, sympathetic,
instructive and lovable characteristics that the sundial has to give.
Here and there the thoughts of great minds, aptly expressed to suit the
dial’s power, stand out as red-letter days in a church’s calendar and
proclaim by their individuality an exceptional character. But such
verses are very rare, and where they exist they will generally be found
on dials that have been erected by the order of the writer of the verse
to mark some special occasion.

Verses on sundials are comparatively scarce compared with short mottoes;
and this is surprisingly strange, considering what I would like to term
the poetry of “ye horologe,” for there is hardly anything on this earth
that is better calculated to call forth from man the very finest
expressions relative to our brief life, than the sundial. This important
point in the history of the sundial is hard to account for, unless it be
that the majority of dials were made for chance owners, turned out, in
fact, like the clocks of the present day, only in a lesser degree, and
being actually finished when their destination was known. In this case
there would often be hardly room for a lengthy verse or verses.
Possibly, too, in an economic age, the extra cost was a bar to such;
anyway, the fact remains that verses are seldom found. But, be it verse
or motto, one thing is most noticeable—namely, that nearly every one
gives force by potent words to some weighty, though time-worn idea, and
they teach frail mortal man to moralise and dwell on a subject that he
too readily thrusts from him—the brevity of life.

I should weary the reader if I were to attempt to record at all fully a
fair variety of the mottoes that exist. Indeed, to do justice to such a
subject, it would be necessary to give a very full list collected from
the different lands that have in various ways influenced our own in
matters of learning. This not being possible, I will but quote a few of
those mottoes and verses that have appealed to me as the best of their
class, and, with some short comment, pass on to other items of interest.

What more appropriate or suitable motto could be chosen, than the three
words, “Lead kindly light,” taken from Cardinal Newman’s beautiful hymn.
They are full of power and trustfulness, and, if placed on a dial in the
view of many, would be answerable for innumerable good deeds and noble
resolutions. Again, note the motto—_Cosi la vita_, “Such is Life,” on a
dial at Albizzola. This is of far greater force than “Prepare to die.”
We do not intend to die if we can help it, we intend to live! and so we
put the motto “Prepare to die” from our mind as crude and unfeeling. But
not so the former; it appeals to us, and the imperceptible moving shadow
on the dial’s face that soon will be gone gives with the motto a gentle
lesson that is considered by all.

There are longer mottoes of this class that give useful lessons, and are
of a kind well calculated to do good, such as _Sic transit gloria
mundi_, “Thus passeth the glory of the world;” and _Hora est Orandi_,
“It is the hour for prayer;” and that fine selection from Scripture for
a dial, “I also am under authority.” Such verses are good at all times
and in all places, and are very far removed from those that seem to
contain only the darkest of outlooks and naught of the sunny prospects
of life. There is another style or class of motto or verse that has a
witty vein, and which is by no means uncommon. The following are
amusing:—

                “What is the time? come, why do you ask?
                Is it to start, or to end your task?”

                  *       *       *       *       *

                “Wait a moment never say
                When hours you mean, or chance the day.”

                  *       *       *       *       *

          “I live in the present, a past I recall,
          But my future depends on the strength of this wall.”

                  *       *       *       *       *

                       “Since I never lose
                       A fresh excuse go choose.”

                  *       *       *       *       *

                  “Time was made for slaves, men say;
                  Yet free-men ask the time of day.”

A verse, written by Andrew Marvell in the reign of Charles II., called
forth by a drunken nobleman of the Court defacing the beautiful sundial
erected by Stone in the Privy Garden at Whitehall, in 1662, is of
interest:-

           “For a dial the place is too unsecure,
             Since the Privy Garden could not it defend;
           And so near to the Court they will never endure
             Any monument how they their time may misspend.”

There is a quaint and humorous legend given in “Notes and Queries” (2nd
S, v. ix., p. 279), concerning the motto “Begone about your business,”
placed over a dial at the east end of the Inner Temple terrace, that
makes very good reading. “When the dial was put up, the artist inquired
whether he should (as was customary) paint a motto under it. The
Benchers assented, and appointed him to call at the library on a certain
day and hour, at which time they would have agreed upon a motto. It
appears, however, that they had totally forgotten this; and when the
artist or his messenger called at the library at the time appointed, he
found no one but a cross-looking old gentleman poring over some musty
book. ‘Please, sir, I am come for the motto for the sundial.’ ‘What do
you want?’ was the pettish answer; ‘why do you disturb me?’ ‘Please,
sir, the gentleman told me I was to call at this hour for a motto for
the sundial.’ ‘Begone about your business,’ was the testy reply. The
man, either by design or mistake, chose to take this as an answer to his
inquiry, and accordingly painted in large letters under the dial,
‘Begone about your business.’ The Benchers when they saw it, decided
that it was very appropriate, and that they would let it stand—chance
having done their work for them as well as they could have done it for
themselves.”

Besides mottoes and verses that are of a serious or humorous nature,
there exists many that express in well-chosen words happy ideas of the
present or the past, such as the following:—

                  “Let not thoughts of time depress
                  A heart that owes but thankfulness.”

                  *       *       *       *       *

                “Some men delight to weigh the showers,
                But few attempt to weigh the hours.”

                  *       *       *       *       *

                    “Like the flowers, ever try
                    To catch the sun e’er it go by.”

                  *       *       *       *       *

                   “Believe me, mortals, when I say,
                   The past is what we make to-day.”

It is, however, a very difficult matter to trace the age of mottoes, and
the dial by no means is necessarily of the same date.

Even from the 16th century onwards we find suitable mottoes engraved on
sundial plates, which called upon the visitor to moralise or dwell upon
the passing beauties of creation. These verses give us an insight into
the home life and secret feelings of many a great mind otherwise silent
on matters concerning the more human side of life. Herein lies the great
charm of the sundial; it stands oft-times at the cross paths of a garden
demanding a passing look, and it bids us stop and think of those things
which we are apt to forget.

Surrounded by all that most appeals to the human mind—transitory gems of
the garden—the sundial exercises a subtle charm and exerts a soft and
more kindly influence which is felt in after life. So much could be said
on the so-called poetry of the sundial that I hasten to control my pen
and deal with a more important item concerning its value.

As an ornament it is the greatest acquisition that any garden can
possess. As a time-keeper, if constructed for the locality and carefully
set, it is beyond compare; and like the flowers themselves it will to
the end of time remain one of the finest monitors that reasoning man can
follow. It is therefore a matter of great surprise that many sundials
should have for so long a period fallen into disuse and decay. But we
live in an age of bustle and excitement, and it is seldom that any day
gives an hour of rest and mental relaxation from the worries that kill.
But when that hour does come, and we find ourselves at peace in our
gardens, far from the maddening crowd, studying the beauties of nature,
our gaze is certain to be centred sooner or later upon the sundial, our
best companion in that quiet hour; and the few moments we spend in
silent contemplation before it, will strengthen us for the bustle and
trials of an exacting life.

                      The Setting of the Sundial.

                              CHAPTER III.


The sundial is an interesting device for indicating the solar time of
the place, or places other than where fixed. Its construction is founded
upon the astronomical theory of the sun’s apparent motion; and from
these its rules and operations have been deduced by the aid of geometry
and trigonometry.

The sundial, at the present time, is made in many forms, the one usually
met with being the horizontal form seen on a pedestal in many gardens.
The next is the vertical dial to be seen on many old churches and
houses. There are also a number of others, such as the hemispherical,
cruciform, cylindrical, polygonal, armillary sphere—commonly known as
the “globe”—reclining, inclining, and a great variety of pocket dials.

=THE HORIZONTAL GARDEN DIAL= consists usually of a circular metal plate,
divided into five-minute spaces, the hours, compass points, ornamental
star, border and motto nicely engraved by hand, and a metal gnomon for
casting the shadow to indicate the time of day. The larger dials, from
15 ins. in diameter, are divided to single minutes, but this is not
always advisable, especially in low latitudes, as the minute divisions
come too close together between the hours of 10 o’clock and 12 o’clock,
and from 12 o’clock until 2 o’clock, so that the lines appear almost as
one. When making a sundial of this description it is necessary for the
maker to know the latitude, or name of the place where the dial is going
to be fixed.

=THE VERTICAL SUNDIAL=, which in construction is similar to a horizontal
dial, is for placing in an upright position, such as on the wall of a
church or house, or one of the side faces of a tall upright pillar. It
should be made for, and fixed on, a wall having a southerly aspect, so
as to receive as much sun as possible.

Before constructing a vertical dial it is necessary for the maker to
know the declination or true aspect of the wall, expressed in degrees,
in addition to the latitude of the place. These figures must be
absolutely correct, for the whole accuracy of the dial depends upon the
figures given. The makers prefer to ascertain the declination
themselves, for they alone then hold themselves responsible for the dial
to indicate correct _solar_ time.

There are many ways of measuring the length of a day in use in this
country (the British Isles), but not one of them is perfect as a system
for universal daily use. The three chief kinds of time used in this
country are Greenwich mean time, Solar, or apparent time, and Sidereal,
or star time; this latter is the only exact time and is used by
astronomers alone. The time varies by several minutes between each of
the methods mentioned.

The difference between sundial time and clock time is due partly to the
irregular motion of the earth travelling in its path round the sun.
Sometimes it travels faster and sometimes slower. It is also due partly
to the fact that the time shown by our clocks and watches, called
_Greenwich mean time_, is purely artificial and imaginary, not agreeing
with any natural time at all, nevertheless for commercial purposes, it
answers very well.

The sun crosses the meridian at Greenwich at 12 by the clock upon only
four days in the year; on all other days it is either before or after
the clock, the difference varying from a few seconds up to as much as a
little over 16 minutes.

On looking at the map of England it will be seen that from the extreme
east coast (Lowestoft) to the extreme west coast (Land’s End) the
country extends from Greenwich 1° 45′ on the East 5° 40′ 25″ on the
West. Now, as the sun appears to travel from an easterly to a westerly
direction each day, and takes four minutes to travel over one degree of
longitude, it can be seen that it will take about 30 minutes to travel
across the whole country, and the time of all places east of Greenwich
is fast, whilst at others west the time is slow. For example, supposing
a sundial in position at each of the following places, Lowestoft,
Greenwich, and Land’s End, and it was noon at Lowestoft by the sundial,
the time indicated at the moment by each dial would be as follows:
Lowestoft, 12 o’clock; Greenwich, 7 minutes to 12; Land’s End, about 22¾
minutes to 12. But our watches would have given the time as 12 o’clock
at all places at the same moment, so we see that something is required
in the way of a table calculated for every day of the year, giving the
variations daily between the sundial and the watch.

The following table, called an “Equation Table,” gives the difference in
minutes, and you will notice that the sundial and clock both agree on
four occasions during the year: 15th April, 14th June, 1st September,
25th December.

                             EQUATION TABLE.

 FAST MEANS THAT THE WATCH SHOULD BE FASTER THAN THE DIAL. SLOW, SLOWER.

The sundial, as already mentioned, shows _solar_ time, but by adding or
deducting the differences, as shown above, _local mean time_ is found,
and by again adding or deducting the difference of longitude, _Greenwich
mean time_ is the result. For instance, a sundial at Wrexham (3° West
longitude) on the 11th March indicates 11 o’clock, and we want to find
Greenwich mean time. We proceed as follows:—

                                                 H. M.
                  Wrexham Sundial                11  0
                  Difference of Equation, _add_   0 10
                                                 —— ——
                  Local Mean Time                11 10
                  Difference of Longitude, _add_  0 12
                                                 —— ——
                  Greenwich Mean Time            11 22
                                                 —— ——

We see by the above, that the watch should be 22 minutes faster than the
dial.

A well-made sundial should have engraved upon it an equation table and
the longitude of the place where it is fixed, and the consequent
allowance of time to be added or subtracted to find _Greenwich mean
time_.

=SUNDIALS SHOULD BE FIXED= on a bright, sunny day, a horizontal dial
being fixed as follows:—First see that the stone pedestal on which the
dial is to be fixed is perfectly rigid, also flat and level on top.
Remove with a pair of pinchers or plyers the three button-headed studs
that are usually fitted on the back of the dial, then place the dial
approximately in position by moving it about until the shadows show the
time within a few minutes, and with a pencil, mark the positions of the
studs on the stone through the holes in the plate. Remove the dial and
replace the studs in the dial; cut the three holes about twice as large
as the heads, so that the dial has plenty of play to the right and left
to facilitate final adjustment. Mix with water a little Portland cement,
which is known as “grouting,” damp the holes in the stone and pour the
grouting in and place the dial in its place, turning it until it shows
correct _solar time_ of the place, taking care that the plate is level,
and then allow the cement to set. The dial is now fixed, and requires no
further refixing at any time.

To ascertain correct _solar time_ for fixing purposes proceed as in the
example given here, and for the purpose we will take Andover (1½° West)
as the place where the dial is about to be fixed on 1st October.

                                                  H. M.
                Greenwich Mean Time               10 30
                Difference of Longitude, _deduct_  0  6
                                                  —— ——
                Local Mean Time                   10 24
                Difference of Equation, _add_      0 10
                                                  —— ——
                Andover Solar Time                10 34
                                                  —— ——

So we see that on 1st October the dial must be fixed 4 minutes faster
than the watch.

The gnomon of a horizontal sundial is always fixed on the XII. o’clock
line, which represents the _true_ north and south meridian, and its edge
is elevated above the plane to an angle equal to the latitude of the
place. In the northern hemisphere XII. o’clock and the elevated end of
the gnomon are always placed towards the north, but in the southern
hemisphere the elevated end and XII. o’clock are placed facing the
south.

In northern latitudes the sun is always _due south_ at XII. o’clock by
the sundial throughout the year, and in southern latitudes it is always
_due north_ at XII. In both hemispheres the sun is always due east at
VI. a.m. and due west at VI. p.m.

Sundials can be fixed in dull weather, but a magnetic compass will then
have to be employed; and although the fixing is simpler than when the
sun is used the result is not so accurate.

The directions are as given here:—

Remove the studs and place the dial on the pedestal; take the compass,
which should have a square box with needle, and lay it on the dial plate
with the east or west side of the box close against the gnomon, and
allow the needle to settle. Then, knowing the “magnetic variation” of
the spot—for example, we will take London, which is 16° west of the
_true north_—turn the sundial until the north end of the needle
coincides with the 16° division west of the N. of compass dial. Take a
pencil and mark the holes for studs; cut the holes and fill with
grouting; place the dial on the pedestal and finally adjust with the
compass before the cement sets.

Sundials can be fixed by the compass, and by the sun, providing the sun
is shining on the dial, at any time during the day. To read the time
shown by a horizontal sundial, stand facing the sun, and for the morning
hours take the right hand edge of the shadow, and for the afternoon
hours take the left hand edge.

Sundials of good make have the hour-lines and other divisions radiating
from two centres, which are at a distance apart equal to the thickness
of the gnomon, consequently there appears to be two hour lines at XII.
o’clock, but really it is one, as the shadow at noon fills the space
between the two lines.

A sundial cannot be said to be complete without a motto of some
description, and by inscribing one on the dial or pedestal it gives a
fitting voice to the dignified dial.

                                   I.

           O that the gentle Muse would stir my brain,
             And give expressive words for me to pen.
           Would put in verse great thoughts born to remain,
             A wondrous poem prized by Englishmen.


                                  II.

           O that before I leave this frail abode,
             And talents granted me have passed to clay,
           Would that I, too, could claim that I’d bestowed,
             Like poets great, a work that lives for aye.

                               REMEMBER.


                 In your sunny hours remember
                   Summer days soon come and go;
                 And a mournful, sad November
                   All too soon this truth will show.

                 In your darkest hours remember,
                   Every cloud is silver lined,
                 And though life’s oft like December,
                   Still there lurks the Spring behind.




                              THE SUNDIAL.


             When the shadow is on the sundial
               Above the dear old garden door,
             And summer days once more now smile,
               As they so often have before.

             When morning light transforms to noon,
               And noon to the closing day,
             And brightest hours have passed so soon
               That we all would have wished to stay.

             When life has reached its eventide,
               And each ray is from the west,
             And sunbeams to the dial confide
               That the hour they’ve marked calls rest;

             Then I wander midst the flowers
               Until the gloaming ends the day,
             And the dew has soaked, like showers
               Which descend in glorious May.

             I pause before the door awhile,
               Watch the glimmering light depart,
             Note that darkness hides the sundial,
               Although great peace has filled my heart.

                                               T. G. W. H.

                                CHANGE.


                    Learn a lesson from this dial,
                      Dwell not on the past;
                    Greet the present with a smile,
                      For future cannot last.

                    To-morrow soon becomes to-day,
                      The present falls behind,
                    And as each moment glides away
                      My maxim comes to mind.




                           THE DIAL’S MOTTO.


                                  I.

            A butterfly to a dial exclaimed,
              “How short is the period of sun!
            And how few are the cheering hours of light
              Before brightness of day is done!”


                                 II.

            “Oh! if only the sun would always shine,
              And its greatest power maintain,
            No reason to grumble then could be mine,
              And no wish to ever complain.”


                                III.

            A moth by chance overheard the remark,
              And answered, “I’d have you to know
            I hate the day and I long for the dark,
              And _I_ wish that all hours were so.”


                                 IV.

            “I delight in the cooling breath of night,
              And I long for the close of day;
            I wish I could shorten the hours of light,
              And then hasten each sunset ray.”


                                  V.

            They both gazed in turn at the sundial bold,
              And each read in motto God’s plan:
            “I created the light and dark of old,
            Proportioned for all that this world should hold
              From the insect that flies to man.”

                                                T. G. W. H.

[Illustration]




                               ETERNITY.


               We mention time, then heave a sigh,
               There’s not enough, we all, all cry;
               Too soon, too soon’s eternity.

               Ah, fellow mortals, let me say,
               ’Tis you who have made time’s little day.
               We are all, all in eternity.




                        THE MAID AND THE SUNDIAL


                                I.

            A maiden glanced at a sundial old,
              For to learn both the time of the day
            And to read its motto written bold,
              Made so clear by each sun-lightened ray.


                               II.

            Beauty, it said, is a thing of naught,
              And true love, like the sun, sinks ever;
            For the joys that please can all be bought,
              Time only shall last on for ever.


                              III.

            The maiden laughed as she read this rhyme,
              And exclaimed, “But man could compose it
            Who had loved and lost, upon a time,
              And so now on a stone he shows it.”


                               IV.

            “Beauty,” she said, “is a thing to hold,
              Both women and men they adore it.
            Love is eternal, far above gold,
              Mark well how the world doth implore it.”


                                V.

            “Money that buys some beautiful thing,
              And which gives what is called love a place,
            Ends with the bell, the gift of a ring,
              Will not change the rich purchaser’s face.”


                               VI.

            “Love, like the sun, may sink down to rest,
              But daily the heavens renew it;
            So learn of all gifts love is the best—
              Go win, and not buy, lest you rue it.”

                                                T. G. W. H.

[Illustration]




                                UTILITY.


              He who fashioned me for ornament and use,
                To please the eye and to impart the time,
              Foreshadowed, too, a possible disuse,
                And fearing this inscribed on me a rhyme.

                    Though forgotten for a season,
                      Since I mark but hours of sun;
                    Still, I’ve value for this reason—
                      I lend grace for years to come.




                         THE MOON AND THE DIAL.


                                  I.

              The moon peeped out on a cloudy night,
                And shone on an old stone wall;
              It lit up the face of the dial bright
                That stood to the view of all.


                                 II.

              A traveller blessed its silvery beams
                That guided him on his way,
              And called with laughter, Faith, it seems
                You’re worth all the light of day!


                                III.

              His eye detected the sundial’s rhyme,
                And he read the writing clear:
              I work for the sun alone through time,
                For his light rules only here.


                                 IV.

              Continue your work, the traveller said;
                But, still, I would have you know
              That working for moon when sun has fled
                A greater power would show.


                                  V.

              He who made your dial and penned yon verse
                Could never to sea have been,
              Or felt the force of a sailor’s curse
                When no star or moon were seen.


                                 VI.

              He could not have heard the blessings given
                On a sky as bright as day,
              Or known beside sun’s light in heaven
                The value of moonshine ray.


                                VII.

              Doubtless he was not able to plan
                A dial to do for two;
              But surely the most untutored man
                A better verse could do.

                                              T. G. W. H.

                    Lord of light and dark we pray,
                    Guide us to the end of day,

                      Must take things as they be.

                  Men worry ’til ’tis light;
                    Then ’til it is dark;
                  They worry through the hours bright,
                  Forgetting how soon lost to sight,
                    Is time, that leaves its mark.

                Men grumble at the sun,
                  And also at the rain;
                They grumble whilst the hours each one,
                Speed on and show by minutes none,
                  True cause why they complain.

           The Saxons divided time into tides,
             The Normans for hours found place;
           But the English with minutes and seconds besides,
           Added more lines than my dial divides,
             And now fractions I’m likely to grace.

         Defeated the tortoise and outran the hare,

                 The ocean is likened to time,
                   Because of its boundless expanse;
                 But men who have sailed to each clime,
                   Discredit such talk as romance.

                Each moment finds the past increased,
                  So swiftly Time moves on;
                The bells for Matins scarce have ceased,
                  Ere it is Evensong.

               ’Tis man alone divides the day,
                 Observing hours called Time,
               But birds and beasts the sun’s bright ray
                 With care in every clime.

                     Ever keep a smiling face,
                       Finding mirth some room;
                     Hours and minutes flow apace,
                       Life’s too short for gloom.

                     Our life is like a chain,
                       Made up of hours now passed,
                     Yet only those remain
                       Fashioned for such to last.

                   I number none but cloudless hours,
                     So through the years to be,
                   May the King of heavenly powers
                     Reckon bright hours to thee.

                   Whereso’er your treasure lies,
                   There will be your greatest ties;
                   Ever, then, your riches send,
                   Forward to your journey’s end.

                  “All’s well that ends well”,
                    Bear this fact in mind.
                  Start at the end then you can tell,
                    That all your hours were kind.

                 Traveller, note this hour that I mark,
                   It shall never return;
                 Though hours I register after dark,
                   Count not from these to learn.

                      Nothing is certain,
                        Not even the hour,
                      For clouds like a curtain,
                        Restrict the sun’s power.

                     Go, reckon my hour,
                       Then note time of day;
                     But remember I’ve power,
                       To mark thine the same way.

                        Love’s like ye tide,

                  God’s light and love reflect in me.

             Insure against the ravages of time,
               Provide some years of rest for thy old age;
             Go, make good use of days while in your prime,
               The Sun gives chances to enrich life’s page.

           Rise up with the birds, go to bed with the same,
           And at the sundial you will never complain.
           But if time you’d know in the midst of the night,
           Then mark each cock-crow before it is light.

                    Why time is likened to a wheel,
                      The reason I don’t know,
                    For only dials are truly leal,
                      A clock may cease to go.

                   I note the hours of every day,
                     From early morn ’till dark;
                   Then all my work the hours repay,
                     And leave on me their mark.

                  While there is life there is hope,
                    And with all are minutes to spare;
                  Strive, then, with trials to cope;
                    Look happy, and banish all care.

               The ancients regarded the face of the sky
                 To determine the time of day;
               But moderns, economy anxious to ply,
                 A watch or a dial obey.

                 Let time be likened to a bridge,
                   Each stage of life a span,
                 Which crowns the piers that do support
                   In crossing every man.

               Watches and clocks can never agree,

               Give up the lot and make use of me,
                 For of change I’ve never a notion.

               All circular things were made to go,
               With smallest friction, I’d have you know;
               Thus with the time no trouble is found,
               Since ever it moves so steadily round.

           It is well written in that book of gold,

           And not expect their sons to earn them more.

             Still love divine prevails, with rest for all.

                   We leave of earth one ridge,
                     Then cross to earth for ever.

                  Men cannot simply happy be,
                  Through having of mere property,
                  For joys come not from what we own,
                  But wealth of character alone.

            The sun each day scarce rises in its might

            So, as a child, we scarce the light have seen,

                      Whilst we’ve life and power,
                        Let us cease from worry.

  ORIGINAL SKETCH FOR A LEAP YEAR DIAL.
]

                   Listen to my simple rhyme,
                   Telling hapless maids the time,
                   How each February three years fled
                   Women all may ask to wed.




                           ADDITIONAL VERSES.


          We cling to life for fear that we,
          When life is gone should cease to be.

          When the shadows flee away,
          God give thee rest ’til break of day.

          Without a pencil or a pen,
          I trace the hours of light for men.

          He only can be called a friend,
          Who keeps the same unto the end.

          The greatest maxim I can give,
          Is make the most of hours you live.

          I fear for thee, lest all hours given,
          Pave not a road that leads to Heaven.

          O blame not time if thou art poor,
          For who knows what it holds in store.

          Fresh hours and troubles never greet,
          Ere you have spent these moments sweet.

          Second by second each hour is paid,
          And little by little fortunes are made.

          Life is a wind, a shadow, and dust,
          Man is a mortal and perish he must.

          Two forces man may not deride,
          The flight of time and strength of tide.

          First recognize that life is short.
          Then live each day as all men ought.

          God through the senses gives to all,
          Proofs of time’s flight men may recall.

          None so blind as those who will not see,
          Remember this when next you look at me.

          Hours there are most men would recall,
          But few of us ask the return of them all.

          O never fear an hour of loss,
          That takes its shadow from the cross.

          Passenger, follow my flight and know,
          A journey like me you soon must go.

          Live, O live, to all I cry,
          Live, remembering ye must die.

          Just like the clouds I too drift by,
          Formed and reformed incessantly.

          Mortal, ever strive to learn,
          Thou art from dust, and must return.

          Through the hours of life men should,
          Learn to take bad with the good.

          Since life’s as short as all men say,
          Mortal, do not waste a day.

          Early to bed and early to rise,
          Sees the sun set and lighten the skies.

          A good-bye never, mortals, say,
          Since we must meet another day.

          Ere thy sunny hours do cease,
          Patience learn and be at peace.

          Remember whilst you have your prime,
          To get good value for your time.

          Note ye blessings that I bring,
          Ere these fleeting hours take wing.

          Since no man e’er can live for naught,
          See that you live e’en as you ought.

          Hour by hour I yearly strive,
          To show to men this dial’s alive.

          If life’s chances you ignore,
          Blame but yourself when you are poor.

          O haste before the end of day
          Impedes your work or stops your play.

          O happy land rejoice and sing,
          God bless the day, long live the King.

          Have patience like me, and never complain,
          When asked the same question again and again.

          Our life’s a bubble, hold it who can,
          For it goes with the wind, like the breath of man.

          Troubles, what are they? Clouds that must come,
          Blessings disguised, experience the sum.

          O strive each man like new mown hay,
          To hold those gifts that pass away.

          I live in the present, a past I recall,
          But my future depends on the strength of this wall.

          Haste, O haste, for ’twill soon be to-morrow,
          And hours that we waste bring days of sorrow.

          Good fortune, like these hours, will soon be past,
          So make the most of such while it doth last.

          He who made the sun, made too the shade,
          Let not life’s shadows anyone hide Him who made.

          Since He who gives can also take away,
          Let every man who lives go watch and pray.

          Within the sight of all I hourly stand,
          To praise, reproach, and teach throughout the land.

          Go, take your time is truly said,
          For we when gone are a long while dead.

          Let thy thoughts now dwell on the present you see,
          Not a past or a future continually.

          Year in, year out, silent the hours of day I tell,
          Nor vex like noisy clock or loudly chiming bell.

          Hours misspent I’d liken to weeds,
          With minutes for roots and seconds for seeds.

          He who starts each day with doubts or fears,
          Seldom smiles and is full of tears.

          A circle, a gnomon, a shadow, a look,
          Are worth more to men than the leaves of a book.

          Time tests our friends, and soon doth teach
          The value of their love and speech.

          Frail mortal, tell me, who hath power
          To stop ye tide or check ye hour?

          He is thrice wise, and he thrice blessed,
          Who portions out work, play, and rest.

          Though clouds may dull both hour and day,
          Love like the sun endures for aye.

          Time tests our friends and soon doth show
          Which is the friend and which the foe.

          Death can never lose its sting,
          Whilst we fear time on the wing.

          I live an example to man and youth,
          Of patient consistence, brightness, and truth.

          He who waits for something to turn up,
          Fills not the platter nor yet the cup.

          The sun, the source of heat and light,
          Gives flowers their scent and colour bright.

          They the thread of life entangle,
          Who guilty are of endless wrangle.

          What’s the time? Come, why do you ask?
          Is it to start or end your task?

          The thread of life, though thick and strong,
          Fates shall sever for thee ere long.

          Who goes early to bed and early to rise,
          Needs naught but the sun to lighten the skies.

          Go, live and let live while you’ve power,
          For life is but a thing of hour.

          What we sow in time we reap in Eternity,
          Seek help then Divine, Christian fraternity.

          No man may ever my hours deride,
          Who has lost by such, train, horse, or tide.

          The age of this dial, who can compute it?
          So hazard no guess for men to refute it.

          Work so hard to-day that you
          Will find the morrow with less to do.

          Like the print of feet on the sand or snow,
          This shadow reveals where the sun doth go.

          Remember, an old age shall tell,
          Of hours misspent and hours lived well.

          If for you this hour prove late,
          Do not hesitate or wait.

          The most important thing on earth
          Is of time to learn the worth.

          Valued chances never waste
          Through thoughtless and imprudent haste.

          I tell the time of day, ’tis true,
          Yet mind my business; pray, do you?

          Time proves our work, so do not try
          To hide your faults or time defy.

          Remember when ’tis darkest night,
          The dawn will shortly be in sight.

          Hold not Thy hand, grant us’ true light,
          Let Thy command make all things bright.

          Thy neighbour’s landmark, so now mind,
          Who moveth me a curse will find.

          If, like some, I went the pace,
          Who would study then my face.

          A shadow rules our lives sublime,
          And takes the ancient name of time.

          Some men delight to weigh the showers,
          But few attempt to weigh the hours.

          Wait a moment never say,
          When hours you mean, or chance the day.

          Time was made for slaves, men say,
          Yet free men ask the time of day.

          Though every hour thou readest well,
          Thy final hour thou canst not tell.

          If of life you’d take your fill,
          Never work another ill.

          When the hours have ceased to run,
          ’Tis man, not Time, whose race is done.

          Like smoke, my hours are quickly gone,
          With only ashes left to mourn.

          Scarce with a smile I greet anew,
          Ere I do bid again adieu.

          The shadows rise, the shadows fall,
          Man sees but part, though God sees all.

          Husband thy hours with due care,
          For thus shalt thou extend the year.

          I govern all things by a measure,
          And keep the time in work and pleasure.

          Learn to borrow of the sun,
          Ere the night engulfs each one.

          Without the light the sun doth give,
          Not many men would care to live.

          The hours and minutes I ever renew,
          Like glorious rain or fall of the dew.

          I work for the sun and man alone,
          By marking the hours upon this stone.

          Learn, like me, to waste no time,
          Words are empty, actions climb.

          Man made this dial, with gnomon to plan
          A shadow in time to govern the man.

          Go, save thy time and mend thy ways,
          And thus prolong thy length of days.

          Come, learn the hour I have to tell,
          For like a friend I greet you well.

          Mortal, mortal, tell me why,
          You would live midst hours that die?

          All men equality shall know,
          When time for each has ceased to flow.

          Go, use the time as all men ought,
          A guide to life and food for thought.

          The hours of life will soon be passed,
          So live this day as if thy last.

          With certain seasons there is power,
          To alter the dials by minutes each hour.

          Good work ennobles everyone,
          And stands the test of time and sun.

          Learn, dear child, this one great truth,
          That all our love outlives our youth.

          Thy days are numbered, but by me
          Are only marked bright hours you see.

          When on me the hour you find,
          Traveller, traveller, know your mind.

          Man’s greatest friend’s his mother,
          Next this dial, then any other.

          Since hours to come are all in sight,
          O haste then while you have the light.

          The shades of night shall end the day,
          And drive the shade of light away.

          Man how to spend these hours proposes.
          But God alone my time disposes.

          Mark my shadow ere ’tis past,
          Not thy first, though chance thy last.

          Like a builder work and pray
          That all thy best outlives thy day.

          Let progress be thy motto bright,
          Forward thy watchword, while ’tis light.

          Faith I teach through hours I give,
          And men trust me while they live.

          I show the road to health this way,
          By ending work at close of day.

          God’s greatest gift to man is thine,
          To read the hour when sun doth shine.

          The greatest conquerors in strife,
          Is time, then love the light of life.

          These hours that please or that pain,
          Shall never by man be lived again.

          Let not thoughts of time depress,
          A heart that owes but thankfulness.

          Shine, sun, and let thy radiance bright
          Disperse the gloomy shades of night.

          Time hastens on an end too near,
          And friends grow dearer every year.

          Should with this day a sorrow come,
          All hours, remember, gladden some.

          My shadow keeps the time-worn track,
          Moving forward, but never back.

          Our time’s so short that all men should,
          Both start and end each day with good.

          God fill thy cup brim full of joy,
          And send thee hours that never cloy.

          To-morrow, men too often say,
          Forgetful that it is to-day.

          By shadow through the sun’s bright rays,
          Every day God’s name I praise.

          Leave sometimes the cares that kill,
          Seek the wood and seek the rill.

          Procrastination is a thief,
          That robs us of a pledged relief.

          Where the light of heaven rules,
          Time’s neglected but by fools.

          Go, kill the hour and waste the day,
          But count the forfeit you must pay.

          Behold my shadow on this wall,
          Warning to some and guide to all.

          Amidst the flowers of earth I stand,
          Ever at the sun’s command.

          I bring life and I bring breath,
          I bring shade and I bring death.

          Hours that come are hours that go,
          Waste not then the hours I show.

          Gold that called me into being,
          Cannot regulate time fleeing.

          With my gnomon I have power,
          To mark ye sun and tell ye hour.

          I remind of what is best,
          Hours of work and hours of rest.

          Without the sun I silent keep,
          Ever watchful, ne’er asleep.

          Ere each day doth end Time’s path,
          Gather up some aftermath.

          When the clouds of life have gone,
          Sun remains for every one.

          On your behalf the hours I tell,
          For others, too, who note me well.

          No one shall ever say of me,
          I marked a clouded hour to thee.

          Let the morrow ever find,
          You’ve advanced, not lagged behind.

          Like me, go work without a fuss,
          For we are labourers, both of us.

          Time passes silently away,
          By minutes, hours, and then the day.

          Let sun’s declining rays now teach,
          A greater lesson than I preach.

          Come, mortal, own this hour to be,
          A gift to frail humanity.

          Care and fear storm clouds never,
          Hide the sun for long or ever.

          True love, a circle, and the sun,
          Are not excelled, own equals none.

          He indeed shall happy be,
          Who makes the most of hours you see.

          If time by speech I could but tell,
          You, noisy cockerel, I’d excel.

          Each one alive some folk deride,
          And even me when sun doth hide.

          Without ye gnomon who can tell,
          Upon this dial where sunlight fell?

          Good luck, just like a summer’s sun,
          Lies in the path of everyone.

          Man need never darkness know,
          Who early to rise and sleep doth go.

          Traveller, take a look and see,
          I change each minute more than thee.

          With the rising sun I wake,
          And side by side our course we take.

          To-day is thine what God hath given,
          To-morrow may be first day’s heaven.

          He who sleeps both night and day,
          The cost of idleness must pay.

          To waste thy time is bad enough,
          But that of others, mortal, rough.

          Man, treat me with reverence,
          With time there’s no severance.

          I mark the hours as they come,
          But weary no man with the sum.

          Know the hour and thy mind,
          Thus fresh power you will find.

          Mark this hour and ere it dies,
          Let thy heart to Heaven rise.

          I am governed by the light,
          Man a shadow ’til the night.

          He who notes not hours or days,
          Time shall suddenly amaze.

          In your joy or in your sorrow,
          Sympathy from me come borrow.

          I’ve been ever taught to prove,
          Time’s eternal, so is love.

          I live a parable to all,
          Who note my shadow on this wall.

          I do my duty and I mark,
          The hours and minutes until dark.

          Pass on, like me, and let the day,
          Help thee further on thy way.

          Find in me a faithful friend,
          True and steadfast to the end.

          If but rightly understood,
          All God’s earthly gifts are good.

          Since Nature doth the seasons show,
          I only mark the hours that go.

          Every hour, each plant and flower,
          Gives reality to immortality.

          I live for ever, having done
          A work that’s worthy of the sun.

          Act thou like a shaft of light,
          Ere the chance is out of sight.

          I am only in disgrace.
          When the sun doth hide his face.

          Some evil you indeed must flee,
          If I become your enemy.

          May thy record in Heaven,
          Be like hours that I’ve given.

          The bright days only I record,
          But all are noted by the Lord.

          Like the flowers, ever try
          To catch the sun ere it go by.

          Take thy pleasure when you may,
          But to-day’s work do to-day.

          An hour never try to kill,
          For I can do that at my will.

          About the day I will not jest,
          But simply ask men for their best.

          He who made me I will show,
          Helped his fellows here below.

          If from my shadow you can learn,
          Do not then such wisdom spurn.

          Like the bee, go, hourly strive,
          Lest you find an empty hive.

          I fly, I walk, I run, I crawl,
          Yet own no wings or legs at all.

          My dial is a picture rare,
          On which the lives of all appear.

          A clock or bell a lie may tell,
          I never, if the sun shines well.

          I’m fast to some,
          Who’ve naught to come.

          Ye sunniest hour,
          Is ye life of a flower.

          The greatest gift supernal,
          Is love eternal.

          Since I never lose,
          A fresh excuse go choose.

          Keep working,
          No shirking.

          The hours of night
          Are well in sight.

          Halt ye and learn,
          Then quickly turn.

          Speed high, speed low,
          I swiftly go.

          When night doth flee,
          Men look at me.

          Our end gets nearer.
          And time grows dearer.

          Ere the day doth flee,
          Lord, remember me.

          Go live thy day,
          But watch and pray.

          Go, mortals befriend,
          Like me to the end.

          At each daybreak,
          My course I take.

          Halt not or stay,
          ’Til close of day.

          Ye hour of prayer,
          Is always here.

          Slow but sure,
          Who wants more?

          To enjoy thy days,
          Heed thy ways.

          Live and defy,
          All hours that fly.

          Mortal beware,
          Of time take care.

          Well done,
          Go up one.

          Time flies,
          The day dies.

          Sorrow and song,
          I bear along.

          What e’er betide,
          Dear Lord provide.

          Pray ye for light,
          Pray ye aright.

          The hours of day,
          Soon pass away.

          No rain, no flowers,
          No sun, no hours.

          Do not forget me,
          Lest you regret me.

          Though pace is slow,
          Yet fast I go.

          Go, know man time,
          By gnomon mine.

          Always using it,
          Never abusing it.

          A life well spent,
          Brings no lament.

          I only mark the time of day,
          But man how much has passed away.

          My hours used well are going to be,
          Thy passport through eternity.

          Learn, like me, to give and take,
          In silence and no noise to make.

          Ye watch this dial my speed to prove,
          Yet cannot see me make a move.

          Things come in cycles, so men say,
          But who shall view a yesterday?

          My use and value unto you,
          Is gauged by what you have to do.

          I regulate the lives of all,
          That walk, or run, or fly, or crawl.

          He the longest life shall live,
          Who makes the most of hours I give.

          The shades of night my dial enfold,
          Like a story that is told.

          Earn thou thy rest,
          So shall each hour improved by thee,
          Bring what is best continually.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
