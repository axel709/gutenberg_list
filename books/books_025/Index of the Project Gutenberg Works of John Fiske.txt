CHAPTER II.
PRE-COLUMBIAN VOYAGES.

Stories of voyages to America before Columbus; the Chinese 148
The Irish. 149

Northern limit of the vine 181
Length of the winter day 182
Indian corn 182, 183
Winter weather in Vinland 184
Vinland was probably situated somewhere between Cape Breton and Point Judith 185

The natives of Vinland as described in the Icelandic narratives 187-193
Meaning of the epithet "Skrælings" 188, 189

The Skrælings of Vinland were Indians,—very likely Algonquins 190
The "balista" or "demon's head" 191, 192
The story of the "uniped" 193
Character of the Icelandic records; misleading associations with the word "saga" 194
The comparison between Leif Ericsson and Agamemnon, made by a committee of the Massachusetts Historical Society, was peculiarly unfortunate and inappropriate 194, 197
The story of the Trojan War, in the shape in which we find it in Greek poetry, is pure folk-lore 195
The Saga of Eric the Red is not folk-lore 196
Mythical and historical sagas 197
The western or Hauks-bók version of Eric the Red's Saga 198
The northern or Flateyar-bók version 199

There is no reason for supposing that the Northmen founded a colony in Vinland 216
No archæological remains of them have been found south of Davis strait 217
If the Northmen had founded a successful colony, they would have introduced domestic cattle into the North American fauna 218
And such animals could not have vanished and left no trace of their existence 219, 220

Queer transformations of names 234-236
(p. xxvi) The name Færoislander became Frislanda 236
The narrative nowhere makes a claim to the "discovery of America" 237

Or does it represent actual experiences in North America? 249
The case of David Ingram, 1568 250
The case of Cabeza de Vaca, 1528-36 251
There may have been unrecorded instances of visits to North America 252
The pre-Columbian voyages made no real contributions to geographical knowledge 253
And were in no true sense a discovery of America 254
Real contact between the eastern and western hemisphere was first established by Columbus 255
CHAPTER III.

His second letter to Columbus 361, 362
Who first suggested the feasibleness of a westward route to the Indies? Was it Columbus? 363
Perhaps it was Toscanelli 363, 364
Note on the date of Toscanelli's first letter to Columbus 365-367
The idea, being naturally suggested by the globular form of the earth, was as old as Aristotle 368, 369
Opinions of ancient writers 370
Opinions of Christian writers 371
The "Imago Mundi" of Petrus Alliacus 372, 373

Toscanelli's calculation of the size of the earth, and of the position of Japan (Cipango) 375, 376
Columbus's opinions of the size of the globe, the length of the Œcumene, and the width of the Atlantic ocean from Portugal to Japan 377-380
There was a fortunate mixture of truth and error in these opinions of Columbus 381
The whole point and purport of Columbus's scheme lay in its promise of a route to the Indies shorter than that which the Portuguese were seeking by way of Guinea 381
Columbus's speculations on climate; his voyages to Guinea and into the Arctic ocean 382
He may have reached Jan Mayen island, and stopped at Iceland 383, 384
The Scandinavian hypothesis that Columbus "must have" heard and understood the story of the Vinland voyages 384, 385
It has not a particle of evidence in its favour 385
It is not probable that Columbus knew of Adam of Bremen's allusion to Vinland, or that he would have understood it if he had read it 386
It is doubtful if he would have stumbled upon the story in Iceland 387
If he had heard it, he would probably have classed it with such tales as that of St. Brandan's isle 388
(p. xxxi) He could not possibly have obtained from such a source his opinion of the width of the ocean 388, 389
If he had known and understood the Vinland story, he had the strongest motives for proclaiming it and no motive whatever for concealing it 390-392
No trace of a thought of Vinland appears in any of his voyages 393
Why did not Norway or Iceland utter a protest in 1493? 393

THE CRITICAL PERIOD AMERICAN HISTORY
1783–1789

The Newfoundland fisheries	20
Jay detects the schemes of Vergennes	21
And sends Dr Vaughan to visit Shelburne	22
John Adams arrives in Paris and joins with Jay in insisting upon a separate negotiation with England	23, 24
The separate American treaty, as agreed upon:
1. Boundaries	25
2. Fisheries; commercial intercourse	26
3. Private debts	27
4. Compensation of loyalists	28–32
Secret article relating to the Yazoo boundary	33
Vergennes does not like the way in which it has been done	33
On the part of the Americans it was a great diplomatic victory	34
Which the commissioners won by disregarding the instructions of Congress and acting on their own responsibility	35
The Spanish treaty	36
The French treaty	37
Coalition of Fox with North	38–42
They attack the American treaty in Parliament	43
And compel Shelburne to resign	44
Which leaves England without a government, while for several weeks the king is too angry to appoint ministers	44
Until at length he succumbs to the coalition, which presently adopts and ratifies the American treaty	45
The coalition ministry is wrecked upon Fox's India Bill	46
Constitutional crisis ends in the overwhelming victory of Pitt in the elections of May, 1784	47
And this, although apparently a triumph for the king, was really a death-blow to his system of personal government	48, 49
CHAPTER II.
THE THIRTEEN COMMONWEALTHS.
Cessation of hostilities in America	50
Departure of the British troops	51
Washington resigns his command	52

The next five years were the most critical years in American history	55
Absence of a sentiment of union, and consequent danger of anarchy	56, 57
European statesmen, whether hostile or friendly, had little faith in the stability of the Union	58

Ordination of Samuel Seabury by non-jurors at Aberdeen	84
Francis Asbury and the Methodists	85
Presbyterians and Congregationalists	86
Roman Catholics	87
Except in the instance of slavery, all the changes described in this chapter were favourable to the union of the states	88
But while the state governments, in all these changes, are seen working smoothly, we have next to observe, by contrast, the clumsiness and inefficiency of the federal government	89
CHAPTER III.
THE LEAGUE OF FRIENDSHIP.
The several states have never enjoyed complete sovereignty	90
But in the very act of severing their connection with Great Britain, they entered into some sort of union	91
Anomalous character of the Continental Congress	92
The articles of confederation; they sought to establish a "league of friendship" between the states	93–97
But failed to create a federal government endowed with real sovereignty	98–100

It was especially severe in New York	122

Character and early career of Alexander Hamilton	124–126
The case of Rutgers v. Waddington	127, 128
Wholesale emigration of Tories	129, 130
Congress unable to enforce payment of debts to British creditors	131
England retaliates by refusing to surrender the fortresses on the northwestern frontier	132, 133
CHAPTER IV.
DRIFTING TOWARD ANARCHY.
The barbarous superstitions of the Middle Ages concerning trade were still rife in the eighteenth century	134
The old theory of the uses of a colony	135
Pitt's unsuccessful attempt to secure free trade between Great Britain and the United States	136
Ship-building in New England	137
British navigation acts and orders in council directed against American commerce	138
John Adams tried in vain to negotiate a commercial treaty with Great Britain	139, 140
And could see no escape from the difficulties except in systematic reprisal	141
But any such reprisal was impracticable, for the several states imposed conflicting duties	142
Attempts to give Congress the power of regulating commerce were unsuccessful	143, 144
And the several states began to make commercial war upon one another	145
Attempts of New York to oppress New Jersey and Connecticut	146
Retaliatory measures of the two latter states	147
The quarrel between Connecticut and Pennsylvania over the possession of the valley of Wyoming	148–150
The quarrel between New York and New Hampshire over the possession of the Green Mountains	151–153
Failure of American diplomacy because European states could not tell whether they were dealing with one nation or with thirteen	154, 155

American citizens kidnapped and sold into slavery	159

The Madison-Tyler motion in the Virginia legislature	215
Convention at Annapolis, Sept 11, 1786	216

The other leading members	228
Washington chosen president of the convention	229
CHAPTER VI.
THE FEDERAL CONVENTION.
Why the proceedings of the convention were kept secret for so many years	230
Difficulty of the problem to be solved	231
Symptoms of cowardice repressed by Washington's impassioned speech	232
The root of all the difficulties; the edicts of the federal government had operated only upon states, not upon individuals, and therefore could not be enforced without danger of war	233–233
The Virginia plan, of which Madison was the chief author, offered a radical cure	236
And was felt to be revolutionary in its character	237–239
Fundamental features of the Virginia plan	240, 241
How it was at first received	242
The House of Representatives must be directly elected by the people	243
Question as to the representation of states brings out the antagonism between large and small states	244
William Paterson presents the New Jersey plan; not a radical cure, but a feeble palliative	245
Straggle between the Virginia and New Jersey plans	246–249
The Connecticut compromise, according to which the national principle is to prevail in the House of Representatives, and the federal principle in the Senate, meets at first with fierce opposition	250, 251
But is at length adopted	252
And proves a decisive victory for Madison and his methods	253
A few irreconcilable members go home in dudgeon	254
But the small states, having been propitiated, are suddenly converted to Federalism, and make the victory complete	255
Vague dread of the future west	255
The struggle between pro-slavery and anti-slavery parties began in the convention, and was quieted by two compromises	256
Should representation be proportioned to wealth or to population?	257
Were slaves to be reckoned as persons or as chattels?	258
Attitude of the Virginia statesmen	259
It was absolutely necessary to satisfy South Carolina	260
The three fifths compromise, suggested by Madison, was a genuine English solution, if ever there was one	261
There was neither rhyme nor reason in it, but for all that, it was the best solution attainable at the time	262
The next compromise was between New England and South Carolina as to the foreign slave-trade and the power of the federal government over commerce	263
George Mason calls the slave-trade an "infernal traffic"	264
And the compromise offends and alarms Virginia	265

Emphatic and unmistakable condemnation of paper money by all the leading delegates	274
The convention refused to grant to the federal government the power of issuing inconvertible paper, but did not think an express prohibition necessary	275
If they could have foreseen some recent judgments of the supreme court, they would doubtless have made the prohibition explicit and absolute	276
Debates as to the federal executive	277
Sherman's suggestion as to the true relation of the executive to the legislature	278
There was to be a single chief magistrate, but how should he be chosen?	279
Objections to an election by Congress	280
Ellsworth and King suggest the device of an electoral college, which is at first rejected	281
But afterwards adopted	282
Provisions for an election by Congress in the case of a failure of choice by the electoral college	283
Provisions for counting the electoral votes	284
It was not intended to leave anything to be decided by the president of the Senate	285
The convention foresaw imaginary dangers, but not the real ones	286
Hamilton's opinion of the electoral scheme	287
How it has actually worked	288
In this part of its work the convention tried to copy from the British Constitution	289
In which they supposed the legislative and executive departments to be distinct and separate	290
Here they were misled by Montesquieu and Blackstone	291
What our government would be if it were really like that of Great Britain	292–294
In the British government the executive department is not separated from the legislative	295
Circumstances which obscured the true aspect of the case a century ago	296–298
The American cabinet is analogous, not to the British cabinet, but to the privy council	299
The federal judiciary, and its remarkable character	300–301
Provisions for amending the Constitution	302
The document is signed by all but three of the delegates	303
And the convention breaks up	304
With a pleasant remark from Franklin	305

The Massachusetts convention meets	319
And overhauls the Constitution clause by clause	320
On the subject of an army Mr. Nason waxes eloquent	321

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in

redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project

        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
