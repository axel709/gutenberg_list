ELEANOR’S VICTORY.




CHAPTER I.

GOING HOME.


The craggy cliffs upon the Norman coast looked something like the
terraced walls and turreted roofs of a ruined city in the hot afternoon
sunshine, as the _Empress_ steamer sped swiftly onward toward Dieppe.
At least they looked thus in the eyes of a very young lady, who stood
alone on the deck of the steam-packet, with yearning eyes fixed upon
that foreign shore.

It was four o’clock upon a burning August afternoon in the year 1853.
The steamer was fast approaching the harbour. Several moustachioed
gentlemen, of various ages, costumes, and manners, were busy getting
together carpet-bags, railway-rugs, camp-stools, newspapers, and
umbrellas; preparatory to that eager rush towards the shore by which
marine voyagers are apt to testify their contempt for Neptune, when
they have no longer need of his service or fear of his vengeance. Two
or three English families were collected in groups, holding guard over
small mounds or barrows of luggage, having made all preparation for
landing at first sight of the Norman shore, dim in the distance; and of
course about two hours too soon.

Several blooming young English damsels, gathered under maternal wings,
were looking forward to sea-bathing in a foreign watering-place. The
Établissement des Bains had not yet been built, and Dieppe was not so
popular, perhaps, among English pleasure-seekers as it now is. There
were several comfortable-looking British families on board the steamer,
but of all the friendly matrons and pretty daughters assembled on the
deck, there seemed no one in any way connected with that lonely young
lady who leant against the bulwark with a cloak across her arm and a
rather shabby carpet-bag at her feet.

She was very young—indeed of that age which in the other sex is
generally called the period of hobbledehoyhood. There was more ankle to
be seen below the hem of her neat muslin frock than is quite consistent
with elegance of attire in a young lady of fifteen; but as the ankle
so revealed was rounded and slender, it would have been hypercritical
to have objected to the shortness of the skirt, which had evidently
been outgrown by its wearer.

Then, again, this lonely traveller was not only young but pretty. In
spite of the shortness of her frock and the shabbiness of her straw
bonnet, it was impossible for the most spiteful of the British misses
to affirm the contrary. She was very pretty; so pretty that it was a
pleasure to look at her, in her unconscious innocence, and to think how
beautiful she would be by-and-by, when that bright, budding girlish
loveliness bloomed out in its womanly splendour.

Her skin was fair, but pale—not a sentimental or sickly pallor, but a
beautiful alabaster clearness of tint. Her eyes were grey, large and
dark, or rendered dark by the shadow of long black lashes. I would
rather not catalogue her other features too minutely; for though they
were regular, and even beautiful, there is something low and material
in all the other features as compared to the eyes. Her hair was of
a soft golden brown, bright and rippling like a sunlit river. The
brightness of that luxuriant hair, the light in her grey eyes, and the
vivacity of a very beautiful smile, made her face seem almost luminous
as she looked at you. It was difficult to imagine that she could ever
look unhappy. She seemed an animated, radiant, and exuberant creature,
who made an atmosphere of brightness and happiness about her. Other
girls of her age would have crept to a corner of the deck, perhaps
to hide their loneliness, or would have clung to the outer fringe of
one of the family groups, making believe not to be alone; but this
young lady had taken her stand boldly against the bulwark, choosing
the position from which she might soonest hope to see Dieppe harbour,
and apparently quite indifferent to observation, though many a furtive
glance was cast towards the tall but girlish figure and the handsome
profile so sharply defined against a blue background of summer sky.

But there was nothing unfeminine in all this; nothing bold or defiant;
it was only the innocent unconsciousness of a light-hearted girl,
ignorant of any perils which could assail her loneliness, and fearless
in her ignorance. Throughout the brief sea-voyage she had displayed
no symptoms of shyness or perplexity. She had suffered none of the
tortures common to many travellers in their marine experiences. She
had not been sea-sick; and indeed she did not look like a person who
could be subject to any of the common ills this weak flesh inherits.
You could almost as easily have pictured to yourself the Goddess Hygeia
suffering from a bilious headache, or Hebe laid up with the influenza,
as this auburn-haired, grey-eyed young lady under any phase of mortal
suffering. Eyes dim in the paroxysms of sea-sickness had looked almost
spitefully towards this happy, radiant creature, as she flitted hither
and thither about the deck, courting the balmy ocean breezes that made
themselves merry with her rippling hair. Lips, blue with suffering,
had writhed as their owners beheld the sandwiches which this young
school-girl devoured, the stale buns, the oval raspberry tarts, the
hideous, bilious, revolting three-cornered puffs which she produced at
different stages of the voyage from her shabby carpet-bag.

She had an odd volume of a novel, and a long, dreary desert of
crochet-work, whose white-cotton monotony was only broken by occasional
dingy oases bearing witness of the worker’s dirty hands; they were such
pretty hands, too, that it was a shame they should ever be dirty; and
she had a bunch of flabby, faded flowers, sheltered by a great fan-like
shield of newspaper; and she had a smelling-bottle, which she sniffed
at perpetually, though she had no need of any such restorative, being
as fresh and bright from first to last as the sea breezes themselves,
and as little subject to any marine malady as the Lurleis whose waving
locks could scarcely have been yellower than her own.

I think, if the feminine voyagers on board the _Empress_ were cruel to
this solitary young traveller in not making themselves friendly with
her in her loneliness, the unkindness must be put down very much to
that unchristian frame of mind in which people who are sea-sick are apt
to regard those who are not. This bouncing, bright-faced girl seemed to
have little need of kindness from the miserable sufferers around her.
So she was left to wander about the deck; now reading three pages of
her novel; now doing half-a-dozen stitches of her work; now talking to
the man at the wheel, in spite of all injunctions to the contrary; now
making herself acquainted with stray pet dogs; always contented, always
happy; and no one troubled himself about her.

It was only now, when they were nearing Dieppe, that one of the
passengers, an elderly, grey-headed Englishman, spoke to her.

“You are very anxious to arrive,” he said, smiling at her eager face.

“Oh, yes, very anxious, sir. We are nearly there, are we not?”

“Yes, we shall enter the harbour presently. You will have some one to
meet you there, I suppose?”

“Oh, no,” the young lady answered, lifting her arched brown eyebrows,
“not at Dieppe. Papa will meet me at Paris; but he could never come all
the way to Dieppe, just to take me back to Paris. He could never afford
such an expense as that.”

“No, to be sure; and you know no one at Dieppe?”

“Oh, no; I don’t know any one in all France, except papa.”

Her face, bright as it was even in repose, was lit up with a new
brightness as she spoke of her father.

“You are very fond of your papa, I think,” the Englishman said.

“Oh, yes, I love him very, very much. I have not seen him for more
than a year. The journey costs so much between England and France, and
I have been at school near London, at Brixton; I dare say you know
Brixton; but I am going to France now, for good.”

“Indeed! You seem very young to leave school.”

“But I’m not going to leave school,” the young lady answered, eagerly.
“I am going to a very expensive school in Paris, to finish my
education; and then——”

She paused here, hesitating and blushing a little.

“And then what?”

“I am going to be a governess. Papa is not rich. He has no fortune now.”

“He has had a fortune, then?”

“He has had three.”

The young lady’s grey eyes were lit up with a certain look of triumph
as she said this.

“He has been very extravagant, poor dear,” she continued,
apologetically; “and he has spent three fortunes, altogether. But he
has always been so courted and admired, you know, that it is not to
be wondered at. He knew the Prince Regent, and Mr. Sheridan, and Mr.
Brummel, and the Duke of York, and—oh, all sorts of people, ever so
intimately; and he was a member of the Beefsteak Club, and wore a
silver gridiron in his button-hole, and he is the most delightful man
in society, even now, though he is very old.”

“Very old! And you are so young.”

The Englishman looked almost incredulously at his animated companion.

“Yes, I am papa’s youngest child. He has been married twice. I have no
real brothers and sisters. I have only half-brothers and sisters, who
don’t really and truly care for me, you know. How should they? They
were grown up when I was born, and I have scarcely ever seen them. I
have only papa in all the world.”

“You have no mother, then?”

“No; mamma died when I was three years old.”

The _Empress_ packet was entering the harbour by this time. The
grey-headed Englishman went away to look after his portmanteaus and
hat-boxes, but he returned presently to the fair-haired school-girl.

“Will you let me help you with your luggage?” he said. “I will go and
look after it, if you will tell me for what to inquire.”

“You are very kind. I have only one box. It is directed to Miss Vane,
Paris.”

“Very well, Miss Vane, I will go and find your box. Stay,” he said,
taking out his card-case, “this is my name, and if you will permit me,
I will see you safely to Paris.”

“Thank you, sir. You are very kind.”

The young lady accepted her new friend’s service as frankly as it
was offered. He had grey hair, and in that one particular at least
resembled her father. That was almost enough to make her like him.

There was the usual confusion and delay at the Custom-house—a little
squabbling and a good deal of bribery; but everything was managed,
upon the whole, pretty comfortably. Most of the passengers dropped in
at the Hôtel de l’Europe, or some of the other hotels upon the stony
quay; a few hurried off to the market-place, to stare at the cathedral
church of Saint Jacques, or the great statue of Abraham Duquesne,
the rugged sea-king, with broad-brimmed hat and waving plumes, high
boots and flowing hair, and to buy peaches and apricots of the noisy
market-women. Others wandered in the slimy and slippery fish-market,
fearfully and wonderingly contemplative of those hideous conger-eels,
dog-fish, and other piscatorial monstrosities which seem peculiar to
Dieppe. Miss Vane and her companion strolled into the dusky church of
Saint Jacques by a little wooden door in a shady nook of the edifice.
A few solitary women were kneeling here and there, half-hidden behind
their high-backed rush chairs. A fisherman was praying upon the steps
of a little chapel, in the solemn obscurity.

“I have never been here before,” Miss Vane whispered. “I came by
Dover and Calais, the last time; but this way is so much cheaper, and
I almost think it nicer, for the journey’s so short from London to
Newhaven, and I don’t mind the long sea voyage a bit. Thank you for
bringing me to see this cathedral.”

Half-an-hour after this the two travellers were seated in a first-class
carriage, with other railway passengers, French and English, hurrying
through the fair Norman landscape.

Miss Vane looked out at the bright hills and woods, the fruitful
orchards, and white-roofed cottages, so villa-like, fantastical,
and beautiful; and her face brightened with the brightening of the
landscape under the hot radiance of the sun. The grey-headed gentleman
felt a quiet pleasure in watching that earnest, hopeful, candid face;
the grey eyes, illumined with gladness; the parted lips, almost
tremulous with delight, as the sunny panorama glided by the open window.

The quiet old bachelor’s heart had been won by his companion’s frank
acceptance of his simple service.

“Another girl of her age would have been as frightened of a masculine
stranger as of a wild beast,” he thought, “and would have given herself
all manner of missish airs; but this young damsel smiles in my face,
and trusts me with almost infantile simplicity. I hope her father is
a good man. I don’t much like that talk of Sheridan and Beau Brummel
and the Beefsteak Club. No very good school for fathers that, I should
fancy. I wish her mother had been alive, poor child. I hope she is
going to a happy home, and a happy future.”

The train stopped at Rouen, and Miss Vane accepted a cup of coffee
and some _brioches_ from her companion. The red August sunset was
melting into grey mistiness by this time, and the first shimmer of
the moonlight was silvery on the water as they crossed the Seine and
left the lighted city behind them. The grey-headed Englishman fell
asleep soon after this, and before long there was a low chorus of
snoring, masculine and feminine, audible in the comfortable carriage;
only broken now and then, when the train stopped with a jerk at some
fantastic village that looked Like a collection of Swiss toy cottages
in the dim summer night.

But, let these matter-of-fact people snore and slumber as they might,
there was no such thing as sleep for Eleanor Vane. It would have been
utter sacrilege to have slept in the face of all that moonlighted
beauty, to have been carried sleeping through that fairy landscape. The
eager school-girl’s watchful eyes drank in the loveliness of every hill
and valley; the low scattered woodland; the watering streams; and that
perplexing Seine, which the rumbling carriage crossed so often with a
dismal hollow sound in the stillness of the night.

No; Miss Vane’s bright grey eyes were not closed once in that evening
journey; and at last, when the train entered the great Parisian
station, when all the trouble and confusion of arrival began—that
wearisome encounter of difficulty which makes cowardly travellers wish
the longest journey longer than it is—the young lady’s head was thrust
out of the window, and her eager eyes wandered hither and thither
amongst the faces of the crowd.

Yes, he was there—her father. That white-haired old man, with the
gold-headed cane, and the aristocratic appearance. She pointed him out
eagerly to her fellow-passenger.

“That is papa—you see,—the handsome man. He is coming this way, but he
doesn’t see us. Oh, let me out, please; let me go to him!”

She trembled in her eagerness, and her fair face flushed crimson with
excitement. She forgot her carpet-bag, her novel, her crochet, her
smelling-bottle, her cloak, her parasol—all her paraphernalia: and left
her companion to collect them as best he might. She was out of the
carriage and in her father’s arms she scarcely knew how. The platform
seemed deserted all in a moment, for the passengers had rushed away
to a great dreary _salle d’attente_, there to await the inspection
of their luggage. Miss Vane, her fellow-traveller, and her father,
were almost alone, and she was looking up at the old man’s face in the
lamplight.

“Papa, dear papa, darling, how well you are looking; as well as ever;
better than ever, I think!”

Her father drew himself up proudly. He was past seventy years of age,
but he was a very handsome man. His beauty was of that patrician type
which loses little by age. He was tall and broad-chested, erect as a
Grenadier, but not fat. The Prince Regent might become corpulent, and
lay himself open to the insolent sneers of his sometime boon companion
and friend; but Mr. George Mowbray Vandeleur Vane held himself on his
guard against that insidious foe which steals away the graces of so
many elderly gentlemen. Mr. Vane’s aristocratic bearing imparted such a
stamp to his clothes, that it was not easy to see the shabbiness of his
garments; but those garments were shabby. Carefully as they had been
brushed, they bore the traces of that slow decay which is not to be
entirely concealed, whatever the art of the wearer.

Miss Vane’s travelling companion saw all this. He had been so much
interested by the young lady’s frank and fearless manner, that he would
fain have lingered in the hope of learning something of her father’s
character; but he felt that he had no excuse for delaying his departure.

“I will wish you good night, now, Miss Vane,” he said, kindly, “since
you are safely restored to your papa.”

Mr. Vane lifted his grey eyebrows, looked at his daughter
interrogatively; rather suspiciously, the traveller thought.

“Oh, papa, dear,” the young lady answered, in reply to that questioning
look, “this gentleman was on board the boat with me, and he has been so
very kind.”

She searched in her pocket for the card which her acquaintance had
given her, and produced that document, rather limp and crumpled. Her
father looked at it, murmured the name inscribed upon it twice or
thrice, as if trying to attach some aristocratic association thereto,
but evidently failed in doing so.

“I have not the honour of—a—haw—knowing this name, sir,” he said,
lifting his hat stiffly about half a yard from his silvered head; “but
for your courtesy and kindness to my child, I hope you will accept
my best thanks. I was prevented by important business of—a—haw—not
altogether undiplomatic character—from crossing the Channel to fetch my
daughter; and—aw—also—prevented from sending my servant—by—aw—I thank
you for your politeness, sir. You are a stranger, by the way. Can I
do anything for you in Paris? Lord Cowley is my very old friend; any
service that I can render you in that quarter—I——”

The traveller bowed and smiled.

“Thank you very much,” he said, “I am no stranger in Paris. I will wish
you good night; good night, Miss Vane.”

But Mr. Vane was not going to let his daughter’s friend off so
easily. He produced his card-case, murmured more pompous assurances
of his gratitude, and tendered further offers of patronage to the
quiet traveller, who found something rather oppressive in Mr. Vane’s
civility. But it was all over at last, and the old man led his daughter
off to look for the trunk which contained all her worldly possessions.

The stranger looked wistfully after the father and child.

“I hope she may have a happy future,” he thought, rather despondingly;
“the old man is poor and pompous. He tells lies which bring hot blushes
into his daughter’s beautiful face. I am very sorry for her.”




CHAPTER II.

THE ENTRESOL IN THE RUE DE L’ARCHEVÊQUE.


Mr. Vane took his daughter away from the station in one of those
secondary and cheaper vehicles which are distinguished by the
discriminating Parisian by some mysterious difference of badge. The
close, stifling carriage rattled over the uneven stones of long streets
which were unfamiliar to Eleanor Vane, until it emerged into the full
glory of the lighted Boulevard. The light-hearted school-girl could
not suppress a cry of rapture as she looked once more at the broad
thoroughfare, the dazzling lamps, the crowd, the theatres, the cafés,
the beauty and splendour, although she had spent her summer holiday in
Paris only a year before.

“It seems so beautiful again, papa,” she said, “just as if I’d never
seen it before; and I’m to stop here now, and never, never to leave you
again, to go away for such a cruel distance. You don’t know how unhappy
I’ve been, sometimes, papa dear. I wouldn’t tell you then, for fear of
making you uneasy; but I can tell you now, now that it’s all over.”

“Unhappy!” gasped the old man, clenching his fist; “they’ve not been
unkind to you—they’ve not dared——”

“Oh, no, dearest father. They’ve been very, very good. I was quite
a favourite, papa. Yes, though there were so many rich girls in the
school, and I was only a half-boarder, I was quite a favourite with
Miss Bennett and Miss Sophia; though I know I was careless and lazy
sometimes—not on purpose, you know, papa, for I tried hard to get on
with my education, for your sake, darling. No, everybody was very kind
to me, papa; but I used to think sometimes how far I was from you;
what miles and miles and miles of sea and land there were between as,
and that if you should be ill—I——”

Eleanor Vane broke down, and her father clasped her in his arms, and
cried over her silently. The tears came with very little provocation to
the old man’s handsome blue eyes. He was of that sanguine temperament
which to the last preserves the fondest delusions of youth. At
seventy-five years of age he hoped and dreamed and deluded himself as
foolishly as he had done at seventeen. His sanguine temperament had
been for ever leading him astray for more than sixty years. Severe
judges called George Vane a liar; but perhaps his shallow romances, his
pitiful boasts, were more often highly-coloured and poetical versions
of the truth, than actual falsehood.

It was past twelve o’clock when the carriage drove away from the lights
and splendour into the darkness of a labyrinth of quiet streets behind
the Madeleine. The Rue de l’Archevêque was one of these dingy and
quiet streets, very narrow, very close and stifling in the hot August
midnight. The vehicle stopped abruptly at a corner, before a little
shop, the shutters of which were closed, of course, at this hour.

“It is a butcher’s shop, I am sorry to say, my love,” Mr. Vane said,
apologetically, as he handed his daughter on to the pavement; “but I
find myself very comfortable here, and it is conveniently adjacent to
the Boulevards.”

The old man paid the driver, who had deposited mademoiselle’s box
upon the threshold of the little door beside the butcher’s shop.
The _pourboire_ was not a very large one, but Mr. Vane bestowed it
with the air of a prince. He pushed open the low door, and took his
daughter into a narrow passage. There was no porter or portress, for
the butcher’s shop and the apartments belonging to it were abnormal
altogether; but there was a candle and box of matches on a shelf in a
corner of the steep corkscrew staircase. The driver carried Eleanor’s
box as far as the entresol in consideration of his _pourboire_, but
departed while Mr. Vane was opening the door of an apartment facing the
staircase.

The entresol consisted of three little rooms, opening one out of
another, and so small and low that Miss Vane almost fancied herself
in a doll’s house. Every article of furniture in the stifling little
apartment bore the impress of its nationality. Tawdry curtains of
figured damask, resplendent with dirty tulips and monster roses,
tarnished ormolu mouldings, a gilded clock with a cracked dial and
a broken shade, a pair of rickety bronze candlesticks, a couple of
uncompromising chairs covered with dusty green velvet and relieved
by brass-headed nails, and a square table with a long trailing cover
of the same material as the curtains, completed the adornments of
the sitting-room. The bed-chambers were smaller, closer, and hotter.
Voluminous worsted curtains falling before the narrow windows,
and smothering the little beds, made the stifling atmosphere yet
more stifling. The low ceilings seemed to rest on the top of poor
Eleanor’s head. She had been accustomed to large airy rooms, and broad
uncurtained open windows.

“How hot it is here, papa,” she said, drawing a long breath.

“It always is hot in Paris at this time of year, my dear,” Mr. Vane
answered; “the rooms are small, you see, but convenient. That is to be
your bedroom, my love,” he added, indicating one of the little chambers.

He was evidently habituated to Parisian lodging-houses, and saw no
discomfort in the tawdry grandeur, the shabby splendour, the pitiful
attempt to substitute scraps of gilding and patches of velvet for the
common necessaries and decencies of life.

“And now let me look at you, my dear; let me look at you, Eleanor.”

George Mowbray Vane set the candlestick upon the rusty velvet cover of
the low mantel-piece, and drew his daughter towards him. She had thrown
off her bonnet and loose grey cloak, and stood before her father in her
scanty muslin frock, with all her auburn hair hanging about her face
and shoulders, and glittering in the dim light of that one scrap of wax
candle.

“My pet, how beautiful you have grown, how beautiful!” the old man
said, with an accent of fond tenderness. “We’ll teach Mrs. Bannister a
lesson some of these days, Eleanor. Yes, our turn will come, my love; I
know that I shall die a rich man.”

Miss Vane was accustomed to hear this remark from her father. She
inherited something of his sanguine nature, and she loved him very
dearly, so she may be forgiven if she believed in his vague visions of
future grandeur. She had never seen anything in her life but chaotic
wrecks of departed splendour, confusion, debt, and difficulty. She had
not been called upon to face poverty in the fair hand-to-hand struggle
which ennobles and elevates the sturdy wrestler in the battle of life.
No, she had rather been compelled to play at hide-and-seek with the
grim enemy. She had never gone out into the open, and looked her foe
full in the eyes, hardy, resolute, patient, and steadfast. She was
familiar with all those debasing tricks and pitiful subterfuges whereby
the weak and faint-hearted seek to circumvent the enemy; but she had
never been taught the use of those measures by which he may be honestly
beaten.

The Mrs. Bannister of whom George Vane had spoken, was one of his elder
daughters, who had been very, very ungrateful to him, he declared; and
who now in his old age doled him out the meagre allowance which enabled
him to occupy an entresol over a butcher’s shop, and dine daily at one
of the cheap restaurants in the Palais Royal.

Mr. Vane was wont to lament his daughter’s cruel lack of affection in
very bitter language, freely interspersed with quotations from “King
Lear;” indeed I believe he considered his case entirely parallel with
that of the injured British monarch and father; ignoring the one rather
important fact that, whereas Lear’s folly had been the too generous
division of his own fortune between his recreant daughters, _his_
weakness had been the reckless waste and expenditure of the portions
which his children had inherited from their mother.

Mrs. Bannister, instigated thereto by her husband, had protested some
years before against the several acts of folly and extravagance by
which the fortune which ought to have been hers had been fooled away.
She declined to allow her father more than the pittance alluded to
above; although, as she was now a rich widow, and of course entirely
her own mistress, she might have done much more.

“Yes, my darling,” Mr. Vane said, as he proudly contemplated his
youngest child’s beauty, “we will turn the tables upon Mrs. Bannister
and the rest of them, yet, please God. My Benjamin; my youngest,
brightest darling; we’ll teach them a lesson. They may poke their old
father away in a foreign lodging, and stint him of money for any little
innocent pleasure; but the day will come, my love, the day will come!”

The old man nodded his head two or three times with solemn
significance. The sanguine, impulsive nature, dwarfed and fettered by
the cruel bonds of poverty, was too elastic to be entirely repressed
even by those galling chains; and having hoped all his life, and
having enjoyed such successes and good fortune as fall to the lot of
very few men, he went on hoping in his old age, blindly confident that
some sudden revolution in the wheel of life would lift him out of his
obscurity and set him again on the pinnacle he had once occupied so
proudly.

He had had a host of friends and many children, and he had squandered
more than one fortune, not being any more careful of other people’s
money than of his own; and now, in his poverty and desolation, the
child of his old age was the only one who clung to him, and loved him,
and believed in him; the only one whom he loved, perhaps, truly and
unreservedly, though he wept frequently over the ingratitude of the
others. It may be that Eleanor was the only one whom he could love with
any comfort to himself, because the only one he had never injured.

“But, papa, dear,” this youngest and best loved of the old man’s
children pleaded gently, “Mrs. Bannister, Hortensia, has been very
good—has she not?—in sending the money for my education at Madame
Marly’s, where she was finished herself. That was very generous of her,
wasn’t it, papa?”

Mr. Vane shook his head, and lifted his grey eyebrows with a
deprecating expression.

“Hortensia Bannister cannot perform a generous act in a generous
manner, my dear. You recognize the viper by the reptile’s sting: you
may recognize Hortensia in pretty much the same manner. She gives, but
she insults the recipients of her—ahem—bounty. Shall I read you her
letter, Eleanor?”

“If you please, dear papa.”

The young lady had seated herself, in a somewhat hoydenish manner,
upon the elbow of her father’s chair, and had wound her soft round
arm about his neck. She loved him and believed in him. The world
which had courted and admired him while he had money and could boast
such acquaintance as the Prince and Sheridan, Sir Francis Burdett,
Lord Castlereagh, Mr. Pitt, and the Duke of York, had fallen away
from him of late; and the few old associates who yet remained of that
dead-and-gone cycle were apt to avoid him, influenced perhaps by the
recollection of small loans of an occasional five-pound note, and a
“little silver,” which had not been repaid. Yes, the world had fallen
away from George Mowbray Vandeleur Vane, once of Vandeleur Park,
Cheshire, and Mowbray Castle, near York. The tradesmen who had helped
him to squander his money had let him get very deep in their books
before they closed those cruel ledgers, and stopped all supplies.
He had existed for a long time—he had lived as a gentleman, he said
himself—upon the traditions of the past, the airy memories of the
fortunes he had wasted. But this was all over now, and he had emigrated
to the city in which he had played the Grand Seigneur in those glorious
early days of the Restoration, and where he was compelled to lead a
low and vulgar life, disgracing himself by pettifogging ready-money
dealings, utterly degrading to a gentleman.

He could not bring himself to own that he was better and happier in
this new life, and that it was pleasant to be able to walk erect and
defiant upon the Boulevards, rather than to be compelled to plunge
down dark alleys, and dive into sinuous byways, for the avoidance of
importunate creditors, as he had been in free England.

He took his wealthy daughter’s letter from the breast-pocket of his
coat; a fashionable coat, though shabby now, for it had been made
for him by a sentimental German tailor, who had wept over his late
patron’s altered fortunes, and given him credit for a suit of clothes.
That compassionate German tailor never expected to be paid, and the
clothes were a benefaction, a gift as purely and generously given as
any Christian dole offered in the holy name of charity; but Mr. Vane
was pleased with the fiction of an expected payment, and would have
revolted against the idea of receiving a present from the good-natured
tradesman.

The letter from Hortensia Bannister was not a long one. It was written
in sharp and decisive paragraphs, and in a neat firm hand. Rather a
cruel-looking hand, Eleanor Vane thought.

The old man put a double gold eyeglass over his nose, and began to read.

  “_Hyde Park Gardens, August, 1853._

 “MY DEAR FATHER,—In compliance with your repeated solicitations I have
 determined upon taking measures by which I hope the future welfare of
 your youngest daughter may be secured.

 “I must, however, remind you that Eleanor Vane and I are the children
 of different mothers; that she has, therefore, less claim upon me than
 a sister usually has; and I freely confess I never heard of one sister
 being called upon to provide for another.

 “You must also remember that I never entertained any degree of
 friendship or affection for Eleanor’s mother, who was much below you
 in station, and whom you married in direct opposition to myself and my
 sisters——”

Eleanor started; she was too impetuous to listen quite passively to
this letter. Her father felt the sudden movement of the arm about his
neck.

“Your mother was an angel, my dear,” he said; “and this woman is—never
mind what. My daughters chose to give themselves airs to your poor
mother because she had been their governess, and because her father had
failed as a sugar-broker.”

He went back to the letter, groping nervously for the place at which he
had left off, with the point of his well-shaped finger—

 “But you tell me that you have no power to make any provision
 whatsoever for your daughter; and that, unless I assist you, this
 unhappy girl may, in the event of your death, be flung penniless upon
 the world, imperfectly educated, and totally incompetent to get her
 living.”

“She speaks of my death very freely,” the old man murmured, “but she’s
right enough. I shan’t trouble anybody long, my dear; I shan’t trouble
anybody long.”

The tender arms wound themselves more closely about George Vane’s neck.

“Papa, darling,” the soft voice whispered, “you have never troubled
_me_. Don’t go on with that horrid letter, papa. _We_ won’t accept any
favours from such a woman.”

“Yes, yes, my love, for your sake; if I stoop, it is for your sake,
Eleanor.”

The old man went on reading.

 “Under these circumstances,” the writer continued, “I have come to
 the following determination. I will give you a hundred pounds, to be
 paid to Madame Marly, who knows you, and has received a great deal of
 money from you for my education and that of my sisters, and who will,
 therefore, be inclined to receive Eleanor upon advantageous terms.
 For this sum of money Madame Marly will, I feel assured, consent to
 prepare my half-sister for the situation of governess in a gentleman’s
 family; that is, of course, premising that Eleanor has availed herself
 conscientiously of the advantages afforded her by her residence with
 the Misses Bennett.

 “I shall write to Madame Marly by this post, using my best influence
 with her for Eleanor’s benefit; and should I receive a favourable
 reply to this letter, I will immediately send you an order for a
 hundred pounds, to be paid by you to Madame Marly.

 “I do this in order that you may not appear to my old instructress—who
 remembers you as a rich man—in the position of a pauper; but in thus
 attempting to spare your feelings, and perhaps my own, I fear that I
 run some risk.

 “Let me therefore warn you that this money is the last I will ever pay
 for my half-sister’s benefit. Squander or misuse it if you please. You
 have robbed me often, and would not perhaps hesitate to do so again.
 But bear in mind, that this time it is Eleanor you will rob and not me.

 “The only chance she will have of completing her education is
 the chance I now give her. Rob her of this and you rob her of
 an honourable future. Deprive her of this and you make yourself
 answerable for any misfortunes which may befall her when you are dead
 and gone.

 “Forgive me if I have spoken harshly, or even undutifully; my excuse
 lies in your past follies. I have spoken strongly because I wished to
 make a strong impression, and I believe that I have acted for the best.

 “Once for all, remember that I will attend to no future solicitations
 on Eleanor’s behalf. If she makes good use of the help I now
 afford her, I may perhaps be tempted to render her further
 services—unsolicited—in the future. If she or you make a bad use
 of this one chance, I wash my hands of all concern in your future
 miseries.

 “The money will be made payable at Messrs. Blount’s, Rue de la Paix.

 “I trust you attend the Protestant Church in the Rue Rivoli.

 “With best wishes for your welfare, temporal and eternal, I remain, my
 dear father,

  “Your affectionate daughter,
  “HORTENSIA BANNISTER.”

George Vane burst into tears as he finished the letter. How cruelly she
had stabbed him, this honourable, conscientious daughter, whom he had
robbed certainly, but in a generous, magnanimous, reckless fashion,
that made robbery rather a princely virtue than a sordid vice. How
cruelly the old heart was lacerated by that bitter letter!

“As if I would touch the money,” cried Mr. Vane, elevating his
trembling hands to the low ceiling with a passionate and tragic
gesture. “Have I been such a wretch to you, Eleanor, that this woman
should accuse me of wishing to snatch the bread from your innocent
lips?”

“Papa, papa!”

“Have I been such an unnatural father, such a traitor, liar, swindler,
and cheat, that my own daughter should say these things to me?”

His voice rose higher with each sentence, and the tears streamed down
his wrinkled cheeks.

Eleanor tried to kiss away those tears; but he pushed her from him with
passionate vehemence.

“Go away from me, my child, I am a wretch, a robber, a scoundrel, a——”

“No, no, no, papa,” cried Eleanor; “you are all that is good; you have
always been good to me, dear, dear papa.”

“By what right, then, does this woman insult me with such a letter as
that?” asked the old man, drying his eyes, and pointing to the crumpled
letter which he had flung upon the ground.

“She has no right, papa,” answered Eleanor. “She is a wicked, cruel
woman. But we’ll send back her money. I’d rather go out into the world
at once, papa, and work for you: I’d rather be a dressmaker. I could
learn soon if I tried very hard. I do know a little about dressmaking.
I made this dress, and it fits very well, only I cut out both the backs
for one side, and both sleeves for one arm, and that wasted the stuff,
you know, and made the skirt a little scanty. I’d rather do anything,
papa, than accept this money,—I would indeed. I don’t want to go to
this grand Parisian school, except to be near you, papa, darling. That
was the only thing I ever cared for. The Miss Bennetts would take me as
a pupil teacher, and give me fifteen pounds a year, and I’d send every
shilling of it to you, papa, and then you needn’t live over a wretched
shop where the meat smells nasty in the warm weather. We won’t take the
money, will we, papa?”

The old man shook his head, and made a motion with his lips and throat,
as if he had been gulping down some bitter draught.

“Yes, my dear,” he said, in a tone of ineffable resignation, “for your
sake I would suffer many humiliations; for your sake I will endure
this. We will take no notice of this woman’s letter; though I could
write her a reply that—but no matter. We will let her insolence pass,
and she shall never know how keenly it has stung me here!”

He tapped his breast as he spoke, and the tears rose again to his eyes.

“We will accept this money, Eleanor,” he continued, “we will accept
her bounty; and the day may come when you will have ample power to
retaliate—ample power, my dear. She has called me a thief, Eleanor,”
exclaimed the old man, suddenly returning to his own wrongs, “a thief!
My own daughter has called me a thief, and accused me of the baseness
of robbing you.”

“Papa, papa, darling.”

“As if your father could rob you of this money, Eleanor; as if I could
touch a penny of it. No, so help me, Heaven! not a penny of it to save
me from starving.”

His head sank forward upon his breast, and he sat for some minutes
muttering to himself in broken sentences, as if almost unconscious
of his daughter’s presence. In that time he looked older than he had
looked at any moment since his daughter had met him at the station.
Watching him now, wistfully and sorrowfully, Eleanor Vane saw that her
father was indeed an old man, vacillating and weak of purpose, and with
ample need of all the compassionate tenderness, the fond affection,
which overflowed her girlish heart as she looked at him. She knelt down
on the slippery oaken floor at his feet, and took his tremulous hand in
both of hers.

He started as she touched him, and looked at her.

“My darling,” he cried, “you’ve had nothing to eat; you’ve been nearly
an hour in the house, and you’ve had nothing to eat. But I’ve not
forgotten you, Nell; you’ll find I’ve not forgotten you.”

He rose from his chair, and went over to a little cupboard in the wall,
from which he took a couple of plates and tumblers, some knives and
forks, and two or three parcels wrapped in white paper, and neatly tied
with narrow red tape. He put these on the table, and going a second
time to the cupboard produced a pint bottle of Burgundy, in a basket;
very dusty and cobwebby; and therefore, no doubt, very choice.

The white paper parcels contained very recherché comestibles. A slender
wedge of truffled turkey, some semi-transparent slices of German
sausage, and an open plum tart, with a great deal of rich ruby-coloured
syrup, and an utterly uneatable crust.

Miss Vane partook very freely of this little collation, praising her
father for his goodness and indulgence as she ate the simple feast
he had prepared for her. But she did not like the Burgundy in the
dusty basket, and preferred to drink some water out of one of the
toilette-bottles.

Her father, however, enjoyed the pint of good wine, and recovered his
equanimity under its generous influence. He had never been a drunkard;
he had indeed one of those excitable natures which cannot endure the
influence of strong drinks, and a very little wine had considerable
effect upon him.

He talked a good deal, therefore, to his daughter, told her some of
his delusive hopes in the future, tried to explain some of the plans
which he had formed for his and her advancement, and was altogether
very happy and social. The look of age, which had been so strong upon
him half an hour before, faded out like a grey morning shadow under
the broadening sunlight. He was a young man again; proud, hopeful,
reckless, handsome; ready to run through three more fortunes, if they
should fall to his lot.

It was past two o’clock when Eleanor Vane lay down, thoroughly
exhausted, but not weary—she had one of those natures which seem never
to grow weary—to fall asleep for the first time in four-and-twenty
hours.

Her father did not quite so quickly fall into a peaceful slumber. He
lay awake for upwards of an hour, tumbling and tossing to and fro upon
the narrow spring mattress, and muttering to himself.

And even in his sleep, though the early summer dawn was grey in the
room when he fell into a fitful and broken slumber, the trouble of his
eldest daughter’s letter was heavy upon him, for every now and then he
muttered, disjointly,—

“Thief—swindler! As if—as if—I would—rob—my own daughter.”




CHAPTER III.

THE STORY OF THE PAST.


The history of George Mowbray Vandeleur Vane was the history of many
men whose lot it was to shine in that brilliant orbit of which George,
Prince Regent, was the ruling star. Around that dazzling royal planet
how many smaller lights revolved, twinkling in humble emulation of
their prince’s glory. What were fortune, friends, children, wives,
or creditors, when weighed in the balance, if the royal favour, the
princely smile, hung on the other side of the scale? If George the
Fourth was pleased to bring ruin upon himself and his creditors, how
should his friends and associates do less? Looking backward at the
spurious glitter, the mock splendour, the hollow delight of that
wonderful age which is so near us in point of time, so far away from us
by reason of the wide differences which divide to-day from that foolish
yesterday, we can of course afford to be very wise, and can clearly see
what a very witches’ sabbath was that long revelry in which the Fourth
George of England led the dance. But who shall doubt that the dancers
themselves saw the fantastic caperings of their leader in a very
different light, and looked upon their model as worthy of all mortal
praise and imitation.

The men of that frivolous era seem to have abandoned themselves to
unmanly weakness, and followed the fashions set them by the fat and
pale-faced Royal Adonis, as blindly as the women of to-day emulate the
Imperial caprices of the Tuileries, sacrificing themselves as burnt
offerings to the Moloch of Fashion, in obedience to the laws made
by a lady who lives in a palace; and who, when she wears her silken
robe three yards in length and six in circumference, can scarcely be
expected to foresee the nervous tortures by-and-by to be endured by Mr.
John Smith, of Peckham Rye, whose wife will insist on having a hoop
and train _à l’ Oojénee_, and sweeping her superabundant skirts into
the fender and across the back of the grate every time she steers her
difficult way about the worthy Smith’s fourteen feet by twelve front
parlour.

Yes, if Cleopatra melts pearls in her wine, and sails in a galley of
gold, we must have sham jewels to dissolve in our inferior vintages,
and sham gold to adorn our galleys. If Pericles, or Charles, or George,
affects splendour and ruin, the prince’s devoted subjects must ruin
themselves also, never letting their master see anything but smiling
faces amid the general wreck, and utterly heedless of such minor
considerations as wives and children, creditors and friends.

George Mowbray Vandeleur Vane ruined himself with a grace that was only
second to that of his royal model. He began life with a fair estate
left him by his father, and having contrived to squander the best part
of his patrimony within a few years of his coming of age, was so lucky
as to marry the only daughter and heiress of a rich banker, thereby
acquiring a second fortune just at that critical moment when the first
was on the verge of exhaustion. He was not a bad husband to the simple
girl who loved and worshipped him with a foolishly confiding worship.
It was not in his nature to be wilfully bad to anybody; for he was of a
genial, generous spirit, with warm affections for those who pleased him
and ministered to his happiness. He introduced his young wife to very
brilliant people, and led her into sacred and inner circles, whither
her father the banker could never have taken her; but he squandered
her money foolishly and recklessly. He broke down the bulwarks of
parchment with which the lawyers had hoped to protect her fortune. He
made light of the settlements which were to provide for the future of
his children. They were only blooming and beautiful young creatures
in cambric frocks and blue sashes; and surely, Mr. Vane urged, they
had nothing to complain of, for hadn’t they splendid apartments and
costly dresses, nurses, governesses, masters, carriages, ponies, and
indulgences of every kind? What did they want, then, or in what manner
did he fail in his duty towards those innocent darlings? Had not his
Royal Highness the Duke of Kent himself come to Vandeleur to stand
sponsor for Edward George? Had not Hortensia Georgina received her
second name after the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire, in whose lovely
arms she had been dandled when only a fortnight old?

Were there any earthly honours or splendours, within the limit of
reasonable desire, which George Vane had failed to procure for his wife
and children?

The gentle lady was fain to answer this question in the negative, and
to accept it for what it was not; namely, an answer to the questions
_she_ had ventured to ask touching the future of those unconscious
children. Mr. Vane could always persuade his simple wife to sign
away any of those parchment defences the lawyers had devised for her
protection; and when, after an elegant little _tête-à-tête_ dinner, in
the arrangement of which the _chef_ had displayed his most consummate
skill, the affectionate husband produced a diamond bracelet or an
emerald heart from its morocco casket, and clasped the jewel upon his
wife’s slender arm, or hung it round her delicate throat, with the
tears glistening in his handsome blue eyes, gentle Margaret Vane forgot
the sacrifices of the morning, and all those shadowy doubts which were
wont to torment her when she contemplated the future.

Then, again, Mr. Vane had an unfailing excuse for present imprudence in
the expectation of a third fortune, which was to come to him from his
bachelor uncle and godfather, Sir Milwood Mowbray, of Mowbray Castle,
York; so that there were no vulgar retrenchments either at Vandeleur
Park or in Berkeley Square, and when Sir Milwood’s fortune did come,
in the due course of life and death, to his nephew’s hands, it only
came just in time to stave off the rain that threatened George Vane’s
household.

If Mr. Vane had then taken his wife’s advice, all might have been
well; but the Mowbray fortune seemed like the two other fortunes,
quite inexhaustible; the sanguine gentleman forgetting that he was in
debt to full half its amount. The French _chef_ still prepared dinners
which might have made Oude himself tremble for his laurels; the German
governess and the Parisian lady’s-maids still attended upon Mr. Vane’s
daughters; the old career of extravagance went on. George Vane carried
his family to the Continent, and plunged them in to new gaieties at
the court of the restored Louis. He sent his daughters to the most
expensive finishing-school in Paris, that very Madame Marly’s of whom
mention has been made in the last chapter. He took them to Italy and
Switzerland. He hired a villa by the Lake of Como; a chateau on the
borders of Lucerne. He followed the footsteps of Byron and D’Orsay,
Madame de Staël and Lady Blessington; he affected art, literature, and
music. He indulged his children’s every caprice, he gratified their
wildest fancies. It was only when the sons saw themselves penniless and
professionless, with the great battle of life all before them, and with
no weapons wherewith to fight; and the daughters found themselves left
portionless, to win the best husbands they might in the matrimonial
lottery: it was only at this crisis that these ungrateful children
turned round upon poor, indulgent Lear, and reproached him for the
extravagances they had helped him to perpetrate.

This was a cruelty which George Vane could never bring himself to
comprehend. Had he denied them anything, these heartless children,
that they should turn upon him now in his old age—it would have been
rather a dangerous thing for any one else to have alluded to his age,
though he spoke freely enough of his grey hairs when bewailing his
wrongs—and be angry with him because he could not give them fortunes?
This thanklessness was worse than a serpent’s tooth. It was now that
Mr. Vane began to quote “King Lear,” piteously likening himself to that
too confiding monarch.

But he was sixty years old now, and had lived his life. His gentle and
trusting wife had died ten years before his money was gone, and of
all his four children there was not one who would say a word in his
defence. The most affectionate and dutiful of them were only silent,
and thought they did much in withholding their reproaches. So he let
them go their ways, the two sons to fight the battle of life how
they might—the two daughters to marry. They were both handsome and
accomplished, and they married well. And being left quite alone in the
world, with nothing but the traditions of a brilliant past, Mr. Vane
united his misfortunes to those of a very beautiful girl, who had been
his daughters’ governess, and who had fallen in love with his splendid
graces in the very simplicity of her heart, thinking his grey hairs
more beautiful than the raven locks of meaner men.

Yes: George Vane possessed this gift of fascination in a dangerous
degree, and his second wife loved and believed in him in the day of his
decline, as entirely as his first wife had done in the brighter hours
of his prosperity. She loved and trusted him. She bore with a life of
perpetual debt and daily difficulty. She sacrificed herself to the mean
shifts and petty stratagems of a dishonest existence. She, whose nature
was truth itself, humiliated herself for her husband’s sake, and helped
to play that pitiful, skulking game of hide-and-seek in which George
Vane hoped to escape the honest struggles of poverty.

But she died young, worn out, perhaps, by these incessant miseries,
and not able to draw consolation from the sham splendour and tinselly
grandeur with which George Vane tried to invest his fallen state.
She died within five years of her marriage, leaving a distracted and
despairing old man as the sole guardian and protector of her only child.

This calamity was the bitterest blow that George Vane had ever been
called upon to endure. He had loved his second wife, the wife of his
poverty and humiliation, far more dearly than he had loved the obedient
partner of his splendour and prosperity. She had been more to him a
thousand times, this gentle girl who had so uncomplainingly accepted
the hardships of her lot, because there had been no idle vanities, no
hollow glories, no Princes and Beefsteak Clubs, to stand between him
and his love of her.

She was lost, and he remembered how little he had done to prove
his affection for her. _She_ had never reproached him; no word of
upbraiding had ever crossed those tender lips. But how did he know
that he had not wronged her as cruelly as he had wronged those noisy
children who had betrayed and deserted him?

He remembered how often he had slighted her advice, her loving counsel,
so pure and true, so modestly offered, so gently spoken. He remembered
how many humiliations he had forced upon her, how many falsehoods he
had compelled her to tell; how often he had imposed upon her affection,
suffering her to slave for him in his blind selfishness.

He could remember all these things now that she was gone, and that it
was too late; too late to fall at her feet and tell her that he was all
unworthy of her love and goodness; too late to offer her even such poor
atonement for the past as penitence and tears. A hundred tokens of her
in his poor lodgings recalled her a hundred times a day, bringing the
tears into this poor broken-down mourner’s eyes.

He did not need the presence of his little daughter, whose dark grey
eyes looked at him like hers, whose auburn hair had the same golden
glory that he had so often seen glistening in the sunshine as he sat
lazily watching the low evening light upon his wife’s drooping head.
It seemed only yesterday that she had stood in the window working for
him—for him.

His affliction left him for a long time a broken old man. He did not
care in this dull interval of despair to keep up those outward shams
of prosperity which he had so persistently preserved. His fashionable
coats and boots, treasured so carefully of late, were no longer
objects of tender care and delight to him. He ceased to go out into
that ignorant and careless world in which he could still play the fine
gentleman. He shut himself up and abandoned himself to his grief, and
it was a long time before his frivolous nature recovered the shock
he had suffered. It is not to be wondered at that, in the agony of
his bereavement, his youngest child became unspeakably dear to him.
He had severed all the links which had bound him to the past, and to
his elder children. His second marriage had made a new era in his
life. If he thought of these elder children at all, it was only to
remember that some of them were living in luxury, and that they ought
to support him in his penniless old age. If he wrote to them, he wrote
begging-letters, appealing to them in exactly the same spirit as he
might have appealed to the Duke of Wellington or Miss Burdett Coutts.

Yes; his youngest daughter usurped the place of an only child in the
old man’s heart. He indulged her as he had indulged the ungrateful
elder children. He could not give her carriages and horses, liveried
servants and splendid houses, but he could now and then prevail upon
some weak-minded creditor to trust him, and would come home triumphant
to his shabby lodging, bearing spoils for his beloved Eleanor. He
would hire a brougham from a confiding livery-stable keeper, and would
take his little girl for a drive in the country. He would get her fine
dresses from the silk-mercers who had supplied his elder daughters,
and he would compensate her for the shabby miseries of her every-day
existence by chance flashes of radiance and glory.

Then, again, he would very often obtain small sums of money, loans from
private friends, it may be, or fleeting treasures from a mysterious
source, of which his innocent little daughter had no knowledge. So, for
the first ten or eleven years of her life, Miss Vane’s existence was
chequered by sudden glimpses of abnormal wealth—wonderful feast days
of luxury and extravagance—which contrasted sharply with the dreary
poverty of her ordinary experiences.

Thus it was no uncommon thing for this young lady to dine to-day in a
tawdry and rather dirty parlour at Chelsea upon tea and red-herrings,
and to-morrow to sit opposite her father in one of the sunny windows
at the Crown and Sceptre, eating whitebait with the calm enjoyment of
a connoisseur, and looking placidly on while Mr. Vane gave himself
ducal airs to the waiters, and found fault with the icing of his
sparkling hock. There was scarcely any extravagance which this little
girl had not seen her father perpetrate. She had received from him a
birthday present of a two-guinea wax doll, at the very time at which
her schooling account, at a certain humble little seminary near Cheyne
Walk, remained unpaid, and her education was brought to a dead-lock by
reason of this default. She had sighed for that golden-haired waxen
plaything, and her father gave it to her because he loved her as he had
always loved, weakly and foolishly.

She loved him in return: repaying him a hundredfold for his affection
by her innocent love and trust. To her he was all that was perfect,
all that was noble and generous. The big talk, the glowing and
sentimental discourse by which he was wont to impose upon himself,
imposed upon her. She believed in that fancy portrait which he painted
of himself, and which he himself believed in as a most faithful and
unflattered likeness. She believed in that highly-coloured picture,
and thought that George Mowbray Vandeleur Vane was indeed what he
represented himself, and thought himself to be,—an injured old man, a
sainted martyr to the forgetfulness of the world, and the ingratitude
of his children.

Poor Eleanor was never weary of listening to her father’s stories about
the Prince Regent, and all the lesser planets of the darkened sky in
which Mr. Vane’s light had once shone. She used to walk in the park
with the old man in the sunny summer evenings, proud to see him bow
to great people, who returned his recognition with friendly courtesy.
She liked to fancy him in the days that were gone, riding side by side
with those mighty ones of the earth, whom he was now content to watch
wistfully across the iron railings. She was pleased to stroll about
the West End in the dusky gloaming of the soft May night, and to look
up at the lights in that princely mansion in Berkeley Square which
George Vane had once occupied. He showed her the windows which had
belonged to this and that apartment; the drawing-room; the first Mrs.
Vane’s boudoir; the little girls’ nursery and morning-room. She fancied
all those fairy chambers radiant with light and splendour; and then
remembering the shabby rooms at Chelsea, clung closer to her father’s
arm, in her tender sorrow for his fallen state.

But she had inherited much of George Vane’s sanguine temperament, and
almost as firm as her belief in the past, which had been a reality,
was her confidence in the splendid future which her father hoped in.
Nothing could have been more shadowy than the foundations upon which
Mr. Vane had built for himself an airy castle. In his youth and middle
age his most intimate friend and companion had been a certain Maurice
de Crespigny, the owner of a noble estate in Berkshire, and _not_ a
friend of the Prince Regent’s. So, while George Vane’s two estates
had melted away, and his three fortunes had been expended, Mr. de
Crespigny, who was an invalid and a bachelor, had contrived to keep his
land and his money.

There was only the difference of two or three years between the ages of
the two friends. I believe that Maurice de Crespigny was the younger of
the two. And it was during their early college life that the young men
had entered into a romantic alliance, very chivalrous and honourable in
its nature, but scarcely likely to stand the wear and tear of worldly
experience.

They were to be friends through life and until death. They were
to have no secrets from each other. If by any chance they should
happen to fall in love with the same person—and I really think these
sentimental collegians rather wished that such a contingency might
arise—one of them, the most noble, the most heroic, was quietly to fall
back and suffer in silence, while the weaker won the prize. If either
died a bachelor, he was to leave his fortune to the other, whatever
less romantic and more commonplace claimants, in the way of heirs
presumptive, might press upon him.

These vows had been made at least five-and-forty years ago, but out
of this folly of the past George Vane built his hope in the future.
Maurice de Crespigny was now a soured and hypochondriacal old bachelor,
shut in and defended on every side by greedy and sycophantic relations,
and utterly unapproachable to his shabby old bosom friend; who could
as easily have made his way out of one of the lowest dungeons of the
Bastille as he could force an entrance into that closely-guarded
citadel within which his college companion sat, lonely and dismal,
a desolate old man, watched over by sharp eyes, greedily noteful of
every token of his decay, ministered to by hands that would have worked
eagerly at his winding-sheet, if by so doing they could have hastened
the hour of his death.

If George Vane—remembering his old friend, perhaps, with some latent
feeling of tenderness intermingled with his mercenary hopes—made an
effort to penetrate the cruel barriers about him, he was repulsed with
ignominy by the two maiden nieces who kept watch and ward at Woodlands.
If he wrote to Mr. de Crespigny, his missive was returned unopened,
with a satirical intimation that the dear invalid’s health was not in a
state to endure the annoyance of begging letters. He had made a hundred
attempts to cross the lines of the enemy, and had been mortified by a
hundred failures; but his sanguine nature was not to be subdued by any
humiliation, and he still believed, firmly and entirely, that whenever
Maurice de Crespigny’s will came to be opened, his name, and his alone,
would appear as sole heir to his old friend’s wealth. He forgot that
Maurice de Crespigny was his junior by some two or three years; for
he had always heard of him of late as a feeble invalid, tottering
upon the verge of the grave; while he himself was erect and stalwart,
broad-chested and soldierly-looking; so very soldierly in appearance
that the sentinels on guard in the park were wont to salute him as he
passed them, mistaking him for some military magnate.

Yes, he believed the day would come when poor De Crespigny—he always
spoke of his friend with a certain pitiful tenderness—would drop
quietly into his grave, and when _he_ would reign at Woodlands with
his darling Eleanor, avenging himself upon his ungrateful elder
children, reopening accounts with his old creditors—in all his visions
of grandeur and patronage he never thought of paying his debts——and
arising from the dull ashes of his poverty, a splendid phœnix,
golden-plumed and exultant.

He taught his daughter this belief as religiously as he taught her the
simple prayers which she said nightly at his knee. With all his faults
he was no unbeliever, though the time which he devoted to religious
observances made a very small portion of his existence. He taught
Eleanor to believe in the day that was to come, and the little girl
saw the light of future splendour gleaming athwart the dreary swamp of
difficulty through which she waded patiently by her father’s side.

But the day came when George Vane and his child were to be separated,
for a time at least. Eleanor’s twelfth birthday was very near at
hand, and she had as yet received no better education than the rather
limited course of instruction which was to be obtained for a guinea and
a half a quarter at the day-school near Cheyne Walk. For nearly six
years, inclusive of many intervals of non-attendance consequent upon
non-payment, Miss Vane had frequented this humble seminary, in company
with the daughters of the butchers and bakers and the other plebeian
inhabitants of the district. But by the time she was twelve years old
the various sources from which her father’s very desultory income had
been drawn had one by one run dry and failed him. The weakest and most
long-suffering of his creditors had crossed his name out of their
ledgers, his friends had ceased to believe in the fiction of delayed
remittances, urgent temporary need, and early repayment; and he could
no longer count upon an occasional five-pound note when the Chelsea
landlady became clamorous, and the Chelsea general dealer refused to
send home another ounce of tea, except on payment of ready money.

A desperate crisis had come, and in his despair the old man forgot
his pride. For Eleanor’s sake, if not for his own, he must endure
humiliation. He must appeal to his eldest daughter, the hard-hearted
but wealthy Hortensia Bannister, who had lost her stockbroker husband
a twelvemonth before, and was now a rich and childless widow. Yes—he
wiped the tears of humiliation away from his faded cheeks as he arrived
at this resolution—he would try and forget the past, and would take
Eleanor with him to Hyde Park Gardens, and appeal to her cruel sister
in her behalf. His determination was speedily carried out, for he went
to work with something of that desperate courage which a condemned
criminal may feel when he goes to execution; and one sunny morning
early in the June of 1850, he and his daughter sat in Mrs. Bannister’s
handsome drawing-room, fearfully awaiting the advent of that lady. She
came to them after a very brief delay, for she was business-like and
uncompromising in her habits, and she had been prepared for this visit
by a long, pitiful, explanatory letter from her father, in reply to
which she had written very coldly and concisely, appointing an early
interview.

She was a severe-looking woman of about five-and-thirty, with a hard
face, and heavy black eyebrows, which met over her handsome aquiline
nose when she frowned, which she did a great deal too often, poor
Eleanor thought. Her features were like those of her father, but her
grim and stony expression was entirely her own, and was perhaps the
result of that early and bitter disappointment of finding herself a
portionless girl, deserted by the man she loved, who fell away from her
when he discovered the state of her father’s fortunes, and compelled
to marry for money, or to accept the wretched alternative of a life of
poverty and drudgery.

This harsh disappointed woman affected no pretence of tender feeling
for her half-sister. Perhaps the sight of Eleanor’s childish beauty was
scarcely pleasant to her. She herself had drawn a dreary blank in the
great lottery of life, in spite of her wealth; and she may have envied
this child her unknown future, which could not well be so dismal as the
childless widow’s empty existence.

But Mrs. Bannister was a religious woman, and tried to do her duty in
a hard, uncompromising way, in which good works were not beautified
by any such flimsy adornments as love and tenderness. So when she
heard that her father lived from day to day a wretched hand-to-mouth
existence, haunted by the grim phantom of starvation, she was seized
with a sudden sense that she had been very wicked to this weak old
man, and she agreed to allow him a decent pittance, which would enable
him to live about as comfortably as a half-pay officer or a small
annuitant. She made this concession sternly enough, and lectured her
father so severely that he may be perhaps forgiven if he was not
very grateful for his daughter’s bounty, so far as he himself went;
but he did make a feeble protestation of his thankfulness when Mrs.
Bannister further declared her willingness to pay a certain premium, in
consideration of which Eleanor Vane might be received in a respectable
boarding-school as an apprentice or pupil-teacher.

It was thus that the little girl became acquainted with the Misses
Bennett, of Wilmington House, Brixton; and it was in the household
of these ladies that three years of her life had been passed. Three
quiet and monotonous years of boarding-school drudgery, which had only
been broken by two brief visits to her father, who had taken up his
abode in Paris; where he lived secure from the persecution of a few
of his latter-day creditors—not the west-end tradesmen who had known
him in his prime, _they_ were resigned and patient enough under their
losses—but a few small dealers who had trusted him in his decline, and
who were not rendered lenient by the memory of former profits.

In Paris, Mr. Vane had very little chance of obtaining any information
about his friend Maurice de Crespigny, but he still looked forward
confidently to that visionary future in which he was to be master of
the Woodlands estate. He had taken care to write a letter, soon after
Eleanor’s birth, which had been artfully conveyed to his friend,
announcing the advent of this youngest child, and dwelling much on his
love for her. He cherished some vague notion that, in the event of his
death occurring before that of Maurice de Crespigny, the old man might
leave his wealth to Eleanor. The contumely with which, he had been
treated by the maiden harpies who kept watch over his old friend had
been pleasant to him rather than otherwise, for in the anger of these
elderly damsels he saw an evidence of their fear.

“If they knew that poor Crespigny’s money was left to them, they
wouldn’t be so savage,” he thought. “It’s evident they’re by no means
too confident about the future.”

But there were other relatives of the old man’s, less fortunate than
the maiden sisters, who had found their way into the citadel, and
planted themselves _en permanence_ at Woodlands. There was a married
niece, who had once been a beauty. This lady had been so foolish as to
marry against her rich uncle’s wishes, and was now a widow, living in
the neighbourhood of Woodlands upon an income of two hundred a year.
This lady’s only son, Launcelot Darrell, had in his boyhood been a
favourite with the old man, and was known to cherish expectations about
Maurice de Crespigny’s fortune. But the maiden sisters were patient and
indefatigable women. No sacred fire was ever watched more carefully by
classic vestal than was the ireful flame which burned in Maurice de
Crespigny’s heart when he remembered his married niece’s ingratitude
and disobedience. The unwearying old maids kept his indignation alive
by every feminine subtlety, by every diplomatic device. Heaven knows
what they wanted with their uncle’s money, for they were prim damsels,
who wore stuff shoes and scanty dresses made in the fashion of their
youth. They had outlived the very faculty of enjoyment, and their wants
were almost as simple as those of the robins that perched upon their
window-sills; but for all this they were as eager to become possessors
of the old man’s wealth as the most heartless and spendthrift heir,
tormented by Israelitish creditors, and subsisting entirely upon post
obits.




CHAPTER IV.

UPON THE THRESHOLD OF A GREAT SORROW.


It was nearly noon when Eleanor Vane awoke upon the morning after her
journey; for this young lady was a good sleeper, and was taking her
revenge for four-and-twenty hours of wakefulness. I doubt, indeed, if
she would have opened her eyes when she did, had not her father tapped
at the door of her tiny chamber and told her the hour.

She woke smiling, like a beautiful infant who has always seen loving
eyes watching above its cradle.

“Papa, darling,” she cried, “is it you? I’ve just been dreaming that I
was at Brixton. How delightful to wake and hear your voice! I won’t be
long, papa dear. But you haven’t waited breakfast all this time, have
you?”

“No, my dear. I have a cup of coffee and a roll brought me every
morning at nine from a _traiteur’s_ over the way. I’ve ordered some
breakfast for you, but I wouldn’t wake you till twelve. Dress quickly,
Nell. It’s a lovely morning, and I’ll take you for a walk.”

It was indeed a lovely morning. Eleanor Vane flung back the tawdry
damask curtains, and let the full glory of the August noontide sun
into her little room. Her window had been open all the night through,
and the entresol was so close to the street that she could hear the
conversation of the people upon the pavement below. The foreign jargon
sounded pleasant to her in its novelty. It was altogether different
to the French language as she had been accustomed to hear it at
Brixton; where a young lady forfeited a halfpenny every time she forgot
herself so far as to give utterance to her thoughts or desires in the
commonplace medium of her mother tongue. The merry voices, the barking
of dogs, the rattling of wheels, and ringing of bells in the distance,
mingled in a cheerful clamour.

As Eleanor Vane let in that glorious noontide sunlight, it seemed to
her that she had let in the morning of a new life; a new and happier
existence, brighter and pleasanter than the dull boarding-school
monotony she had had so much of.

Her pure young soul rejoiced in the sunshine, the strange city, the
change, the shadowy hopes that beckoned to her in the future, the
atmosphere of love which her father’s presence always made in the
shabbiest home. She had not been unhappy at Brixton, because it was
her nature to be happy under difficulties, because she was a bright,
spontaneous creature, to whom it was almost impossible to be sorrowful:
but she had looked forward yearningly to this day, in which she was to
join her father in Paris, never perhaps to go far away from him again.
And it had come at last, this long-hoped-for day, the sunny opening of
a new existence. It had come; and even the heavens had sympathy with
her gladness, and wore their fairest aspect in honour of this natal day
of her new life.

She did not linger long over her toilet, though she lost a good deal
of time in unpacking her box—which had not been very neatly packed,
by the way—and had considerable trouble in finding hair-brushes and
combs, cuffs, collars, and ribbons, and all the rest of the small
paraphernalia with which she wished to decorate herself.

But when she emerged at last, radiant and smiling, with her long golden
hair falling in loose curls over her shoulders, and her pale muslin
dress adorned with fluttering blue ribbons, her father was fain to cry
out aloud at the sight of his darling’s beauty. She kissed him a dozen
times, but took very little notice of his admiration—she seemed, in
fact, scarcely conscious that he did admire her—and then ran into the
adjoining room to caress a dog, an eccentric French poodle, which had
been George Vane’s faithful companion during the three years he had
spent in Paris.

“Oh, papa!” Eleanor cried joyously, returning to the sitting-room with
the dingy white animal in her arms, “I am so pleased to find Fido. You
didn’t speak of him in your letters, and I was afraid you had lost him,
perhaps, or that he was dead. But here he is, just as great a darling,
and just as dirty as ever.”

The poodle, who was divided in half, upon that unpleasant principle
common to his species, and who was white and curly in front, and smooth
and pinky behind, reciprocated Miss Vane’s caresses very liberally. He
leaped about her knees when she set him down upon the slippery floor,
and yelped wild outcries of delight. He was not permitted to pass the
night in Mr. Vane’s apartments, but slept in a dismal outhouse behind
the butcher’s shop, and it was thus that Eleanor had not seen him upon
her arrival in the Rue de l’Archevêque.

The young lady was so anxious to go out with her father, so eager
to be away on the broad boulevards with the happy idle people of
that wonderful city in which nobody ever seems to be either busy or
sorrowful, that she made very short work of her roll and coffee,
and then ran back to her little bed-chamber to array herself for a
promenade. She came out five minutes afterwards dressed in a black
silk mantle and a white transparent bonnet, which looked fleecy and
cloud-like against her bright auburn hair. That glorious hair was
suffered to fall from under the bonnet and stream about her shoulders
like golden rain, for she had never yet attained the maturer dignity of
wearing her luxuriant tresses plaited and twisted in a hard knot at
the back of her head.

“Now papa, please, where are we to go?”

“Wherever you like, my darling,” the old man answered; “I mean to give
you a treat to-day. You shall spend the morning how you like, and
we’ll dine on the Boulevard Poissonnier. I’ve received a letter from
Mrs. Bannister. It came before you were up. I am to call in the Rue de
la Paix for a hundred and six pounds. A hundred to be paid to Madame
Marly, and six for me; my monthly allowance, my dear, at the rate of
thirty shillings a week.”

Mr. Vane sighed as he named the sum. It would have been better for this
broken-down old spendthrift if he could have received his pittance
weekly, or even daily; for it was his habit to dine at the Trois
Frères, and wear pale straw-coloured gloves, and a flower in his
button-hole, at the beginning of the month, and to subsist on rolls and
coffee towards its close.

He unfolded the narrow slip of paper upon which his eldest daughter
had written the banker’s address and the amount which Mr. Vane was to
demand, and looked at the magical document fondly, almost proudly.
Any one unfamiliar with his frivolous and sanguine nature, might have
wondered at the change which had taken place in his manner since the
previous night, when he had tearfully bewailed his daughter’s cruelty.

He had been an old man then, degraded, humiliated, broken down by
sorrow and shame: to-day he was young, handsome, gay, defiant, pompous,
prepared to go out into the world and hold his place amongst the
butterflies once more. He rejoiced in the delicious sensation of having
money to spend. Every fresh five-pound note was a new lease of youth
and happiness to George Vane.

The father and daughter went out together, and the butcher neglected
his business in order to stare after Miss Vane; and the butcher’s
youngest child, a tiny damsel in a cambric mob-cap, cried out, “Oh,
la belle demoiselle!” as Eleanor turned the corner of the narrow
street into the sunny thoroughfare beyond. Fido came frisking after
his master’s daughter, and Mr. Vane had some difficulty in driving the
animal back. Eleanor would have liked the dog to go with them in their
noontide ramble through the Parisian streets, but her father pointed
out the utter absurdity of such a proceeding.

Mr. Vane conducted his daughter through a maze of streets behind
the Madeleine. There was no Boulevard Malesherbes in those days, to
throw this part of the city open to the sweep of a park of artillery.
Eleanor’s eyes lit up with gladness as they emerged from the narrower
streets behind the church into the wide boulevard, not as handsome
then as it is to-day, but very broad and airy, gay and lightsome withal.

An involuntary cry of delight broke from Eleanor’s lips.

“Oh, papa,” she said, “it is so different from Brixton. But where are
we going first, papa, dear?”

“Over the way, my dear, to Blount and Co.’s, in the Rue de la Paix.
We’ll get this money at once, Nelly, and we’ll carry it straight to
Madame Marly. They had no occasion to insult us, my dear. We have not
sunk so low, yet. No, no, not quite so low as to rob our own children.”

“Papa, darling, don’t think of that cruel letter. I don’t like to take
the money when I remember that. Don’t think of it, papa.”

Mr. Vane shook his head.

“I _will_ think of it, my dear,” he answered, in a tone of sorrowful
indignation—the indignation of an honourable man, who rebels against a
cruel stigma of dishonour. “I will think of it, Eleanor. I have been
called a thief—a thief, Eleanor. I am not very likely to forget _that_,
I think.”

They were in the Rue de la Paix by this time. George Vane was very
familiar with the banker’s office, for he had been in the habit of
receiving his monthly pension through an order on Messrs. Blount and
Co. He left Eleanor at the foot of the stairs, while he ascended to the
office on the first floor; and he returned five minutes afterwards,
carrying a bundle of notes in one hand, and a delicious little roll of
napoleons in the other. The notes fluttered pleasantly in the summer
air, as he showed them to his daughter.

“We will go at once to Madame Marly, my darling,” he said, gaily, “and
give her these, without a moment’s unnecessary delay. They shall have
no justification in calling me a thief, Eleanor. You will write to your
sister by this afternoon’s post, perhaps, my dear, and tell her that I
did not try to rob you. I think you owe so much as that to your poor
old father.”

George Vane’s daughter clung lovingly to his arm, looking up tenderly
and entreatingly in his face.

“Papa, darling, how can you say such things?” she cried. “I will write
and tell Mrs. Bannister that she has been very cruel, and that her
insulting letter has made me hate to take her paltry money. But, papa,
dearest, how can you talk of robbing _me_? If this money is really
mine, take it; take every penny of it, if—if—you owe it to anybody who
worries you; or if you want it for anything in the world. I can go back
to Brixton and earn my living to-morrow, papa. Miss Bennett and Miss
Sophia told me so before I came away. You don’t know how useful they
began to find me with the little ones. Take the money, papa, dear, if
you want it.”

Mr. Vane turned upon his daughter with almost tragic indignation.

“Eleanor,” he said, “do you know me so little that you dare to insult
me by such a proposition as this? No; if I were starving I would not
take this money. Am I so lost and degraded that even the child I love
turns upon me in my old age?”

The hand which held the bank notes trembled with passionate emotion as
the old man spoke.

“Papa, darling,” Eleanor pleaded, “indeed, indeed, I did not mean to
wound you.”

“Let me hear no more of this, then, Eleanor; let me hear no more of
it,” answered Mr. Vane, drawing himself up with a dignity that would
have become a classic toga, rather than the old man’s fashionable
overcoat. “I am not angry with you, my darling; I was only hurt, I was
only hurt. My children have never known me, Eleanor; they have never
known me. Come, my dear.”

Mr. Vane put aside his tragic air, and plunged into the Rue St. Honoré,
where he called for a packet of gloves that had been cleaned for him.
He put the gloves in his pocket, and then strolled back into the Rue
Castiglione, looking at the vehicles in the roadway as he went. He was
waiting to select the most elegantly appointed of the hackney equipages
crawling slowly past.

“It’s a pity the government insist on putting a painted badge upon
them,” he said, thoughtfully. “When I last called on Madame Marly,
Charles the Tenth was at the Tuileries, and I had my travelling chariot
and pair at Meurice’s, besides a britska for Mrs. Vane.”

He had pitched upon a very new and shining vehicle, with a smart
coachman, by this time, and he made that half hissing, half whistling
noise peculiar to Parisians when they call a hackney carriage.

Eleanor sprang lightly into the vehicle, and spread her flowing muslin
skirts upon the cushions as she seated herself. The passers-by looked
admiringly at the smiling young Anglaise with her white bonnet and
nimbus of glittering hair.

“Au Bois, cocher,” Mr. Vane cried, as he took his place by his daughter.

He had bought a tiny bouquet for his button-hole near the Madeleine,
and he selected a pair of white doeskin gloves, and drew them carefully
on his well-shaped hands. He was as much a dandy to-day as he had been
in those early days when the Prince and Brummel were his exalted models.

The drive across the Place de la Concorde, and along the Champs
Elysées, was an exquisite pleasure to Eleanor Vane; but it was even
yet more exquisite when the light carriage rolled away along one of
the avenues in the Bois de Boulogne, where the shadows of the green
leaves trembled on the grass, and all nature rejoiced beneath the
cloudless August sky. The day was a shade too hot, perhaps, and had
been certainly growing hotter once noon, but Eleanor was too happy to
remember that.

“How nice it is to be with you, papa darling,” she said, “and how
I wish I wasn’t going to this school. I should be so happy in that
dear little lodging over the butcher’s, and I could go out as morning
governess to some French children, couldn’t I? I shouldn’t cost you
much, I know, papa.”

Mr. Vane shook his head.

“No, no, my love. Your education must be completed. Why should you be
less accomplished than your sisters? You shall occupy as brilliant a
position as ever they occupied, my love, or a better one, perhaps. You
have seen me under a cloud, Eleanor; but you shall see the sunshine
yet. You’ll scarcely know your old father, my poor girl, when you see
him in the position he has been used to occupy; yes, used to occupy,
my dear. This lady we are going to see, Madame Marly, _she_ remembers,
my love. She could tell you what sort of a man George Vane was
five-and-twenty years ago.”

The house in which the fashionable schoolmistress who had “finished”
the elder daughters of George Vane still received her pupils, was a
white-walled villa, half-hidden in one of the avenues of the Bois de
Boulogne.

The little hired carriage drew up before a door in the garden wall, and
a portress came out to reply to the coachman’s summons.

Unhappily, the portress said, Madame was not at home. Madame’s
assistants were at home, and would be happy to receive Monsieur and
Mademoiselle. That might be perhaps altogether the same thing, the
portress suggested.

No, Monsieur replied, he must see Madame herself. Ah, but then nothing
could be so unfortunate. Madame, who so seldom quitted the Pension, had
to-day driven into Paris to arrange her affairs, and would not return
until sunset.

Mr. Vane left his card with a few words written upon it in pencil,
to the effect that he would call at two o’clock the next day, in the
charge of the portress: and the carriage drove back towards Paris.

“Bear witness, Eleanor,” said the old man, “bear witness that I tried
to pay this money away immediately after receiving it. You will be good
enough to mention that fact in your letter to my eldest daughter.”

He had carried the notes in his hand all this time, as if eager to
deliver them over to the schoolmistress, but he now put them into
his breast-pocket. I think upon the whole he was rather pleased at
the idea of retaining custody of the money for the next twenty-four
hours. It was not his own, but the mere possession of it gave him a
pleasant sense of importance; and, again, he might very probably have
an opportunity of displaying the bank notes, incidentally, to some of
his associates. Unhappily for this lonely old man, his few Parisian
acquaintances were of a rather shabby and not too reputable a calibre,
and were therefore likely to be somewhat impressed by the sight of a
hundred and twenty-five napoleons, in crisp, new notes upon the Bank of
France.

It was past three when Mr. Vane and his daughter alighted in front of
the Palais Royal, and the coachman claimed payment for two hours and
a-half. The old man had changed the first of his six napoleons at the
glove-cleaner’s, and he had a handful of loose silver in his waistcoat
pocket, so the driver was quickly paid and dismissed, and Eleanor
entered the Palais Royal, that paradise of cheap jewellery and dinners,
hanging on her father’s arm.

Mr. Vane bore patiently with his daughter’s enthusiastic admiration
of the diamonds and the paste, the glittering realities and almost as
glittering shams in the jewellers’ windows. Eleanor wanted to look at
everything, the trinkets, and opera-glasses, and portmanteaus, and
china,—everything was new and beautiful. The fountain was playing;
noisy children were running about, amongst equally noisy nurses and
idle loungers. A band was playing close to the fountain. The chinking
of tea-spoons, and cups and saucers, sounded in the Café de la Rotonde:
people had not begun to dine yet, but the windows and glazed nooks in
the doorways of the restaurants were splendid with their displays of
gigantic melons, and dewy purple grapes, cucumbers, pears, tomatoes,
and peaches. George Vane allowed his daughter to linger a long time
before all the shops. He was rather ashamed of her exuberant delight,
and unrestrained enthusiasm; for so much pleasure in these simple
things was scarcely consistent with that _haut ton_ which the old man
still affected, even in his downfall. But he had not the heart to
interfere with his daughter’s happiness—was it not strange happiness to
_him_ to have this beautiful creature with him, clinging to his arm,
and looking up at him with a face that was glorified by her innocent
joy?

They left the Palais Royal at last, before half its delights were
exhausted, as Eleanor thought, and went through the Rue Richelieu
to the Place de la Bourse, where Mr. Vane’s eager companion looked
wistfully at the doors of the theatre opposite the great Temple of
Commerce.

“Oh, papa,” she said, “how I should like to go to a theatre to-night!”

Miss Vane had seen a good deal of the English drama during her Chelsea
life, for the old man knew some of the London managers, men who
remembered him in his prosperity, and were glad to give him admission
to their boxes now and then, out of pure benevolence. But the Parisian
theatres seemed mysteriously delightful to Eleanor, inasmuch as they
were strange.

“Can you get tickets for the theatres here, papa,” she asked, “as you
used in London?”

Mr. Vane shrugged his shoulders.

“No, my love,” he said, “it’s not quite such an easy matter. I know a
man who writes farces now and then for the Funambules—a very clever
fellow—but he doesn’t get many orders to give away, and that’s not
exactly the theatre I should like to take you to. I’ll tell you what,
though, Eleanor, I’ll take you to the Porte St. Martin to-night—why
should I deny my child an innocent pleasure? I’ll take you to the Porte
St. Martin, unless——”

George Vane paused, and a gloomy shadow crept over his face—a shade
that made him look an old man. His youthfulness of appearance entirely
depended upon the buoyancy of a nature which contended with age. The
moment his spirits sank he looked what he was—an old man.

“Unless what, papa, dearest?” Eleanor asked.

“I—I had an appointment to-night, my love, with—with a couple of
gentlemen who——But I won’t keep it, Eleanor,—no, no, I’ll not keep it.
I’ll take you to the theatre. I can afford you that pleasure.”

“Dear, dear papa, you never refuse me any pleasure; but it would be
so selfish of me to ask you to break your appointment with these two
gentlemen. You had better keep it.”

“No, no, my dear—I’d—it would be better—perhaps. Yes, I’ll take you to
the Porte St. Martin.”

Mr. Vane spoke hesitatingly. The shadow had not yet left his face. Had
his daughter been less occupied by the delights of the Parisian shops,
the novelty and gaiety of the crowd, she must surely have observed the
change in that idolized father.

But she observed nothing, she could remember nothing but her happiness.
This glorious day of reunion and delight seemed, indeed, the beginning
of a new life. She looked back wonderingly at the dull routine of her
boarding-school existence. Could it be possible that it was only a day
or two since she was in the Brixton school-room hearing the little
ones—the obstinate, incorrigible little ones—their hateful lessons:
their odious monotonous repetition of dry facts about William the
Conqueror and Buenos Ayres, the manufacture of tallow candles, and the
nine parts of speech?

They strolled on the boulevard till six o’clock, and then ascended the
shining staircase of a restaurant on the Boulevard Poissonnier, where
Eleanor saw herself reflected in so many mirrors that she was almost
bewildered by the repetition of her own auburn hair and white bonnet.

The long saloons were filled with eager diners, who looked up from
their knives and forks as the English girl went by.

“We dine à la carte here,” her father whispered: “this is a fête day,
and I mean to give you a first-class dinner.”

Mr. Vane found a vacant table in an open window. The house was at
a corner of the boulevard, and this window looked down the crowded
thoroughfare towards the Madeleine. Eleanor exclaimed once more as the
prospect burst upon her, and she saw all the boulevard with its gay
splendour, spread out, as it were, at her feet; but her father was too
busy with the waiter and the _carte_ to observe her manifestation of
delight.

Mr. Vane was an epicure, and prided himself upon his talent for
ordering a dinner. There was a good deal of _finesse_ displayed by
him now-a-days in the arrangement of a repast; for poverty had taught
him all kinds of little diplomatic contrivances whereby he might, as
it were, mingle economy and extravagance. He ordered such and such
dishes for “one,” intending to divide them with his child. A few Ostend
oysters, some soup—_purée crécy_—a little dish of beef and olives,
a _sole normande_, a quarter of a roast chicken, and a _Charlotte
Plombières_.

It was a long time since Eleanor had eaten one of her father’s
epicurean feasts, and she did ample justice to the dinner, even in
spite of the ever recurrent distractions upon the boulevard below.

The dishes followed each other slowly, for the unresting waiters had
many claimants on their attention, and the sun was low in the cloudless
western sky when Mr. Vane and his daughter left the restaurant. It
was nearly night; the lights began to shine out through a hot white
mist, for the heat had grown more and more oppressive as the day
had declined. The Parisians sitting at little marble tables on the
pavement outside the cafés fanned themselves with their newspapers, and
drank effervescing drinks pertinaciously. It was a night upon which
one should have had nothing more laborious to do than to sit outside
Tortoni’s and eat ices.

The noise and clamour, the oppressive heat, the bustle and confusion
of the people rushing to the theatres, made Eleanor’s head ache. One
cannot go on being unutterably happy for ever, and perhaps the day’s
excitement had been almost too much for this young school-girl. She
had walked long distances already upon the burning asphalte of the
wonderful city, and she was beginning to be tired. Mr. Vane never
thought of this: he had been accustomed to walk about day after day,
and sometimes all day—for what should a lonely Englishman do in Paris
but walk about?—and he forgot that the fatigue might be too much for
his daughter. He walked on, therefore, with Eleanor still clinging
to his arm; past the Ambigu, beyond the Barrière St. Antoine; and
still the long lamplit boulevard stretched before them, away into
immeasurable distance, as it appeared to Miss Vane.

The hot, white mist seemed to grow denser as the evening advanced; the
red sun blazed and flashed on every available scrap of crystal; the
gas-lamps, newly illumined, strove against that setting sun. It was
all light, and heat, and noise, and confusion, Eleanor thought, upon
the boulevard. Very splendid, of course, but rather bewildering. She
would have been glad to sit down to rest upon one of the benches on the
edge of the pavement; but, as her father did not seem tired, she still
walked on, patiently and uncomplainingly.

“We’ll go into one of the theatres presently, Nelly,” Mr. Vane said.

He had recovered his spirits under the invigorating influence of a
bottle of Clicquot’s champagne, and the gloomy shadow had quite passed
away from his face.

It was nearly nine o’clock, and quite dark, when they turned towards
the Madeleine again, on the way back to the Porte St. Martin. They had
not gone far when Mr. Vane stopped, suddenly confronted by two young
men who were walking arm-in-arm.

“Hulloa!” one of them cried, in French, “you have served us a handsome
trick, my friend.”

George Vane stammered out an apology. His daughter had returned from
school, he said, and he wished to show her Paris.

“Yes, yes,” the Frenchman answered; “but we were aware of
Mademoiselle’s intended return, and it was arranged in spite of that
that we should meet this evening: was it not so, my friend?”

He asked this question of his companion, who nodded rather sulkily, and
turned away with a half weary, half dissatisfied air.

Eleanor looked at the two young men, wondering what new friends her
father had made in Paris. The Frenchman was short and stout, and had
a fair florid complexion. Eleanor was able to see this, for his face
was turned to the lamplight, as he talked to her father. He was rather
showily dressed, in fashionably cut clothes, that looked glossy and
new, and he twirled a short silver-headed cane in his gloved hands.

The other man was tall and slender, shabbily and untidily dressed in
garments of a rakish cut, that hung loosely about him. His hands were
thrust deep in the pockets of his loose overcoat, and his hat was
slouched over his forehead.

Eleanor Vane only caught one passing glimpse of this man’s face as he
turned sulkily away; but she could see the glimmer of a pair of bright,
restless, black eyes under the shadow of his hat, and the fierce
curve of a very thick black moustache, which completely concealed his
mouth. He had turned, not towards the lighted shop windows, but to the
roadway; and he was amusing himself by kicking a wisp of straw to and
fro upon the sharp edge of the curb-stone, with the toe of his shabby
patent leather boot.

The Frenchman drew George Vane aside, and talked to him for a few
minutes in an undertone, gesticulating after the manner of his nation,
and evidently persuading the old man to do something or other which he
shrank from doing. But Mr. Vane’s resistance seemed of a very feeble
nature, and the Frenchman conquered, for his last shrug was one of
triumph. Eleanor, standing by herself, midway between the sulky young
man upon the curb-stone and her father and the Frenchman, perceived
this. She looked up anxiously as Mr. Vane returned to her.

“My love,” the old man said, hesitatingly, nervously trifling with his
glove as he spoke, “do you think you could find your way back to the
Rue de l’Archevêque?”

“Find my way back? Why, papa?”

“I—I mean, could you find your way back a—alone?”

“Alone!”

She echoed the word with a look of mingled disappointment and alarm.

“Alone, papa?”

But here the Frenchman interposed eagerly.

Nothing was more simple, he said: Mademoiselle had only to walk
straight on to the Rue Neuve des Petits Champs; she would then, and
then——

He ran off into a string of rapid directions, not one of which Eleanor
heard. She was looking at her father, Heaven knows how earnestly, for
she saw in his face, in his nervous hesitating manner, something that
told her there was some sinister influence to be dreaded from this
garrulous, eager Frenchman and his silent companion.

“Papa, dear,” she said, in a low, almost imploring voice, “do you
really wish me to go back alone?”

“Why—why, you see, my dear, I—I don’t exactly wish—but there are
appointments which, as Monsieur remarks, not—not unreasonably, should
not be broken, and——”

“You will stay out late, papa, perhaps, with these gentlemen——”

“No, no, my love, no, no; for an hour or so; not longer.”

Eleanor looked up sorrowfully in the face she loved so dearly. Vague
memories of grief and trouble in the past, mingled with as vague a
presentiment of trouble in the future, filled her mind: she clasped her
hands imploringly upon her father’s arm.

“Come home with me to-night, papa,” she said. “It is my first night at
home. Come back, and we’ll play _écarté_ as we used at Chelsea. You
remember teaching me.”

Mr. Vane started, as if the tender grasp upon his arm had stung into
his flesh.

“I—I can’t come home to-night, Eleanor. At least, not for an hour.
There—there are social laws, my dear, which must be observed; and
when—when a gentleman is asked to give another his revenge, he—can’t
refuse. I’ll put you into a carriage, my darling, if you think you
can’t find your way.”

“Oh, no, papa, dear, it’s not that. I can find my way.”

The Frenchman here interposed for the second time with some
complimentary speech, addressed to Eleanor, who very imperfectly
understood its purport. He had slipped his arm through that of George
Vane, taking possession of him in a manner by that friendly gesture. In
all this time the other man had never stirred from his sulky attitude
upon the edge of the pavement.

Mr. Vane took his daughter’s hand.

“I am sorry I can’t take you to the theatre, my love,” he said, in the
same hesitating manner. “I—I regret that you should be disappointed,
but—good night, my dear, good night. I shall be home by eleven; but
don’t sit up for me; don’t on any account sit up.”

He pressed her hand, held it for a few moments, as if scarcely knowing
what to do with it, and then suddenly dropped it with something of a
guilty manner.

The Frenchman, with his arm still linked in the old man’s, wheeled
sharply round, and walked away towards the Barrière Saint Antoine,
leaving Eleanor standing alone amongst the passers-by, looking
wistfully after her father. The other man looked up as the Frenchman
led Mr. Vane away, and slowly followed them, with his head bent and his
hands in his pockets. Eleanor stood quite still, watching her father’s
erect figure, the short Frenchman, and the tall, sulky stranger
following the other two, until all three were out of sight. Then
turning homewards with a half-repressed sigh, she looked sadly down the
long lamplit vista. It was very beautiful, very gay, brilliant, and
splendid; but all that splendour and gaiety made her feel only the more
lonely, now that her father had left her. The first day, the natal day
of her new life, seemed to end very drearily, after all.




CHAPTER V.

WAITING.


Miss Vane walked very slowly homeward through the hot, breathless
summer night. She was too sorrowful, too much depressed by the sudden
disappointment which had fallen like a dark shadow upon the close
of the day that had begun so brightly, to be embarrassed by any
uncomfortable sense of her loneliness in the crowded thoroughfare.

No one molested or assailed her—she walked serene in her youth and
innocence; though the full radiance of the lamplight rarely fell upon
her face without some passing glance of admiration resting there also.
She never once thought that her father had done wrong in leaving her to
walk alone through that crowded Parisian street. In the unselfishness
of her loving nature she scarcely remembered her disappointment about
the theatre: not even when she passed the brilliantly lighted edifice,
and looked, a little wistfully perhaps, at the crowd upon the threshold.

She was uneasy and unhappy about her father, because in all her Chelsea
experiences she remembered evil to have resulted from his going out
late at night; vague and mysterious trouble, the nature of which he
had never revealed to her, but whose effects had haunted him and
depressed him for many dreary days. He had been sometimes—indeed, very
often—poorer after a late absence from his shabby Chelsea lodging; he
had been now and then richer; but he had always been alike remorseful
and miserable after those occasional nights of dissipation.

His daughter was sorrowful therefore at parting with him. She knew
that, in spite of his declaration that he would be home at eleven,
it would be between one and two in the morning when he returned;
not tipsy—no, thank Heaven, he was no drunkard—but with a nervous,
wretched, half-demented manner, which was perhaps more sad to see than
any ordinary intoxication.

“I was in hopes papa would always stay at home with me now that I am
grown up,” the young lady thought, very sadly. “When I was little, of
course it was different; I couldn’t amuse him. Though we were very
happy sometimes then; and I could play _écarté_, or cribbage, or whist
with two dummies. If I can get on very well with my education at Madame
Marly’s, and then get a situation as morning governess for a large
salary—morning governesses do get high salaries sometimes—how happy
papa and I might be!”

Her spirits revived under the influence of cheering thoughts each
as these. I have said before that it was scarcely possible for her
to be long unhappy. Her step grew lighter and faster as she walked
homeward. The glory of the gaslights brightened with the brightening
of her hopes. She began to linger now and then before some of the most
attractive of the shops, with almost the same intense rapture and
delight that she had felt in the morning.

She was standing before a book-stall, or rather an open shop, reading
the titles of the paper-covered romances, with the full glare of the
shadeless gaslights on her face, when she was startled by a loud,
hearty English voice, which exclaimed without one murmur of warning or
preparation,—

“Don’t tell me that this tall young woman with the golden curls is Miss
Eleanor Vandeleur Vane, of Regent’s Gardens, King’s Road, Chelsea,
London, Middlesex. Please don’t tell me anything of the kind, for I
can’t possibly believe anybody but Jack-and-the-beanstalk could have
grown at such a rate.”

Eleanor Vane turned round to greet this noisy gentleman.

“Oh, Dick,” she cried, putting both her hands into the broad palm held
out before her, “is it really you? Who would have thought of seeing you
in Paris?”

“Or you, Miss Vane? We heard you were at school at Brixton.”

“Yes, Dick,” the young lady answered, “but I have come home now. Papa
lives here, you know, and I am going to a finishing school in the Bois
de Boulogne, and then I am going to be a morning governess, and live
with papa always.”

“You are a great deal too pretty for a governess,” said the young man,
looking admiringly at the bright face lifted up to him; “your mistress
would snub you. Miss Vane, you’d better——”

“What, Dick?”

“Try our shop.”

“What, be a scene-painter, Dick?” cried Eleanor, laughing, “It would be
funny for a woman to be a scene-painter.”

“Of course, Miss Vane. But nobody talked of scene-painting. You don’t
suppose I’d ask you to stand on the top of a ladder to put in skies and
backgrounds, do you? There are other occupations at the Royal Waterloo
Phœnix besides scene-painting. But I don’t want to talk to you about
that: I know how savage your poor old dad used to be when we talked of
the Phœnix. What do you think I am over here for?”

“What, Richard?”

“Why, they’re doing a great drama in eight acts and thirty-two tableaux
at the Porte St. Martin; Raoul l’Empoisonneur it’s called, Ralph the
Poisoner; and I’m over here to pick up the music, sketch the scenery
and effects, and translate the play. Something like versatility there,
I think, for five-and-thirty shillings a week.”

“Dear Richard, you were always so clever.”

“To be sure; it runs in the family.”

“And the Signora, she is well, I hope?”

“Pretty well; the teaching goes on _tant bon que mauvais_, as our
friends over here say. The Clementi is a little thinner in tone than
when you heard it last, and a little farther off concert pitch; but as
most of my aunt’s pupils sing flat, that’s rather an advantage than
otherwise. But where are you going, Miss Vane? because wherever it
is, I’d better see you there. If we stand before this book-stall any
longer, the proprietor may think we’re going to buy something, and as
the Parisians don’t seem a buying people, the delusion might be too
much for his nerves. Where shall I take you, Miss Vane?”

“To the Rue de l’Archevêque, if you please, behind the Madeleine. Do
you know it?”

“Better than I know myself, Miss V. The Signora lived in that direction
when I was a boy. But how is it that you are all alone in the streets
at this time of night?”

“Papa had an appointment with two gentlemen, and he——”

“And he left you to walk home alone. Then he still——”

“Still what, Richard?”

The young man had stopped hesitatingly, and looked furtively at Eleanor.

“He still stays out late at night sometimes: a bad habit, Miss Vane. I
was in hopes he would have been cured of it by this time; especially
as there are no dens in the Palais Royal now-a-days; to the honour and
glory of Napoleon the Third be it spoken.”

“No dens in the Palais Royal,” cried Eleanor. “What do you mean?”

“Nothing, my dear Miss Nelly, except that Paris used to be a very wild
and wicked place.”

“But it isn’t now?”

“Oh dear, no. Our modern Lutetia is a very paradise of innocent
delights, whose citizens enjoy themselves virtuously under the
sheltering dictatorialism of a paternal government. You don’t
understand me—well, never mind, you are still the bright-faced child
you were in the King’s Road, Chelsea, only taller and prettier—that’s
all.”

Miss Vane had taken her companion’s arm, and they were walking away
towards the Madeleine by this time; the young lady clinging to her new
friend almost as confidingly as she had done to her father.

I don’t think the confidence was misplaced. This young man, with
the loud voice and the somewhat reckless manner, was only assistant
scene-painter and second violin-player at a transpontine theatre. He
was bound by no tie of relationship to the beautiful girl hanging
upon his arm. Indeed, his acquaintance with Mr. Vane and his daughter
had been of that accidental and desultory kind out of which the
friendships of poor people generally arise.

The young man had lodged with his aunt in the same house that for
nearly six years had sheltered the proud old spendthrift and his
motherless child, and some of Eleanor’s earliest memories were of
Signora Picirillo and her nephew Richard Thornton. She had received
her first lessons upon the pianoforte from the kind Signora, whose
Neapolitan husband had died years and years before, leaving her nothing
but an Italian name, which looked very imposing at the top of the
circulars which the music-mistress was wont to distribute amongst her
pupils.

Richard Thornton, at eight-and-twenty, seemed a very elderly person in
the eyes of the school-girl of fifteen. She could remember him years,
and years, and years ago, as it seemed to her, sitting in his shirt
sleeves through the long summer afternoons, under the shadow of the
scarlet-runners in the little garden at Chelsea, smoking dirty clay
pipes and practising popular melodies upon his fiddle. Her father
had thought him a nuisance, and had been lofty and reserved in his
patronage of the young man; but to Eleanor, Dick had been the most
delightful of playfellows, the wisest of counsellors, the most learned
of instructors. Whatever Richard did, Miss Vane insisted upon also
doing, humbly following the genius she admired, with little toddling
steps, along the brilliant pathway his talents adorned.

I am afraid she had learned to play “God save the Queen,” and “Rory
O’More,” upon Richard’s violin before she had mastered Haydn’s
“Surprise,” or “Ah, vous dirai-je, Maman?” upon the Signora’s
shabby old grand piano. She smeared her pinafores with poor Dick’s
water-colours, and insisted upon producing replicas of the young
scene-painter’s sketches, with all the houses lop-sided, and the trunks
of all the trees gouty. If Dick kept rabbits or silkworms, there was no
greater happiness for Miss Vane than to accompany him to Covent Garden
Market in quest of cabbage or mulberry leaves. I do not mean that she
ever deserted her father for the society of her friend; but there were
times when Mr. Vane absented himself from his little girl; long days,
in which the old man strolled about the streets of the West-End, on the
look-out for the men he had known in his prosperity, with the hope of
borrowing a pound or two, or a handful of loose silver, for the love
of Auld Lang Syne; and longer nights, in which he disappeared from the
Chelsea lodging for many dreary hours.

Then it was that Eleanor Vane was thrown into the companionship of
the Signora and her nephew. Then it was that she read Richard’s books
and periodicals, that she revelled in “Jack Sheppard,” and gloated
over “Wagner, the Wehr Wolf.” Then it was that she played upon the
young man’s violin, and copied his pictures, and destroyed his
water-colours, and gorged his rabbits and silkworms, and loved, and
tormented, and admired him, after the manner of some beautiful younger
sister, who had dropped from the clouds to be his companion.

This is how these two stood towards each other. They had not met for
three years until to-night; and in the interim Miss Eleanor Vane had
grown from a hoyden of twelve into a tall, slender damsel of fifteen.

“You are so altered, Miss Vane,” Richard said, as they walked along the
boulevard, “that I can’t help wondering how it was I knew you.”

“And you’re not altered a bit, Dick,” answered the young lady; “but
don’t call me Miss Vane—it sounds as if you were laughing at me. Call
me Nell, as you used to do, at Chelsea. Do you know, Dick, I contrived
to go to Chelsea once last summer. It was against papa’s wish, you
know, that I should let them find out where I came from at Brixton;
because, you see, Chelsea, or at least the King’s Road, sounds vulgar,
papa thought. Indeed, I believe he said he lived in Cadogan Place,
when the Miss Bennetts asked him the question. He explained it to me
afterwards, you know, poor dear; and it wasn’t exactly a story, for he
had lodged there for a fortnight once, just after his marriage with
mamma, and when he was beginning to get poor. So I was obliged to
manage so cleverly to get to Regent’s Gardens, Dick; and when I did get
there you were gone, and the Signora’s rooms were to let, and there was
a nasty cross old woman in our lodgings, and the scarlet-runners in the
garden were so neglected, and I saw your rabbit-hutches, all broken and
forgotten in the corner by the dust-hole, but the rabbits were gone.
The dear old place seemed so changed, Dick, though Mr. and Mrs. Migson
were very kind, and very pleased to see me, but they couldn’t tell me
where you and the Signora were living.”

“No, we moved two or three times after leaving Regent’s Gardens.
You see we’re obliged to study the pupils, Nell, rather than our
own convenience. Chelsea was a long way from the Waterloo Phœnix,
in spite of the short cuts; but wherever the Signora’s pupils are
thickest, we’re obliged to pitch our tents. They’re thickest about
Tottenham-court Road and Euston Square way now; so we’re living in the
Pilasters, Dudley Street.”

“The Pilasters! That sounds quite grand, Dick.”

“Yes, doesn’t it? _Magnifique et pas cher._ We’ve a chimney-sweep next
door but one, and no end of mangles. The Pilasters would be very nice,
if we’d two sides of the way, but unfortunately we haven’t; the other
side’s stables. It isn’t my prejudices make me object to that; but the
grooms make such an abominable noise cleaning down their horses, and I
wake every morning out of a dream in which it’s Boxing-night, and my
transformation scene is getting the goose.”

The young man laughed cheerily, and guided his companion across the
road to the other side of the boulevard. It was past ten o’clock when
they reached the corner of the Rue de l’Archevêque, and the butcher’s
shop was closed.

Eleanor knew that she had only to push open the little side door, and
that she would find the key of her father’s rooms in the custody of
the butcher’s wife. She was very tired, almost ready to drop, poor
girl, for she had walked a long way since alighting at the Palais Royal
with her father; but she was almost sorry that she had reached her
destination. The sense of her loneliness returned, now that she was to
part with her old friend.

“Thank you very much for seeing me home, Dick,” she said, shaking hands
with the young scene-painter. “It was very selfish of me to bring you
so far out of your way.”

“Selfish of you! Why, you don’t suppose I’d let you prowl about the
streets by yourself, Nell?”

Eleanor’s face flushed as her friend said this: there was a reproach to
her father implied in the speech.

“It was my own fault that I was so late,” she said. “It was only just
nine when papa left me; but I loitered a little, looking at the shops.
I shall see you again, Dick, I hope. But of course I shall, for you’ll
come and see papa, won’t you? How long do you stay in Paris?”

“About a week, I suppose. I’ve a week’s leave of absence, and double
salary, besides my expenses. They know the value of a clever man at the
Phœnix, Miss Vane.”

“And where are you staying, Dick?”

“At the Hôtel des Deux Mondes, near the markets. I’ve an apartment
in convenient proximity to the sky, if I want to study atmospheric
effects. And so you live here, Nell?”

“Yes, those are our windows.”

Eleanor pointed to the open sashes of the entresol: the fluffy worsted
curtains were drawn, but the windows were wide open.

“And you expect your papa home—”

“At eleven o’clock at the latest,” she said.

Richard Thornton sighed. He remembered Mr. Vane’s habits, and he
remembered that the little girl in pinafores had been wont to keep
abnormal hours in her long watches for her father’s coming. He had
often found her, on his return from the transpontine theatre at one or
two o’clock, with the door of the little sitting-room ajar, waiting
patiently for the old man’s coming.

“You won’t sit up for your papa, Nell,” he said, as he shook hands with
her.

“Oh, no, papa told me not to sit up.”

“Good night, then. You look tired, Nell. I’ll call to-morrow, and I’ll
take you to the theatre, if your papa will let you go, and you shall
see ‘Raoul l’Empoisonneur.’ Such a scene, Nell, in the seventh act. The
stage divided into eight compartments, with eight different actions
going on simultaneously, and five murders before the fall of the
curtain. It’s a great piece, and ought to make Spavin and Cromshaw’s
fortune.”

“And yours, Dick.”

“Oh, yes. Cromshaw will shake me by the hand in that delightful,
gentlemanly manner of his: and Spavin—why Spavin will give me a
five-pound note for my adaptation of ‘Raoul,’ and tell every member of
the company, in confidence, that all the great scenes have been written
in by him, and that the piece was utter rubbish till he reconstructed
it.”

“Poor Richard!”

“Yes, Nell, poorer than the gentleman who wrote the almanack, I dare
say. But never mind, Nell. I don’t think the game of life pays for
much expenditure in the way of illumination. I think the wisest people
are those who take existence easily. Spavin’s wealth can’t give him
anything better than diamond studs and a phaeton. The virtuous peasant,
Nell, who can slap his chest, and defy his enemies to pick a hole in
his green-baize jerkin, gets the best of it in the long run, I dare
say.”

“But I wish you were rich, Dick, for the Signora’s sake,” Eleanor said,
gently.

“So do I, Nelly. I wish I was the lessee of the Phœnix, and I’d bring
you out as Juliet, with new palace arches for the ballroom, and a
lime-light in the balcony scene. But, good night, my dear; I mustn’t
keep you standing here like this, though parting is such sweet sorrow,
that I really shouldn’t have the heart to go away to-night if I didn’t
mean to call to-morrow. That line’s rather longer than the original,
Nell, isn’t it?”

Eleanor Vane laughed heartily at her old friend’s random talk, as
she wished him good night. All the light-heartedness of her careless
childhood seemed to return to her in Richard Thornton’s society.
Her childhood had not been an unhappy one, remember; for in all her
father’s troubles he had contrived to keep his head above water,
somehow or other, and the influence of his over-sanguine spirit had
kept Eleanor bright and hopeful under every temporary cloud in the
domestic sky.

But she felt very desolate and lonely as she pushed open the door and
entered the dark passage at the side of the shop. The butcher’s wife
came out at the sound of her footstep, and gave her the key, with some
kindly word of greeting, which Eleanor scarcely understood.

She could only say, “Bon soir, madame,” in her school-girl French, as
she dragged herself slowly up the little winding stair, thoroughly worn
out, physically and mentally, by this time.

The little entresol seemed very close and stifling. She drew back the
curtains, and looked out through the open window; but even the street
itself seemed oppressively hot in the moonless, airless August night.

Eleanor found half a wax-candle in a flat china candlestick, and a box
of matches set ready for her. She lighted this candle, and then flung
off her bonnet and mantle, before she sat down near the window.

“I shall have a very short time to wait, if papa comes home at eleven
o’clock,” she thought.

Alas! she remembered in her old childish experiences, that he had
_never_ come home at the promised hour. How often, ah, how often, she
had waited, counting the weary hours upon the church clocks,—there was
one which chimed the quarters; and trembling sometimes at those strange
sounds which break the night silence of every house. How often she had
“hoped against hope,” that he might, for this once, return at the time
he had promised.

She took the candle in her hand and looked about for a book. She wanted
to while away the dreary interval which she knew must elapse before
her father’s return. She found a novel of Paul Féval’s in a dirty and
tattered cover, on the little marble-topped writing-table. The leaves
were crumpled, and smeared with stains and splotches of grease, for it
was Mr. Vane’s habit to amuse himself with a work of fiction while he
took his matutinal roll and coffee. He had taken to novel reading in
his frivolous old age, and was as fond of a sentimental story as any
school-girl,—as his daughter herself.

Miss Vane drew the lumbering little table to the open window, and sat
down before it, with her candle close to her elbow, and the tattered
book spread out before her. No breath of air flickered the flame of her
candle, or ruffled the golden hair swept back from her brow.

The passers-by upon the opposite side of the street—they were few and
far between by this time—looked up at the lighted window, and saw a
pretty picture by the dim glimmer of that solitary candle. The picture
of a girl, serene in her youth and innocence, bending over her book:
her pale muslin dress and auburn hair faintly visible in the subdued
light.

The rattle of wheels and the cries of coachmen sounded far off upon
the boulevard, and in the Rue de Rivoli, and only made the silence
more palpable in the Rue de l’Archevêque. Now and then a carriage came
into that quiet corner, and Eleanor Vane looked up from her book,
breathless, eager, expectant, fondly hoping that her father might have
come back to her in some hired vehicle: but the solitary carriage
always rolled away, until the sound of its wheels mixed with the rattle
of the distant wheels upon the boulevards.

There were clocks in the distance that struck the quarters. How long
those quarters seemed! Paul Féval was very interesting, no doubt.
There was an awful mystery in those greasy tattered pages: a ghastly
mystery about two drowned young women, treacherously made away with, as
it seemed, upon the shore of a dreary river overshadowed by willows.
There were villains and rascals paramount throughout this delightful
romance; and there was mystery and murder enough for half a dozen
novels. But Eleanor’s thoughts wandered away from the page. The dreary
river bank and the ghostly pollard-willows, the drowned young women,
and the ubiquitous villains, all mingled themselves with her anxious
thoughts about her father; and the trouble in the book seemed to become
a part of the trouble in her own mind, adding its dismal weight to her
anxieties.

There were splotchy engravings scattered here and there through the
pages of Monsieur Féval’s romance, and Eleanor fancied by-and-by that
the villain in these pictures was like the sulky stranger who had
followed her father and the Frenchman away towards the Barrière Saint
Antoine.

She fancied this, although she had scarcely seen that silent stranger’s
face. He had kept it, as it seemed, purposely averted, and she had only
caught one glimpse of the restless black eyes under the shadow of his
hat, and the thick moustache that shrouded his mouth. There is always
something mysterious and unpleasant in the idea of anything that has
been hidden from us, however trivial and insignificant that thing may
be. Eleanor Vane, growing more and more nervous as the slow hours crept
away, began to worry herself with the vivid recollection of that one
brief glimpse in which she had seen the silent stranger’s face.

“He cannot have a good countenance,” she thought, “or the recollection
of it would not make me so uncomfortable. How rude he was, too! I did
not much like the Frenchman, but at least he was polite. The other
man was very disagreeable. I hope he is not a friend of papa’s.” And
then she returned to the drowned young women, and the water-side, and
the willows; trying in vain to bury herself in the romance, and not
to listen so eagerly for the striking of the quarters. Sometimes she
thought, “Before I turn over to the next page, papa will be home,”
or, “Before I can finish this chapter I shall hear his step upon the
stairs.”

Breathless though the night was, there were many sounds that disturbed
and mocked this anxious watcher. Sometimes the door below shook—as if
by some mysterious agency, there being no wind—and Eleanor fancied that
her father’s hand was on the latch. Sometimes the stairs creaked, and
she started from her chair, eager to run and receive him, and firmly
believing that he was stealing stealthily up to his apartments, anxious
not to disturb the sleeping inmates of the house. She had known his
cautious footfall sound exactly thus in her old midnight watches.

But all these sounds were only miserable delusions. Quarter after
quarter, each quarter longer than the last, hour after hour struck
from the clocks distant and near. The rattling of the wheels upon the
boulevards had died gradually away, and at last had ceased altogether.

It was long past four, and Eleanor had pushed aside her book. It was
daylight,—grey, cold, morning, chill and dismal after the oppressive
August night, and she stood now in the window watching the empty street.

But still the quarters chimed from the distant clocks: those distant
chimes had become terribly distinct now in the early morning stillness.
But the silence was not of long duration. The rumble of waggon wheels
sounded far away in the Rue St. Honoré. The rush and clatter of a
detachment or cavalry clashed upon the asphalte of the Place de la
Concorde. The early sound of a horn called out some wretched recruits
to perform their morning exercise in the courtyards of the Louvre. The
cheerful voices of workpeople echoed in the streets; dogs were barking,
birds singing, the yellow sun mounting in a cloudless heaven.

But there were no signs of the coming of George Vane with the morning
sunlight; and as the day grew older and brighter, the anxious face of
the pale watcher at the open window only grew paler and more anxious.




CHAPTER VI.

THE BLACK BUILDING BY THE RIVER.


Richard Thornton was by no means an early riser. He was generally one
of the last of those gentlemen who shuffled into the orchestra at the
ten o’clock rehearsal of a new melodrama, in which all the effect of
a murder or an abduction depended upon the pizzicato twittering of
violins, and the introduction of explosive chords at particular crises
in the action of the piece. Mr. Thornton was a sluggard, who complained
most bitterly of the heartlessness of stage managers and prompter’s
minions, who seemed to take a malicious delight in nailing cruel slips
of paper to the door-post of the Phœnix; terrible mandates, wherein the
Full Band was called at ten; “no ten minutes;” the meaning of this last
mysterious clause being that the ten minutes’ grace which is usually
accorded to the tardy performer shall on this occasion be cut off and
done away with.

But Richard was out for a holiday now. The eyes of Messrs. Spavin and
Cromshaw would fain have followed him in his Parisian wanderings, to
see that he did double work for his double wage; but the proprietors
of the Royal Waterloo Phœnix not being blessed with the gift of
clairvoyance, Mr. Thornton defied and snapped his fingers at them,
secure in the consciousness of his own value.

“If J. T. Jumballs, the author of all the original dramas they have
done at the Phœnix for the last ten years, understood French, he’d
do ‘Raoul’ for two pound ten,” thought Richard, as he stood before
his looking-glass in the blazing August sunshine, rubbing his chin
contemplatively, and wondering whether the bristles would be too strong
if he let them stop till another morning.

If the honest truth is to be recorded, it must be acknowledged that
Mr. Thornton was by no means too scrupulous in the performance of
his toilet. He had a habit of forgetting to shave until his chin
was covered by an appearance of red stubble, dappled here and there
by patches of blue and brown, for his beard was wont to crop up in
unexpected hues, which surprised even himself. He sympathized with the
great lexicographer in not having any overstrained partiality for clean
linen, and, indeed, usually wore a coloured shirt, the bosom of which
was arabesqued with stray splashes of whitewash and distemper, to say
nothing of occasional meandering evidences of the numerous pints of
porter imbibed by the young artist during his day’s labour. When Mr.
Thornton bought a new suit of clothes he put them on, and wore them
continuously; and ate and drank and painted in them until they were so
worn and frayed, and enfeebled by ill treatment, that they began to
drop away from him in rusty fragments like the withered leaves which
fall from a sturdy young oak. There were people who declared that Mr.
Thornton slept in his ordinary costume; but of course this was a cruel
slander.

To walk eight or nine miles a day to and fro between the place of your
abode and the scene of your occupation; to paint the best part of the
scenery for a large theatre in which new pieces are brought out pretty
frequently; to play second fiddle, and attend early rehearsals upon
cold mornings; to jot down the music cues in a melodrama, or accompany
Mr. Grigsby in his new comic song, or Madame Rosalbini in her latest
cachuca; and to adapt a French drama, now and then, by way of adding a
few extra pounds to your income, is not exactly to lead an idle life;
so perhaps poor Richard Thornton may be forgiven if his friends had
occasion to laugh at his indifference upon the subject of soap and
water. They even went so far as to call him “Dirty Dick,” in their
more facetious moments; but I don’t think the obnoxious _sobriquet_
wounded Richard’s feelings. Everybody liked him and respected him as a
generous-hearted, genial-tempered, honourable-minded fellow, who would
scarcely have told a lie to save his life, and who scorned to drink a
pint of beer that he couldn’t pay for, or to accept a favour which he
didn’t mean to return.

People at the Phœnix knew that Richard Thornton’s father had been a
gentleman, and that the young man had a certain pride of his own. He
was the only man in the theatre who neither abused nor flattered his
employers. The carpenters and gasmen touched their caps when they
talked to him, though he was shabbier than any of those _employés_;
the little ballet girls were fond of him, and came to tell him
their troubles when the cruel stage-manager had put their names
down for shilling fines in a horrible book which was to be seen on
the treasury table every Saturday morning. The old cleaners of the
theatre told Mr. Thornton about their rheumatic knee-joints, and came
to him for sympathy after dreary hours of scouring. He had patience
with and compassion for every one. People knew that he was kind and
tender-hearted; for his pencil initials always appeared in some obscure
corner of every subscription list, against a sum which was bulky when
taken in relation to the amount of his salary. People knew that he was
brave, for he had once threatened to fling Mr. Spavin into the pit when
that gentleman had made some insinuation impeaching Richard’s honour
as to the unfair use of gold-leaf in the Enchanted Caves of Azure
Deep. They knew that he was dutiful, and kind, and true to the old
music-mistress with whom he lived, and whom he helped to support. They
knew that when other men made light of sacred things, and were witty
and philosophical upon very solemn subjects, Richard Thornton would
leave the assembly gravely and quietly, how eloquent or lively soever
he might have been before. People knew all this, and were respectful to
the young scene-painter, in spite of the rainbow smears of paint upon
his shabby coat, and the occasional fringe of mud upon the frayed edges
of his trousers.

Upon this August morning Mr. Thornton made very short work of his
toilet.

“I won’t go out to breakfast,” he thought, “though I can get two
courses and a dessert in the Palais Royal, to say nothing of half a
bottle of sour claret, for fifteen pence. I’ll get some coffee and
rolls, and go to work at some of the scenes for ‘Raoul.’”

He rang a bell near his bed, pushed a table to the window, which looked
out into the quadrangle of the hotel, and sat down with a battered tin
box of water-colours and a few squares of Bristol board before him. He
had to ring several times before one of the waiters condescended to
answer his summons, but he worked away cheerily, smoking as he worked,
at a careful water-coloured copy of a rough pencil sketch which he had
made a couple of nights before in the pit of the theatre.

He didn’t leave off to eat his breakfast when it came, by-and-by; but
ate his rolls and drank his coffee in the pauses of his work, only
laying down his brush for a minute or so at a time. The scene was a
street in old Paris, the houses very dark and brown, with over-hanging
latticed windows, exterior staircases, practicable bridges, and all
sorts of devices which called for the employment of a great deal of
glue and pasteboard in Richard’s model. This scene was only one out of
eight, and the young scene-painter wanted to take perfect models of
all the eight scenes back to the Phœnix. He had M. Michel Lévy’s sixty
centimes edition of the new play spread open before him, and referred
to it now and again as he painted.

“Humph! Enter _Raoul_ down staircase in flat. _Raoul’s_ a doctor, and
the house with the staircase is his. The house at the corner belongs
to _Gobemouche_, the comic barber, and the practicable lattice is
_Madeline’s_. She’ll come to her window by-and-by to talk to the
doctor, whom she thinks a very excellent man; though he’s been giving
her mild doses of _aqua tofana_ for the last three weeks. _Catherine
de Medicis_ comes over the practicable bridge, presently, disguised
as a nun. I wonder how many melodramas poor _Catherine_ has appeared
in since she left this mortal stage? Did she ever do anything except
poison people, I wonder, while she was alive? She never does anything
else at the Porte Saint Martin, or on the Surrey side of the Thames.
I must sketch the costumes, by-and-by. _Raoul_ in black velvet
and scarlet hose, a pointed beard, straight eyebrows, short black
hair,—austere and dignified. Cromshaw will do _Raoul_, of course; and
Spavin will play the light-comedy soldier who gets drunk, and tears
off _Catherine’s_ velvet mask in the last scene. Yes, that’ll be a
great scene on our side of the water. _Charles the Ninth_—he’s a muff,
so anybody can play him—has just finished reading the arsenicated
edition of a treatise on hawking, closes the last page of the book,
feels the first spasm. _Catherine_, disguised as a nun, has been
followed by Spavin—by the comedy-soldier, I mean—to the Louvre, after a
conversation having been overheard between her and _Raoul_. The _King_,
in the agonies of spasmodic affection, asks who has murdered him. ‘That
woman—that sorceress—that fiend in human form!’ cries the soldier,
snatching the mask from _Catherine’s_ face.—‘Merciful Heaven, it is my
mother!’ shrieks the _King_, falling dead with a final spasm. That ‘It
is my mother!’ ought to be good for three rounds of applause at least.
I dare say Spavin will have the speech transferred from the _King’s_
part to his own. ‘Merciful Heaven, it is _his_ mother!’ would do just
as well.”

Poor Richard Thornton, not having risen very early, worked on till past
five o’clock in the afternoon before his model was finished. He got
up with a sigh of relief when the pasteboard presentment of the old
Parisian street stood out upon the little table, square and perfect.

He filled his pipe and walked up and down before the table, smoking and
admiring his work in an innocent rapture.

“Poor Nelly,” he thought presently. “I promised I would call in the
Rue de l’Archevêque to-day, to pay my respects to the old chap. Not
that he’d particularly care to see me, I dare say, but Nell is such a
darling. If she asked me to stand on my head, and do poor old Goffie’s
gnome-fly business, I think I should try and do it. However, it is
too late to call upon Mr. Vandeleur Vane to-day, so I must put that
off till to-morrow. I must drop in again at half-price at the Porte
Saint Martin, to have another look at the scene in eight compartments.
That’ll be rather a poser for the machinist at the Phœnix, I flatter
myself. Yes, I must have one more look at it, and—Ah! by the bye,
there’s the Morgue!”

Mr. Thornton finished his pipe and rubbed his chin with a reflective
air.

“Yes, I must have a look at the Morgue before I go,” he thought; “I
promised that old nuisance, J. T. Jumballs, that I’d refresh my memory
about the Morgue. He’s doing a great drama in which one-half of the
_dramatis personæ_ recognize the other half dead on the marble slabs.
He’s never been across the Channel, and I think his notions of the
Morgue are somewhat foggy. He fancies it’s about as big as Westminster
Abbey, I know, and he wants the governors to give him the whole depth
of the stage for his great scene, and set it obliquely, like the
Assyrian hall in ‘Sardanapalus,’ so as to give the idea of illimitable
extent. I’m to paint the scene for him. ‘_The interior of the Morgue by
lamplight. The meeting of the living and the dead._’ That’ll be rather
a strong line for the bill, at any rate. I’ll go and have some dinner
in the Palais Royal, and then go down and have a look at the gloomy
place. An exterior wouldn’t be bad, with Notre Dame in the distance,
but an _interior_—Bah! J. T. J. is a clever fellow, but I wish his
genius didn’t lie so much in the charnel-house.”

He put on his hat, left his room, locked the door, and ran down the
polished staircase, whistling merrily as he went. He was glad to
be released from his work, pleased at the prospect of a few hours’
idleness in the foreign city. Many people, inhabitants and visitors,
thought Paris dull, dreary, and deserted in this hot August weather,
but it was a delightful change from the Pilasters and the primeval
solitudes of Northumberland Square, that quaint, grim quadrangle of big
houses, whose prim middle-class inhabitants looked coldly over their
smart wire window-blinds at poor Richard’s shabby coat.

Mr. Thornton got an excellent dinner at a great bustling restaurateur’s
in the Palais Royal, where for two francs one might dine upon all
the delicacies of the season, in a splendid saloon, enlivened by the
martial braying of a brass band in the garden below.

The _carte de jour_ almost bewildered Richard by its extent and
grandeur, and he chose haphazard from the catalogue of soups which
the obliging waiter gabbled over for his instruction. He read all
the pleasing by-laws touching the non-division of dinners, and the
admissibility of exchanges in the way of a dish for a dessert, or
a dessert for a dish, by payment of a few extra centimes. He saw
that almost all the diners hid themselves behind great wedges of
orange-coloured melon at an early stage of the banquet, and generally
wound up with a small white washing-basin of lobster salad, the
preparation of which was a matter of slow and solemn care and thought.
He ordered his dinner in humble imitation of these accomplished
_habitués_, and got very good value for his two francs. Then he paid
his money; bowed to the graceful lady who sat in splendid attire in
a very bower of salads and desserts, and went down a broad staircase
that led into a street behind the Palais Royal, and thence to the Rue
Richelieu.

He treated himself to a cup of coffee and a cigar at a café in the
Place de la Bourse, and then strolled slowly away towards the Seine,
smoking, and dawdling to look at this and that as he walked along. It
was nearly eight o’clock, therefore, when he emerged, from some narrow
street, upon the quay, and made his way towards that bridge beneath
whose shadow the Morgue hides, like some foul and unhallowed thing. He
did not much like the task which Mr. Jumballs had imposed upon him,
but he was too good-natured to refuse compliance with the transpontine
dramatist’s desire, and far too conscientious to break a promise once
made, however disagreeable the performance of that promise might prove.

He walked on resolutely, therefore, towards the black shed-like
building.

“I hope there are no bodies there to-night,” he thought. “One glance
round the place will show me all I want to see. I hope there are no
poor dead creatures there to-night.”

He stopped before going in, and looked at a couple of women who were
standing near, chattering together with no little gesticulation.

He asked one of these women the question, Were there any bodies in the
Morgue?

Yes,—the women both answered with one voice. There had not long been
brought the body of a gentleman, an officer it was thought, poisoned in
a gaming-house. A murder, perhaps, or a suicide; no one knew which.

Richard Thornton shrugged his shoulders as he turned away from the idle
gossips.

“Some people would call me a coward if they knew how I dislike going
into this place,” he thought.

He threw away his cigar, took off his hat, and slowly crossed the dark
threshold of the Parisian dead-house.

When he came out again, which was not until after the lapse of at least
a quarter of an hour, his face was almost as white as the face of the
corpse he had left within. He went upon the bridge, scarcely knowing
where he went, and walking like a man who walks in his sleep.

Not more than half a dozen yards from the Morgue he came suddenly upon
the lonely figure of a girl, whose arm rested on the parapet of the
bridge, and whose pale face was turned towards the towers of Notre Dame.

She looked up as he approached, and called him by his name.

“_You_ here, Eleanor?” he cried. “Come away, child; come away, for
pity’s sake!”




CHAPTER VII.

SUSPENSE.


Eleanor Vane and the scene-painter stood upon the bridge looking at
each other for a few moments after Richard’s cry of mingled terror and
astonishment.

Had not Eleanor’s mind been entirely absorbed by one cruel anxiety, she
would have wondered at her old friend’s strange greeting. As it was
she took no heed of his manner. The shadows of the summer night were
gathering over the city and upon the quiet river; the towers of Notre
Dame loomed dimly through the twilight.

“Oh, Richard!” Eleanor cried, “I have been so unhappy. Papa didn’t come
home all last night, nor yet to-day. I waited for him hour after hour
until late in the afternoon; and then the house seemed unbearable; I
_couldn’t_ stay in any longer, and I came out to look for him. I have
been far up on the Boulevard where I parted with him last night, and
all the way along the crowded streets about there: and then through
other streets, till I found myself down here by the water, and I’m so
tired! Oh, Dick, Dick, how unkind of papa not to come home! How unkind
of my darling father to give me this misery.”

She clasped her hands convulsively upon her companion’s arm, and
bending her head, burst into tears. Those tears were the first which
she had shed in all her trouble; the first relief after long hours of
agonizing suspense, of weary watching.

“Oh, how can papa treat me so?” she cried, amid her sobbing. “How can
he treat me so?”

Then, suddenly raising her head, she looked at Richard Thornton, her
clear grey eyes dilated with a wild terror, which gave her face a
strange and awful beauty.

“Richard!” she cried, “Richard! you don’t think that there—that there
is—anything wrong—that anything has happened to my father?”

She did not wait for him to answer, but cried out directly, as if
shrinking in terror from the awful suggestion in her own words:

“What should happen to him? He is so well and strong, poor darling. If
he is old, he is not _like_ an old man, you know. The people of the
house in the Rue de l’Archevêque have been very kind to me; they say
I’m quite foolish to be frightened, and they told me that papa stopped
out all night once last summer. He went to Versailles to see some
friends, and stayed away all night without giving any notice that he
was going to do so. I know it is very silly of me to be so frightened,
Richard. But I always was frightened at Chelsea if he stayed out. I
used to fancy all sorts of things. I thought of all kinds of dreadful
things last night, Dick, and to-day; until my fancies almost drove me
mad.”

During all this time the scene-painter had not spoken. He seemed unable
to offer any word of comfort to the poor girl who clung to him in her
distress, looking to him for consolation and hope.

She looked wonderingly into his face, puzzled by his silence, which
seemed unfeeling; and it was not like Richard to be unfeeling.

“Richard!” she cried, almost impatiently. “Richard, speak to me! You
see how much misery I have suffered, and you don’t say a word! You’ll
help me to find papa, won’t you?”

The young man looked down at her. Heaven knows she would have seen no
lack of tenderness or compassion in his face, if it had not been hidden
by the gathering gloom of the August evening. He drew her hand through
his arm, and led her away towards the other side of the water, leaving
the black roof of the dead-house behind him.

“There is nothing I would not do to help you, Eleanor,” he said,
gently. “God knows my heart, my dear; and He knows how faithfully I
will try to help you.”

“And you will look for papa, Richard, if he should not come home
to-night,—he may be at home now, you know, and he may be angry with
me for coming out alone, instead of waiting quietly till he returned;
but if he should not come to-night, you’ll look for him, won’t you,
Richard? You’ll search all Paris till you find him?”

“I’ll do everything that I could do for you if I were your brother,
Eleanor,” the young man answered, gravely; “there are times in our
lives when nobody but God can help us, my dear, and when we must turn
to Him. It’s in the day of trouble that we want His help, Nelly.”

“Yes, yes, I know. I prayed, last night, again, and again, and again,
that papa might come back soon. I have been saying the same prayer
all to-day, Richard; even just now, when you found me standing by the
parapet of the bridge, I was praying for my dear father. I saw the
church towers looking so grand and solemn in the twilight, and the
sight of them made me remember how powerful God is, and that He can
always grant our prayers.”

“If it seems best and wisest in His sight, Nell.”

“Yes, of course; sometimes we pray for foolish things, but there could
be nothing foolish in wishing my darling father to come back to me.
Where are you taking me, Dick?”

Eleanor stopped suddenly, and looked at her companion. She had need to
ask the question, for Richard Thornton was leading her into a labyrinth
of streets in the direction of the Luxembourg, and he seemed to have
very little notion whither he was going.

“This is not the way home, Richard,” Eleanor said; “I don’t know where
we are, but we seem to be going farther and farther away from home.
Will you take me back to the Rue de l’Archevêque, Dick? We must cross
the river again, you know, to get there. I want to go home at once.
Papa may have come home, and he’ll be angry, perhaps, if he finds me
absent. Take me home, Dick.”

“I will, my dear. We’ll cross the water farther on, by the Louvre; and
now tell me, Eleanor—I—I can’t very well make inquiries about your
father, unless I fully understand the circumstances under which you
parted from him last night. How was it, my dear? What happened when Mr.
Vane left you upon the Boulevard?”

They were walking in a broad, quiet street in which there were very
few passers-by. The houses stood back behind ponderous gates, and were
hidden by sheltering walls. The stately mansions between court and
garden had rather a decayed aspect, which gave a certain dreariness
to their grandeur. The fashionable world seemed to have deserted this
quiet quarter for the leafy avenues leading away from the Champs
Elysées.

Richard and Eleanor walked slowly along the broad footway. The
stillness of the soft summer night had some effect upon the
school-girl’s fever of impatience. The grave, compassionate tones
of her friend’s voice soothed her. The burst of passionate weeping
which had almost convulsed her slight frame half an hour before, had
been an unspeakable relief to her. She clung to her companion’s arm
confidingly, and walked patiently by his side; without questioning him
as to where he was leading her, though she had a vague idea that he was
not taking her homewards.

“I will not be foolish about papa,” she said; “I will do as you tell
me, Richard; I will trust in God. I am sure my dear father will return
to me. We are so fond of each other; you know, Richard, we are all the
world to each other; and my poor darling looks so hopefully forward
to the day in which he will have Mr. de Crespigny’s fortune. I don’t
hope for that quite so much as papa does, Dick; for Mr. de Crespigny
may live to be a very, very old man, and it seems so wicked to wish
for any one’s death. The day I look forward to is the day when I shall
have finished my education, and be able to work for papa. That must be
almost better than being rich, I should think, Dick. I can’t imagine
any happier fate than to work for those we love.”

Her face brightened as she talked, and she turned to her companion,
looking to him for sympathy; but Richard’s head was averted, and he
seemed to be staring absently at the houses upon the opposite side of
the way.

He was silent for some moments after Eleanor had left off speaking; and
then he said, rather abruptly:

“Tell me, my dear, how did you part with your father last night?”

“Why, we had been dining on the Boulevard; and after dinner papa took
me for a long walk, ever so far, past all the theatres, and he had
promised to take me to the Ambigu or the Porte Saint Martin; but as we
were coming back we met two gentlemen, friends of papa’s, who stopped
him, and said they had an appointment with him, and persuaded him to go
back with them.”

“Back with them! Back where?”

“I mean back towards a big stone gateway we had passed a little time
before. I only know they turned that way, but I don’t know where they
went. I stood and watched them till they were out of sight.”

“And the two men, what were they like?”

“One of them was a little Frenchman, stout and rosy-faced, with a light
moustache and beard like the Emperor’s. He was smartly dressed, and had
a cane, which he kept twirling when he talked to papa.”

“Did you hear what he said?”

“No, he spoke in a low voice, and he talked French.”

“But you speak French, Eleanor?”

“Yes, but not as they speak it here. The people seem to talk so fast
here, it’s quite difficult to understand them.”

“But the other man, Nell; what was he like?”

“Oh, he was a disagreeable-looking man, and seemed to have a sulky
manner, as if he was offended with papa for breaking his appointment,
and didn’t care how the matter ended. I scarcely saw his face—at least
only for a moment—just long enough to see that he had black eyes, and a
thick black moustache. He was tall, and shabbily dressed, and I fancied
he was an Englishman, though he never once spoke.”

“He never spoke! It was the Frenchman, then, who persuaded your father
to go away with him?”

“Yes.”

“And he seemed very anxious?”

“Oh, yes, very anxious.”

Richard Thornton muttered something between his set teeth, something
which sounded like a curse.

“Tell me one thing, Eleanor,” he said. “Your poor father never was too
well off, I know. He could not be likely to have much money about him
last night. Do you know if he had any?”

“Yes, he had a great deal of money.”

“What do you mean by a great deal? A few pounds, I suppose?”

“Oh, much more than that,” Eleanor answered. “He had a hundred pounds—a
hundred pounds in new bank notes—French notes. It was the money my
half-sister, Mrs. Bannister, had sent him, to pay for my education at
Madame Marly’s.”

“Mrs. Bannister,” said Richard, catching at the name. “Ah, to be sure,
I remember now. Mrs. Bannister is your sister. She is very well off,
is she not, and has been kind to you? If you were in any trouble, you
would go to her, I suppose, Eleanor?”

“Go to her if I were in trouble! Oh, no, no, Dick, not for the world!”

“But why not? She has been kind to you, hasn’t she, Nell?”

“Oh, yes, very kind in paying money for my education, and all that; but
you know, Richard, there are some people who seem to do kind things
in an unkind manner. If you knew the cruel letter that Mrs. Bannister
wrote to papa—the cruel, humiliating things she said only a few days
ago, you couldn’t wonder that I don’t like her.”

“But she is your sister, Nell; your nearest relation.”

“Except papa.”

“And she ought to love you, and be kind to you. She lives at Bayswater,
I think I’ve heard you say?”

“Yes, in Hyde Park Gardens.”

“To be sure. Mrs. Bannister, Hyde Park Gardens, Bayswater.”

He repeated the name and address, as if he wished to impress them upon
his memory.

“I will take you home now, Nell,” he said. “My poor child, you must be
tired to death.”

“How can I think about being tired, Richard,” exclaimed Eleanor, “when
I am so anxious about papa? Oh, if I only find him at home, what
happiness it will be!”

But she hung heavily upon her friend’s arm, and Richard knew that she
was very tired. She had been wandering about Paris for several hours,
poor child, hither and thither, in the long, unfamiliar streets,
following all sorts of unlikely people who looked in the distance
something like her father; hoping again and again, only again and again
to be disappointed.

They turned into a wider thoroughfare presently, and the scene-painter
called the first hackney vehicle which passed him, and lifted Eleanor
into it. She was almost fainting with fatigue and exhaustion.

“What have you had to eat to-day, Nell?” he asked.

She hesitated a little, as if she had forgotten what she had eaten, or
indeed whether she had eaten at all.

“There was some coffee and a couple of rolls sent for papa this
morning. He has his breakfast sent him from a _traiteur’s_, you know. I
had one of the rolls.”

“And you’ve had nothing since?”

“No. How could I eat when I was so wretched about papa?”

Richard shook his head reproachfully.

“My darling Nell!” he said, “you promised me just now that you’d be a
good girl, and trust in Providence. I shall take you somewhere and give
you some supper, and then you must promise me to go home and get a good
night’s rest.”

“I will do whatever you tell me, Richard,” Eleanor answered,
submissively, “but let me go home first, please, and see if papa has
come back.”

The scene-painter did not for a few moments reply to this request, but
he answered presently in an abstracted tone:

“You shall do what you like, Nell.”

He told the coachman to drive to the Rue de l’Archevêque, but he would
not let Eleanor alight from the vehicle when they reached the corner of
the street and the little butcher’s shop, eager as she was to spring
out and run into the house.

“Stay where you are, Nell,” he said authoritatively. “I will make all
inquiries.”

Eleanor obeyed him. She was exhausted by a weary night of watching,
a long day of agitation and anxiety, and she was too weak to oppose
her old friend. She looked hopelessly up at the open windows on the
entresol. They were exactly as she had left them four or five hours
ago. No glimmer of light gave friendly token that the rooms were
occupied.

Richard Thornton talked to the butcher’s wife for a long time, as it
seemed to Eleanor; but he had very little to tell her when he came back
to the carriage. Mr. Vane had not returned: that was all he said.

He took his companion to a café near the Madeleine, where he insisted
upon her taking a large cup of coffee and a roll. It was all he could
persuade her to take, and she begged to be allowed to sit at one of the
tables outside the café.

“She might see her father go by,” she said, “on his way to the Rue de
l’Archevêque.”

The two friends sat at a little iron table rather apart from the
groups of animated loungers sitting at other tables drinking coffee
and lemonade. But George Mowbray Vandeleur Vane did not pass that way
throughout the half hour during which Eleanor lingered over her cup of
coffee.

It was past ten o’clock when Richard Thornton bade her good night at
the threshold of the little door beside the butcher’s shop.

“You must promise me not to sit up to-night, Nelly,” he said, as he
shook hands with her.

“Yes, Richard.”

“And mind you keep your promise this time. I will come and see you
early to-morrow. God bless you, my dear, and good night!”

He pressed her hand tenderly. When she had closed the door behind her,
he crossed the narrow street, and waited upon the other side of the way
until he saw a light in one of the entresol windows. He watched while
Eleanor came to this window and drew a dark curtain across it, and then
he walked slowly away.

“God bless her, poor child,” he murmured, in a low, compassionate
voice, “poor lonely child!”

The grave thoughtfulness of his expression never changed as he walked
homewards to the Hôtel des Deux Mondes. Late as it was when he reached
his chamber on the fifth story, he seated himself at the table, and
pushing aside his clay pipe and tobacco-pouch, his water-colours and
brushes, his broken palettes and scraps of Bristol board, and all the
litter of his day’s work, he took a few sheets of foreign letter paper
and a bottle of ink from a shabby leather desk, and began to write.

He wrote two letters, both rather long, and folded, sealed, and
directed them.

One was addressed to Mrs. Bannister, Hyde Park Gardens, Bayswater;
the other to Signora Picirillo, the Pilasters, Dudley Street,
Northumberland Square.

Richard Thornton put both these letters in his pocket and went out to
post them.

“I think I have acted for the best,” he muttered, as he went back
to the hotel near the market-place; “I can do nothing more until
to-morrow.”




CHAPTER VIII.

GOOD SAMARITANS.


George Vane did not come home. Eleanor kept the promise made to her
faithful friend, and tried to sleep. She flung herself, dressed as
she was, upon the little bed near the curtained alcove. She would
thus be ready to run to her father, whenever he came in, she thought,
to welcome and minister to him. She was thoroughly worn out, and she
slept; a wretched slumber, broken by nightmares and horrible dreams, in
which she saw her father assailed by all kinds of dangers, a prey to
every manner of misfortune and vicissitude. Once she saw him standing
on a horrible rock, menaced by a swiftly advancing tide, while she was
in a boat only a few paces from him, as it seemed, doing battle with
the black waves, and striving with all her might to reach and rescue
him, but never able to do so.

In another dream he was wandering upon the crumbling verge of a
precipice—he seemed a white-haired, feeble, tottering old man in this
vision—and again she was near him, but unable to give him warning
of his danger, though a word would have done so. The agony of her
endeavour to utter the one cry which would have called that idolized
father from his death, awoke her.

But she had other dreams, dreams of quite a different character, in
which her father was restored to her, rich and prosperous, and he and
she were laughing merrily at all the foolish tortures she had inflicted
upon herself; and other dreams again which seemed so real that she
fancied she must be awake: dreams in which she heard the welcome
footsteps upon the stair, the opening of the door, and her father’s
voice in the next room calling to her.

These dreams were the worst of all. It was terrible to awake after many
such delusions and find she had been again deluded. It was cruel to
awake to the full sense of her loneliness, while the sound of the voice
she had heard in her dream still lingered in her ears.

The dark hours of the short summer night seemed interminable to her
in this wretched, bewildered, half-sleeping, half-waking state; even
longer than they had appeared when she sat up watching for her father’s
return. Every fresh dream was a slow agony of terror and perplexity.

At last the grey daylight stole in through the half-closed shutters,
the vague outlines of the furniture grew out of the darkness; duskily
impalpable and ghastly at first, then sharp and distinct in the cold
morning light. She could not rest any longer; she got up and went to
the window; she pushed the sash open, and sank down on her knees with
her forehead resting on the window sill.

“I will wait for him here,” she thought; “I shall hear his step in the
street. Poor dear, poor dear, I can guess why he stays away. He has
spent that odious money, and does not like to return and tell me so.
My darling father, do you know me so little as to think that I would
grudge you the last farthing I had in the world, if you wanted it?”

Her thoughts rambled on in strange confusion until they grew
bewildering; her brain became dizzy with perpetual repetitions of the
same idea; when she lifted her head—her poor, weary, burning, heavy
head, which seemed a leaden weight that it was almost impossible to
raise—and looked from the window, the street below reeled beneath her
eyes, the floor upon which she knelt seemed sinking with her into some
deep guff of blackness and horror. A thousand conflicting sounds—not
the morning noises of the waking city—hissed and buzzed, and roared and
thundered in her ears, growing louder and louder and louder, until they
all melted away in the fast-gathering darkness.

       *       *       *       *       *

The sun was shining brightly into the room when the compassionate
mistress of the house found Mr. Vane’s daughter half kneeling, half
lying on the ground, with her head upon the cold sill of the open
window, and her auburn hair streaming in draggled curls about her
shoulders. Her thin muslin frock was wet with the early dew. She had
fainted away, and had lain thus, helpless and insensible, for several
hours.

The butcher’s wife undressed her and put her to bed. Richard Thornton
came to the Rue de l’Archevêque half an hour afterwards, and went away
again directly to look for an English doctor. He found one, an elderly
man with grave and gentle manners, who declared that Miss Vane was
suffering from fever brought on by intense mental excitement; she was
of a highly nervous temperament, he said, and that she required little
to be done for her; she only wanted repose and quiet. Her constitution
was superb, and would triumph over a far more serious attack than this.

Richard Thornton took the doctor into the adjoining room, the little
sitting-room which bore the traces of Mr. Vane’s occupation, and talked
to him in a low voice for some minutes. The medical man shook his head
gravely.

“It is very sad,” he said; “it will be better to tell her the truth, if
possible, as soon as she recovers from the delirium. The anxiety and
suspense have overtaken her brain. Anything would be better than that
this overstrained state of the mind should continue. Her constitution
will rally after a shock; but with her highly nervous and imaginative
nature, everything is to be dreaded from prolonged mental irritation.
She is related to you, I suppose?”

“No, poor child, I wish she were.”

“But she is not without near relatives, I hope?”

“No, she has sisters—or at least half sisters—and brothers.”

“They should be written to, then, immediately,” the doctor said, as he
took up his hat.

“I have written to one of her sisters, and I have written to another
lady, a friend, who will be of more use, I fancy, in this crisis.”

The doctor went away, promising to send some saline draughts to keep
the fever under, and to call again in the evening.

Richard Thornton went into the little bed-chamber, where the butcher’s
wife sat beside the curtained alcove, making up some accounts in a
leather-covered book. She was a hearty, pleasant-mannered young woman,
and had taken up her post by the invalid’s bed very willingly, although
her presence was always much needed in the shop below.

“_Chut_,” she whispered, with her finger on her lip, “she sleeps,
_pauvrette_!”

Richard sat down quietly by the open window. He took out Michel Levy’s
edition of “Raoul,” a stump of lead pencil, and the back of an old
letter, and set to work resolutely at his adaptation. He could not
afford to lose time, even though his adopted sister lay ill under the
shadow of the worsted curtains that shrouded the alcove on the other
side of the little room.

He sat long and patiently, turning the Poison drama into English with
wonderful ease and rapidity; and meekly bearing a deprivation that was
no small one to him, in the loss of his clay pipe, which he was in the
habit of smoking at all hours of the day.

Eleanor awoke at last, and began talking in a rambling, incoherent way
about her father, and the money sent by Mrs. Bannister, and the parting
upon the Boulevard.

The butcher’s wife drew back the curtain, and Richard Thornton went to
the bedside and looked down tenderly at his childish friend.

Her golden-tinted hair was scattered on the pillow, tangled and
roughened by the constant movement of her restless head. Her grey eyes
were feverishly bright, and burning spots blazed upon the cheeks which
had been so deadly pale on the previous night. She knew Richard, and
spoke to him; but the delirium was not over, for she mixed the events
of the present with the Chelsea experiences of long ago, and talked to
her old friend of the Signora, the violin, and the rabbits. She fell
off into a heavy sleep again, after taking the effervescent medicine
sent her by the English surgeon, and slept until nearly twilight.
In these long slumbers her fresh and powerful constitution asserted
itself, and took compensation for the strain that had been made upon it
in the past day or two.

Richard went away in the afternoon, and did not return till late at
night, when the butcher’s wife told him that her charge had been very
restless, and had asked repeatedly for her father.

“What are we to do?” the good woman said, shrugging her shoulders with
a despairing gesture. “Are we to tell her?”

“Not yet,” Richard answered. “Keep her quiet; keep her as quiet as you
can. And if it is positively necessary to tell her anything, say that
her father has been taken ill, away from home, and cannot be brought
back yet. Poor child! it seems so cruel to keep her in suspense, and
still more cruel to deceive her.”

The butcher’s wife promised to do all in her power to keep her patient
quiet. The doctor had sent an opiate. Miss Vane could not sleep too
much, he said.

So another night passed, this time very peacefully for Eleanor, who lay
in a heavy slumber broken by no cruel dreams. She was very, very weak
the next day, for she had scarcely eaten anything since the roll and
coffee which Richard had made her take; and though she was not exactly
delirious, her mind seemed almost incapable of receiving any very vivid
impression. She listened quietly when they told her that her father
could not come home because he was ill.

Richard Thornton came to the Rue de l’Archevêque several times during
this second day of Eleanor’s illness, but he only stayed a few minutes
upon each occasion. He had a great deal to do, he told the butcher’s
wife, who still kept faithfully to her post in the sick room, only
stealing away now and then, while Eleanor was asleep, to attend to her
business.

It was past eleven o’clock that night when the scene-painter came for
the last time. Eleanor had grown worse as the evening advanced, and was
by this time terribly feverish and restless. She wanted to get up and
dress herself, and go to her father. If he was ill, how could they keep
her from him, how could they be so cruel as to keep her from his side?

Then, starting up suddenly from her pillow, she would cry out wildly
that they were deceiving her, and that her father was dead.

But help and comfort were near at hand. When Richard came, he did not
come alone. He brought a lady with him; an elderly grey-headed woman,
dressed in shabby black.

When this lady appeared upon the threshold of the dimly-lighted little
bedchamber, Eleanor Vane suddenly sprang up in her bed, and threw out
her arms with a wild cry of surprise and delight.

“The Signora!” she exclaimed, “the dear, kind Signora!”

The lady took off her bonnet, and then went close up to the bed, and
seating herself on the edge of the mattress, drew Eleanor’s fair head
upon her bosom, smoothing the tangled hair with unspeakable tenderness.

“My poor child!” she murmured again and again. “My poor, poor child!”

“But, dear Signora,” Eleanor cried, wonderingly, “how is it that you
are here? Why didn’t Richard tell me that you were in Paris?”

“Because I have only just arrived, my darling.”

“Only just arrived! Only just arrived in Paris! But why did you come?”

“I came to see you, Eleanor,” the Signora answered, very gently. “I
heard that you were in trouble, my dear, and I have come to you; to
help and comfort you if I can.”

The butcher’s wife had withdrawn into the little sitting-room where
Richard sat in the darkness. Eleanor Vane and the Signora were
therefore quite alone.

Hitherto the invalid’s head had rested very quietly upon her friend’s
bosom, but now she lifted it suddenly and looked full in the Signora’s
face.

“You came to me because I was in trouble,” she said. “How should I
be in trouble so long as my father lives? What sorrow can come to me
while he is safe? He is ill, they say, but he will get better; he will
get better, won’t he? He will be better soon, dear Signora; he will be
better soon?”

She waited for an answer to her breathless questioning, looking
intently in the pale quiet face of her friend; then suddenly, with a
low, wailing cry, she flung up her hands and clasped them wildly above
her head.

“You have all deceived me,” she cried, “you have all deceived me: my
father is dead!”

The Signora drew her arm caressingly round Eleanor Vane, and tried to
shelter the poor burning head once more upon her shoulder; but Eleanor
shrank from her with an impatient gesture, and, with her hands still
clasped above her head, stared blankly at the dead wall before her.

“My dear, my dear,” the Signora said, trying to unclasp the rigid hands
which were so convulsively clasped together. “Eleanor, my dear, listen
to me: for pity’s sake try and listen to me, my own dear love. You must
know, you must have long known, my dear, that heavy sorrows come to us
all, sooner or later. It is the common lot, my love, and we must all
bow before the Divine hand that afflicts us. If there were no sorrow
in this world, Eleanor, we should grow too much in love with our own
happiness; we should be frightened at the approach of grey hairs and
old age; we should tremble at the thought of death. If there were no
better and higher life than this, Eleanor, sorrow and death would
indeed be terrible. You know how very much affliction has fallen to my
share, dear. You have heard me speak of the children I loved; all taken
from me, Nelly, all taken away. If it were not for my dear nephew,
Richard, I should stand quite alone in the world, a desolate old woman,
with no hope on this side of the grave. But when my sons were taken
from me, God raised me up another son in him. Do you think that God
ever abandons us, Eleanor, even when He afflicts us most heavily? I
have lived a long life, my dear, and I tell you NO!”

The Signora waited in vain for some change in the rigid attitude, the
stony face. Eleanor Vane still stared blankly at the dead wall before
her.

“You have all deceived me,” she repeated; “my father is dead!”

It was useless talking to her; the tenderest words were dull and
meaningless jargon to her ears. That night the fever grew worse, and
the delirium was at its height. The butcher’s wife was relieved by a
very patient and accustomed watcher, for the Signora had sat by many
sick-beds, hoping against hope, until despair crept into her heart, as
the grey shadows of approaching death came over a beloved face, never
again to pass away.

The fever lasted for several days and nights, but throughout every
change the English doctor declared that Eleanor Vane’s constitution
would carry her through a worse attack than this.

“I am glad you told her,” he said one morning to the Signora; “there
will be less to tell her by-and-by, when she begins to get strong
again.”

There was, therefore, something more to be told.

       *       *       *       *       *

Little by little the fever passed away; the crimson spots faded out
of the invalid’s hollow cheeks; the unnatural lustre of the grey eyes
grew less and less vivid; little by little the mind grew clearer, the
delirious wanderings less frequent.

But with the return of perfect consciousness there came terrible bursts
of grief—grief that was loud and passionate in proportion to the
impulsive vehemence of Eleanor Vane’s character. This was her first
sorrow, and she could not bear it quietly. Floods of tears drowned her
pillow night after night; she refused to be comforted; she repulsed
the patient Signora; she would not listen to poor Richard, who came
sometimes to sit by her side, and tried his best to beguile her from
her grief. She rebelled against their attempted consolation.

“What was my father to you?” she cried, passionately. “You can afford
to forget him. He was all the world to me!”

But it was not in Eleanor’s nature to be long ungrateful for the
tenderness and compassion of those who were so patient with her in this
dark hour of her young life.

“How good you are to me,” she cried sometimes, “and what a wretch I am
to think so little of your goodness. But you don’t know how I loved my
father. You don’t know—you don’t know. I was to have worked for him; I
was to have worked for him by-and-by, and we were to have led such a
happy life together.”

She was growing strong again, in spite of her grief. Her elastic
temperament asserted itself in spite of her sorrow, which she never
ceased to think of night and day, and she arose after her illness like
a beautiful flower which had been beaten and crushed by the storm.

Richard Thornton’s leave of absence had expired for some days, but the
Royal Phœnix Theatre closed its doors in the hot summer months, and he
was therefore comparatively free. He stayed in Paris with his aunt,
for they were both bent upon one purpose, to be accomplished at any
sacrifice to themselves. Thank Heaven! there are always good Samaritans
in the world, who do not mind turning backward upon their life’s
journey when there is a desolate wounded traveller in need of their
help and tenderness.

The Parisian atmosphere was cooling down in the early days of
September—faint but refreshing breezes were beginning to blow away the
white mists of summer heat upon the Boulevards, when Eleanor Vane was
well enough to sit in the little saloon above the butcher’s shop, and
drink tea in the English fashion with her two friends.

She was well enough to do this, and Richard and the Signora were
beginning to think of turning homewards; but before they could
well leave Paris there was something that ought to be told to
Eleanor—something that she _must_ know sooner or later—something that
it would be perhaps better for her to know at once.

But they had waited from time to time, thinking that she might ask some
question which would lead to the revelation that must ultimately be
made to her.

Upon this September afternoon she sat near the open window, looking
very beautiful and virginal in a loose white muslin dressing-gown, and
with her long auburn curls falling upon her shoulders. She had been
silent for a long time: her two companions watching her furtively,
observant of every change in her countenance. Her cup of tea stood
untasted on a little table at her side, and she was sitting with her
hands loosely locked together in her lap.

She spoke at last, and asked that very question which must inevitably
lead to the revelation her friends had to make to her.

“You have never told me how papa died,” she said; “his death must have
been sudden, I know.”

Eleanor Vane spoke very quietly. She had never before mentioned her
dead father with so little outward evidence of emotion. The hands
loosely locked together upon her lap stirred with a slightly tremulous
motion; the face, turned towards the Signora and Richard Thornton, had
a look of fixed intensity; and that was all.

“Papa died suddenly, did he not?” she repeated.

“Yes, my dear, very suddenly.”

“I thought so. But why was he not brought home? Why couldn’t I see——”

She stopped abruptly, and turned her face away towards the open window.
She was trembling violently now from head to foot.

Her two companions were silent. That terrible something which was at
yet unrevealed must be told sooner or later; but who was to tell it
to this girl, with her excitable nature, her highly-wrought nervous
temperament?

The Signora shrugged her shoulders despondingly as she looked at her
nephew. Mr. Thornton had been painting all the afternoon in the little
sitting-room. He had tried to interest Eleanor Vane in the great set
scenes he was preparing for _Raoul_. He had explained to her the
nature of a vampire trap in the wainscot of the poisoner’s chamber,
and had made his pasteboard model limp in his repeated exhibition of
its machinery. The vampire trap was a subtle contrivance which might
have beguiled any one from their grief, Dick thought; but the wan smile
with which Eleanor watched his work only made the scene-painter’s heart
ache. Richard sighed as he returned his aunt’s look. It seemed quite
a hopeless case as yet. This poor lonely child of fifteen might go
melancholy mad, perhaps, in her grief for a spendthrift father.

Eleanor Vane turned upon them suddenly while they sat silent and
embarrassed, wondering what they should say to her next.

“My father committed suicide!” she said, in a strangely quiet voice.

The Signora started and rose suddenly, as if she would have gone to
Eleanor. Richard grew very pale, but sat looking down at the litter
upon the table, with one hand trifling nervously amongst the scraps of
cardboard and wet paint-brushes.

“Yes,” cried Eleanor Vane, “you have deceived me from first to last.
You told me first that he was not dead; but when you could no longer
keep my misery a secret from me, you only told me half the truth—you
only told me half the cruel truth. And even now, when I have suffered
so much that it seems as if no further suffering could touch me, you
still deceive me, you still try to keep the truth from me. My father
parted from me in health and spirits. Don’t trifle with me, Signora; I
am not a child any longer; I am not a foolish school-girl, whom you can
deceive as you like. I am a woman, and will know the worst. My father
killed himself!”

She had risen in her excitement, but clung with one hand to the back of
her chair, as if too weak to stand without that support.

The Signora went to her, and wound her arms about the slight trembling
figure; but Eleanor seemed almost unconscious of that motherly caress.

“Tell me the truth,” she cried, vehemently; “did my father kill
himself?”

“It is feared that he did, Eleanor.”

The pale face grew a shade whiter, and the trembling frame became
suddenly rigid.

“It is feared that he did!” Eleanor Vane repeated. “It is not certain,
then?”

The Signora was silent.

“Why don’t you tell me the truth?” cried the girl, passionately. “Do
you think you can make my misery less to me by dropping out your words
one by one? Tell me the worst. What can there be worse than my father’s
death; his unhappy death; killed by his own hand, his poor desperate
hand? Tell me the truth. If you don’t wish me to go mad, tell me the
truth at once.”

“I will, Eleanor, I will,” the Signora answered, gently. “I wish to
tell you all. I wish that you should know the truth, sad as it may be
to hear. This is the great sorrow of your life, my dear, and it has
fallen upon you very early. I hope you will try and bear it like a
Christian.”

Eleanor Vane shook her head with an impatient gesture.

“Don’t talk to me of my sorrow,” she cried; “what does it matter what I
suffer? My father, my poor father, what must he have suffered before he
did this dreadful act? Don’t talk about me; tell me of him, and tell me
the worst.”

“I will, my darling, I will; but sit down, sit down, and try to compose
yourself.”

“No, I’ll stand here till you have told me the truth. I’ll not stir
from this spot till I know all.”

She disengaged herself from the Signora’s supporting arm, and with
her hand still resting on the chair, stood resolute before the
old music-mistress and her nephew. I think the Signora and the
scene-painter were both afraid of her, she looked so grand in her
beauty and despair.

She seemed indeed, as she had said, no longer a child or a
school-girl; but a woman, desperate and almost terrible in the
intensity of her despair.

“Let me tell Eleanor the truth of this sad story,” Richard said; “it
may be told very briefly. When your father parted with you, Nelly, on
the night of the 11th of August, he and the two men who were with him
went at once to an obscure café in one of the streets near the Barrière
Saint Antoine. They were in the habit of going there, it seems,
sometimes playing billiards in the large open room on the ground floor,
sometimes playing cards in a _cabinet particulier_ on the entresol.
Upon this night they went straight to the private room. It was about
half-past nine when they went in. The waiter who attended upon them
took them three bottles of Chambertin and a good deal of seltzer-water.
Your father seemed in high spirits at first. He and the dark Englishman
were playing _écarté_, their usual game; and the Frenchman was looking
over your father’s hand, now and then advising his play, now and then
applauding and encouraging him. All this came out upon inquiry. The
Frenchman quitted the café at a little before twelve: your father and
the young Englishman stayed till long after midnight, and towards
one o’clock they were heard at high words, and almost immediately
afterwards the Englishman went away, leaving your father, who sent the
waiter for some brandy and writing materials. He wanted to write a
letter before he left, he said.”

The scene-painter paused, looking anxiously at the face of his
listener. The rigid intensity of that pale young face had undergone no
change; the grey eyes, fixed and dilated, were turned steadily towards
him.

“When the waiter took your father the things he had asked for, he found
him sitting at the table with his face hidden in his hands. The man
placed the brandy and writing materials upon the table, and then went
away, but not before he had noticed a strange faint smell—the smell of
some drug, he thought; but he had no idea then what drug. The waiter
went down stairs; all the ordinary frequenters of the place were gone,
and the lights were out. The man waited up to let your father out,
expecting him to come down stairs every moment. Three o’clock struck,
and the waiter went up-stairs upon the pretence of asking if anything
was wanted. He found your father sitting very much as he had left him,
except that this time his head was resting upon the table, which was
scattered with torn scraps of paper. He was dead, Eleanor. The man gave
the alarm directly, and a doctor came to give assistance, if any could
have been given; but the drug which the waiter had smelt was opium, and
your father had taken a quantity which would have killed the strongest
man in Paris.”

“Why did he do this?”

“I can scarcely tell you, my dear; but your poor father left among
the scraps of paper upon the table, one fragment much larger and more
intelligible than the rest. It is evidently part of a letter addressed
to you; but it is very wildly and incoherently worded; and you must
remember that it was written under circumstances of great mental
excitement.”

“Give it me!”

Eleanor stretched out her hand with an authoritative gesture. Richard
hesitated.

“I wish you to fully understand the nature of this letter before you
read it, Eleanor; I wish——”

“You kept the story of my father’s death from me out of mistaken
kindness,” the girl said, in an unfaltering voice; “I will try and
remember how good you have been to me, so that I may forgive you that;
but you cannot keep from me the letter my father wrote to me before he
died. That is mine; and I claim it.”

“Let her see it, poor child,” said the Signora.

Richard Thornton took a leather memorandum-book from one of the
pockets of his loose coat. There were several papers in this book. He
selected one, and handed it silently to Eleanor Vane. It was a sheet of
letter-paper, written upon in her father’s hand, but a part of it had
been torn away.

Even had the whole of the letter been left, the writer’s style was so
wild and incoherent that it would have been no easy task to understand
his meaning. In its torn and fragmentary state, this scrap of writing
left by George Vane was only a scribble of confused and broken
sentences. The sheet of paper had been torn from the top to the bottom,
so that the end of each line was missing. The following broken lines
were therefore all that Eleanor could decipher, and in these the words
were blotted and indistinct.

      MY POOR ELEANOR,—My poor injured

There was no more. These lines were spread over the first leaf of a
sheet of letter-paper; the second leaf, as well as a long strip of the
first, had been torn away.

This was the only clue to the secret of his death which George Vane had
left behind him.

Eleanor Vane folded the crumpled scrap of paper, and put it tenderly
in her bosom. Then, falling on her knees, she clasped her hands, and
lifted them towards the low ceiling of the little chamber.

“Oh, my God!” she cried; “hear the vow of a desolate creature, who has
only one purpose left in life.”

Signora Picirillo knelt down beside her, and tried to clasp her in her
arms.

“My dear, my dear!” she pleaded; “remember how this letter was
written—remember the state of your father’s mind——”

“I remember nothing,” answered Eleanor Vane, “except that my father
tells me to revenge his murder. For he was murdered,” she cried,
passionately, “if this money—this wretched money, which he would have
died sooner than lose—was taken from him unfairly. He was murdered.
What did the wretch who robbed him care what became of the poor,
broken-hearted, helpless old man whom he had wronged and cheated? What
did he care? He left my father; left him in his desolation and misery;
left him after having stripped and beggared him; left him to die in
his despair. Listen to me, both of you, and remember what I say. I
am very young, I know, but I have learnt to think and act for myself
before to-day. I don’t know this man’s name; I never even saw his face;
I don’t know who he is, or where he comes from; but sooner or later I
swear to be revenged upon him for my father’s cruel death.”

“Eleanor, Eleanor!” cried the Signora: “is this womanly? Is this
Christian-like?”

The girl turned upon her. There was almost a supernatural light, now,
in the dilated grey eyes. Eleanor Vane had risen from her knees, and
stood with her slender figure drawn to its fullest height, her long
auburn hair streaming over her shoulders, with the low light of the
setting sun shining upon the waving tresses until they glittered like
molten gold. She looked, in her desperate resolution and virginal
beauty, like some young martyr of the middle ages waiting to be led to
the rack.

“I don’t know whether it is womanly or Christian-like,” she said, “but
I know that it is henceforward the purpose of my life, and that it is
stronger than myself.”




CHAPTER IX.

LOOKING TO THE FUTURE.


The story which Richard Thornton had told Eleanor Vane was the simple
record of an unhappy truth. The gay and thoughtless spendthrift, the
man about town, who had outlived his age and spent three fortunes, had
ended his life, by his own desperate hand, in an obscure café near the
Barrière Saint Antoine.

Amongst other habits of the age in which George Vane had lived,
gambling was pretty prevalent. Mr. Vane’s sanguine nature was the very
nature which leads a man to the gaming-table, and holds him there under
the demoniac fascination of the fatal green cloth, hoping against hope,
until his pockets are empty, and he must needs crawl dispirited away,
having no more money to lose.

This was the one vice of George Vane’s life. He had tried to redeem his
every-day extravagances by the gamester’s frenzied speculations, the
gamester’s subtle combinations; which are so infallible in theory, so
ruinous in practice. Eleanor had never known this. If her father stayed
out late at night, and she had to wait and watch for him through long
weary hours of suspense and anxiety, she never knew why he stayed, or
why he was often so broken down and wretched when he came home. Other
people could guess the reason of the old man’s midnight absences from
his shabby lodging, but they were too merciful to tell his little girl
the truth. In Paris, in a strange city, where his acquaintance were
few, the old vice grew stronger, and George Vane spent his nights in
gambling for pitiful stakes in any low haunts to which his disreputable
associates deluded him. He picked up strange acquaintance in these days
of his decadence, as poor people very often do: young men who were
wandering about the world, penniless adventurers, professionless young
reprobates, getting a very doubtful living by the exercise of their
wits; men who were content to flatter and pay court to the old beau so
long as they could win a few francs from him to pay for the evening’s
diversion.

With such men George Vane had associated for a long time. They won
pitiful sums of him, and cheated him without scruple; but his life was
a very dull one, remember; he had lived for the world, and society
of some kind or other was absolutely necessary to him. He clung,
therefore, to these men, and was fain to accept their homage in the
hour of his decline; and it was with such men as these he had spent the
night before his death. It was such men as these who had robbed him of
the money which, but for an unhappy accident, would have been safely
handed over to the schoolmistress in the Bois de Boulogne.

The old man’s death caused very little excitement in Paris. Public
gambling-houses had been abolished by the order of the Government
long before; and it was no longer a common thing for desperate men to
scatter their brains upon the table on which they had just squandered
their money; but still people knew very well that there was plenty of
card-playing, and dice throwing, and billiard-playing, always going on
here and there in the brilliant city, and the suicide of a gambler more
or less was not a thing to make any disturbance.

Mrs. Bannister wrote a stiffly-worded letter in reply to that in which
Richard Thornton told her of her father’s death, enclosing an order on
Messrs. Blount for the sum she considered sufficient to pay for the old
man’s funeral, and to support Eleanor for a few weeks.

“I should advise her early return to England,” the stockbroker’s widow
wrote, “and I will endeavour to find her some decent situation—as
nursery governess or milliner’s apprentice, perhaps—but she must
remember that I expect her to support herself, and that she must not
look to me for any further assistance. I have performed my duty to my
father at a considerable loss to myself, but with his death all claim
upon me ceases.”

George Vane had been buried during the early days of his youngest
daughter’s illness. They placed him amongst a cluster of neglected
graves, in a patch of ground upon the outskirts of Père la Chaise, a
burial place for heretics and suicides, and Richard Thornton ordered
a roughly-hewn cross from one of the stonemasons near the cemetery.
So, far away from the lofty monuments of the Russian princes and the
marshals of the First Empire; far away from Abelard and Heloise, and
all the marble chapels in which devoted survivors pray for the souls
of the beloved dead; in a desolate and unhallowed patch of weedy
turf, where the bones of the departed were only suffered to rest
peaceably for a given number of years, and were stirred up out of their
coffins periodically to make room for new-comers, George Vane slept
the last sleep. He might have been buried as a nameless suicide, but
for the chance which had taken Richard Thornton to the Morgue, where
he recognized Eleanor’s father in the unknown man who had been last
brought to that gloomy shelter; for he had had no papers which could
give any clue to his identity about him at the time of his death.

Upon the morning after that quiet September afternoon on which
Eleanor Vane had learned the true story of her father’s death, Signora
Picirillo for the first time spoke seriously of the future. In the
intensity of her first great grief, Eleanor Vane had never once thought
of the desolation of her position, nor yet of the sacrifices which the
Signora and Richard were making for her sake. She never remembered
that they were both lingering in Paris solely on her account: she
only knew that they were there, and that she saw them daily, and that
the sight of them, good and kind as they were, was pain and weariness
to her, like the sight of everything else in the world. She had been
singularly quiet since the revelation made to her. After the first
burst of passionate vehemence which had succeeded her perusal of her
dead father’s letter, her manner had grown almost unnaturally calm. She
had sat all the evening apart near the window, and Richard had tried
in vain to beguile her attention even for a moment. She kept silence,
brooding upon the scrap of paper which lay in her bosom.

This morning she sat in a listless attitude, with her head resting on
her hand. She took no heed of the Signora’s busy movements from room to
room. She made no effort to give her old friend any assistance in all
the little household arrangements which took so long to complete, and
when at last the music-mistress brought her needlework to the window,
and sat down opposite the invalid, Eleanor looked up at her with a dull
gaze that struck despair to the good creature’s heart.

“Nelly, my dear,” the Signora said, briskly, “I want to have a little
serious conversation with you.”

“About what, dear Signora?”

“About the future, my love.”

“The future!” Eleanor Vane uttered the word almost as if it had been
meaningless to her.

“Yes, my dear. You see even I can talk hopefully of the future, though
I am an old woman; but you, who are only fifteen, have a long life
before you, and it is time you began to look forward to it.”

“I do look forward,” Eleanor said, with a gloomy expression upon her
face. “I do look forward to the future; and to meeting that man, the
man who caused my father’s death. How am I to find him, Signora? Help
me in that. You have been kind to me in everything else. Only help me
to do that, and I will love you better than ever I have loved you yet.”

The Signora shook her head. She was a light-hearted, energetic
creature, who had borne very heavy burdens through a long life; but the
burdens had not been able to crush her. Perhaps her unselfishness had
upheld her throughout all her trials. She had thought and cared so much
for other people, that she had had little time left for thinking of
herself.

“My dear Eleanor,” she said, gravely; “this will never do. You must not
be influenced by that fatal letter. Your poor father had no right to
lay the responsibility of his own act upon another man. If he chose to
stake this unfortunate money upon the hazard of a pack of cards, and
lost it, he had no right to charge this man with the consequences of
his own folly.”

“But the man cheated him!”

“As your father thought. People are very apt to fancy themselves
cheated when they lose money.”

“Papa would never have written so positively, if he had not _known_
that the man cheated him. Besides, Richard says they were heard at high
words; that was no doubt when my poor dear father accused this wretch
of being a cheat. He and his companion were wicked, scheming men, who
had good reason to hide their names. They were pitiless wretches, who
had no compassion upon the poor old man who trusted them and believed
in their honour. Are _you_ going to defend them, Signora Picirillo?”

“Defend them, Eleanor? no: they were bad men, I have no doubt. But, my
darling child, you must not begin life with hatred and vengeance in
your heart.”

“Not hate the man who caused my father’s death?” cried Eleanor Vane.
“Do you think I shall ever cease to hate him, Signora? Do you think
that I shall ever forget to pray that the day may come when he and
I will stand face to face, and that he may be as helpless and as
dependent upon my mercy as my father was on his? Heaven help him on
that day! But I don’t want to talk of this, Signora: what is the use of
talking? I may be an old woman, perhaps, before I meet this man; but
surely, surely I shall meet him, sooner or later. If I only knew his
name—if I only knew his name, I think I could trace him from one end of
the earth to the other. Robert Lan—Lan—what?”

Her head sank forward on her breast, and her eyes fixed themselves
dreamily on the sunlit street below the open window. The French poodle,
Fido, lay at her feet, and lifted up his head every now and then to
lick her hand. The animal had missed his master, and had wandered about
the little rooms, sniffing on the thresholds of closed doors, and
moaning dismally for several days after Mr. Vane’s disappearance.

The Signora sighed as she watched Eleanor. What was she to do with this
girl, who had taken a horrible vendetta upon herself at fifteen years
of age, and who seemed as gloomily absorbed in her scheme of vengeance
as any Corsican chieftain?

“My dear,” the music-mistress said presently, with rather a sharp
accent, “do you know that Richard and I will be compelled to leave
Paris to-morrow?”

“Leave Paris to-morrow, Signora!”

“Yes. The Phœnix opens early in October, and our Dick will have all the
scenes to paint for the new piece. Besides, there are my pupils; you
know, my love, they cannot be kept together for ever unless I go back
to them.”

Eleanor Vane looked up with almost a bewildered expression, as if she
had been trying to comprehend all that Signora Picirillo had said; then
suddenly a light seemed to dawn upon her, and she rose from her chair
and flung herself upon a hassock at the feet of her friend.

“Dear Signora,” she said, clasping the music-mistress’s hand in both
her own, “how wicked and ungrateful I have been all this time! I forget
everything but myself and my own trouble. You came over to Paris on
my account. You told me so when I was ill, but I had forgotten, I had
forgotten. And Richard has stopped in Paris because of me. Oh! what can
I do to repay you both—what can I do?”

Eleanor hid her face upon the Signora’s lap, and wept silently. Those
tears did her good; they beguiled her for a little while, at least,
from the one absorbing thought of her father’s melancholy fate.

Signora Picirillo tenderly smoothed the soft ripples of auburn hair
lying on her lap.

“My dear Eleanor, shall I tell you what you can do to make us both very
happy, and to pay us tenfold for any little sacrifice we may have made
on your account?”

“Yes, yes; tell me.”

“You have to choose your pathway in life, Nelly, and to choose it
quickly. In all the world you have only your half-sisters and brothers
to whom you can appeal for assistance. You have some claim upon them,
you know, dear; but I sometimes think you are too proud to avail
yourself of that claim.”

Eleanor Vane lifted her head with a gesture of superb defiance.

“I would starve rather than accept a penny from Mrs. Bannister, or from
her sister or brothers. If they had been different, my father would
never have died as he did. He was deserted and abandoned by all the
world, except his helpless child, who could do nothing to save him.”

“But if you don’t mean to apply to Mrs. Bannister, what will you do,
Nelly?”

Eleanor Vane shook her head hopelessly. The whole fabric of the future
had been shattered by her father’s desperate act. The simple dream of a
life in which she was to have worked for that beloved father was over,
and it seemed to Eleanor as if the future existed no longer; there was
only the sad, desolate present,—a dreary spot in the great desert of
life, bounded by a yawning grave.

“Why do you ask me what I mean to do, Signora?” she said, piteously.
“How does it matter what I do? Nothing I can do will bring my father
back. I will stay in Paris, and get my living how I can, and look for
the man who murdered my father.”

“Eleanor,” cried the Signora, “are you mad? How could you stay in
Paris, when you don’t know a single creature in the whole city? How, in
mercy’s name, could you get your living in this strange place?”

“I could be a nursery-governess; or a nursery-maid; anything! What do I
care how low I sink, if I can only stay here, where I am likely to meet
that man?”

“Eleanor, my dear! For pity’s sake do not delude yourself in this
manner. The man you want to find is an adventurer, no doubt. In Paris
one day, in London another, or away in America perhaps, or at the
farthest extremity of the globe. Do you hope to find this man by
walking about the streets of Paris?”

“I don’t know.”

“How do you expect to meet him?”

“I don’t know.”

“But, Eleanor, be reasonable. It is utterly impossible that you
can remain in Paris. If Mrs. Bannister does not claim the right of
exercising some authority over you, I claim it as your oldest friend.
My dear, you will not refuse to listen to me, will you?”

“No, no, dear Signora. If you think I mustn’t stay in Paris, I’ll go
back to England, to the Miss Bennetts. They’ll give me fifteen pounds a
year as junior teacher. I may as well live with them, if I mustn’t stay
here. I must earn some money, I suppose, before I can even try to find
the man who caused my father’s death. How long it will be before I can
earn anything worth speaking of!”

She sighed wearily, and fell again into a gloomy silence, from which
the poodle vainly tried to arouse her by many affectionate devices.

“Then we may consider it settled, Nelly, my dear,” the Signora said,
cheerfully. “You will leave Paris to-morrow morning, with Richard
and me. You can stay with us, my dear, till you’ve made up your mind
what to do. We’ve a little spare room, which is only used now as a
receptacle for empty boxes and Richard’s painting litter. We’ll fit it
up for you, my darling, and make you as comfortable as we can.”

“Dear, dear Signora!” said Eleanor, kneeling by her friend’s chair.
“How good you are to me! But while I have been ill there must have been
a great deal of money spent: for the doctor, and the jelly, and fruit,
and lemonade you have given me—who found the money, Signora?”

“Your sister, Mrs. Bannister, my dear; she sent some money in answer to
a letter from Richard.”

Eleanor’s face crimsoned suddenly, and the music-mistress understood
the meaning of that angry flush.

“Richard didn’t ask for any money, my love. He only wrote to tell your
sister what had happened. She sent money for all necessary expenses. It
is not all gone yet, Nelly; there will be enough to pay your journey
back to England; and even then something left. I have kept an account
of all that has been spent, and will give it to you when you like.”

Eleanor looked down at her white morning-gown.

“Is there enough left to buy a black frock?” she asked, in a low voice.

“Yes, my darling. I have thought of that. I have had mourning made for
you. The dressmaker took one of your muslin frocks for a pattern, so
there was no occasion to trouble you about the business.”

“How good you are to me, how very, very good!”

Eleanor Vane could only say this. As yet she only dimly felt how
much she owed to these people, who were bound to her by no tie of
relationship, and who yet stepped aside from their own difficult
pathway to do her service in her sorrow. She could not learn to cling
to them, and depend upon them yet. She had loved them long ago, in her
father’s lifetime; but now that he was dead, every link that had bound
her to life, and love, and happiness, seemed suddenly severed, and she
stood alone, groping blindly in the thick darkness of a new and dreary
world, with only one light shining far away at the end of a wearisome
and obscure pathway; and that a lurid and fatal star, which beckoned
her onward to some unknown deed of hate and vengeance.

Heaven knows what vague scheme of retribution she cherished in her
childish ignorance of the world. Perhaps she formed her ideas of life
from the numerous novels she had read, in which the villain was always
confounded in the last chapter, however triumphant he might be through
two volumes and three-quarters of successful iniquity.

George Vane’s sanguine and romantic visions of wealth and grandeur,
of retaliation upon those who had neglected and forgotten him, had
not been without effect upon the mind of his youngest daughter. That
plastic mind had been entirely in the old man’s hands, to mould in
what form he pleased. Himself the slave of impulse, it was not to
be supposed that he could teach his daughter those sound principles
without which man, like a rudderless vessel, floats hither and thither
before every current on the sea of life. He suffered Eleanor’s
impulsive nature to have full away; he put no curb upon the sanguine
temperament which took everything in the extreme. As blindly as the
girl loved her father, so blindly she was ready to hate those whom he
called his enemies. To investigate the nature of the wrongs they had
done him would have been to take their side in the quarrel. Reason and
Love could not go hand-in-hand in Eleanor’s creed; for the questions
which Reason might ask would be so many treacheries against Love.

It is not to be wondered, then, that she held the few broken sentences
written by her father on the threshold of a shameful death, as a solemn
and sacred trust, not to be violated or lost sight of, though her
future life should be sacrificed to the fulfilment of one purpose.

Such thoughts as these—indistinct, ignorant, and childish, perhaps,
but not the less absorbing—filled her mind. It may be that this new
purpose of revenge enabled her the better to endure her loss. She had
something to live for, at least. There was a light far away athwart the
long gloomy pathway through an unknown world; and, however lurid that
guiding star might be, it was better than total darkness.




CHAPTER X.

HORTENSIA BANNISTER HOLDS OUT A HELPING HAND.


Signora Picirillo was very well contented with her morning’s work. She
had obtained Eleanor’s consent to a speedy departure from Paris; that
was the grand point. Once away from the scene of George Vane’s death,
the young girl’s sunshiny nature would reassert itself, and little by
little the great grief would be forgotten.

In all this dreary period of sickness and misery the good
music-mistress had grown to love Mr. Vane’s daughter even more than
she had loved her long ago, when Eleanor’s childish fingers had first
stumbled slowly over the keys of the pianoforte, in a feeble endeavour
to master the grand difficulties of Haydn’s “Surprise.”

The widow’s life had been a very sorrowful one. Perhaps its most
tranquil period had come within the last ten years. It was ten years
since, her Italian husband and her children having one by one died,
she had found herself alone in the world, with a gaunt, long-legged
hobbledehoy of eighteen, her dead sister’s orphan son, for her sole
protector.

This long-legged hobbledehoy was Richard Thornton, the only child of
the Signora’s pretty younger sister and a dashing cavalry officer, who
had married a penniless and obscure girl for the love of her pretty
face, and had died within a couple of years of his marriage, leaving
his widow to drag out the remnant of a fretful, helpless life in
dependence upon her sister. The Signora had been used to carrying other
people’s burthens from a very early age. She was the eldest child of
a clever violinist, for twenty years leader of the orchestra in one
of the principal London theatres; and from babyhood she had been a
brave-hearted self-reliant creature. When her sister died, therefore,
and, with the last words upon her pale, tremulous lips, prayed the
Signora to protect the helpless boy, Richard Thornton, Eliza Picirillo
freely accepted the charge, and promised to perform it faithfully. The
poor faded beauty died with a smile upon her face, and when Signor
Picirillo—who was a teacher of languages at a few suburban schools,
and a lazy good-tempered nonentity—came home that evening, he found
that there was to be another member of his domestic circle, and another
mouth to be fed henceforth.

The Signora’s cruse of oil held out bravely, in spite of the demands
upon it; and by-and-by, when the honest-hearted music-mistress would
otherwise have been terribly desolate, there was Richard, a tall lad,
ready to stand by her sturdily in the battle of life, and as devoted to
her as the most affectionate of sons. The boy had shown considerable
talent at a very early age, but it was a versatile kind of talent,
which did not promise ever to burst forth into the grander gift of
genius. His aunt taught him music, and he taught himself painting,
intending to be something in the way of Maclise or Turner, by-and-by,
and scraping together some of the shillings he earned with his violin
in order to attend a dingy academy somewhere in Bloomsbury.

But the great historical subjects after Maclise—“The Death of the
Bloody Boar at Bosworth,” a grand battle scene, with a lurid sunset
in the background, and Richmond’s face and armour all ablaze with
crimson, lake and gamboge, from the flaming reflection of the skies,
was the _magnum opus_ which poor Dick fondly hoped to see in the Royal
Academy—were not very saleable; and the Turneresque landscapes, nymphs
and ruins, dryads and satyrs, dimly visible through yellow mist and
rose-coloured fog, cost a great deal of time and money to produce, and
were not easily convertible into ready cash. So when Richard had gone
the usual weary round amongst the picture-dealers, and had endured
the usual heart-burnings and agonies which wait upon ambitious youth,
he was glad to accept the brush flung aside by a scene-painter at the
Phœnix, where Dick received a scanty salary as second violinist; a
salary which was doubled when the young man practised the double duty
of second violin and assistant scene-painter.

These simple people were the only friends of Eleanor Vane’s childhood.
They were ready to accept the responsibility of her future welfare now,
when her rich sister would have sent her into the world, lonely and
helpless, to sink to the abject drudgery which well-to-do people speak
so complacently of, when they recommend their poor relations to get an
honest living and trouble them no longer.

Richard Thornton was enraptured at the idea of taking this beautiful
younger sister home with him, although that idea involved the necessity
of working for her till she was able to do something for herself.

“Nothing could be better for us than all this sad business, aunty,”
the scene-painter said, when he called in the Rue de l’Archevêque, and
found his aunt alone in the little sitting-room. Eleanor was lying down
after the morning’s excitement, while her friend packed her slender
wardrobe and made all preparations for departure. “Nothing could be
better for us,” the young man said. “Why, Nell’s golden hair will light
up the Pilasters with perpetual sunshine, and I shall always have a
model for my subject-pictures. Then what a companion she’ll be for
you in the long dreary nights, when I am away at the Phœnix, and how
capitally she’ll be able to help you with your pupils; for, of course,
she plays and sings like anything by this time.”

“But she wants to go back to the people at the Brixton school, Dick.”

“But, Lord bless you, aunty, we won’t let her go,” cried Mr. Thornton;
“we’ll make a prima donna or a leading tragedy-actress, or something of
that kind, of her. We’ll teach her to make a hundred pounds a week out
of her white arms, and her flashing grey eyes. How beautiful she looked
last night when she was on her knees, vowing vengeance against that
scoundrel who won her father’s money. How splendid she looked, with her
yellow hair all streaming over her shoulders, and her eyes flashing
sparks of fire! Wouldn’t she bring the house down, if she did that at
the Phœnix? She’s a wonderful girl, aunty; the sort of girl to set
all London in a blaze some day, somehow or other. Miss Bennett’s and
Brixton, indeed!” cried Richard, snapping his fingers contemptuously;
“you could no more chain that girl down to a governess’s drudgery,
than you could make a flash of forked lightning do duty for a farthing
candle.”

So Eleanor Vane went back to England with her friends. They chose the
Dieppe and Newhaven route for its economy; and over the same sunlit
landscape upon which she had gazed so rapturously less than a month
ago, Eleanor’s eyes wandered now wearily and sadly, seeing nothing but
desolation wherever they looked. She recognized swelling hills and
broad patches of low verdure, winding glimpses of the river, far-away
villages glimmering whitely in the distance, and she wondered at the
change in herself which made all these things so different to her. What
a child she had been a month ago; what a reckless, happy child, looking
forward in foolish certainty to a long life with her father; ignorant
of all sorrows except the petty troubles she had shared with him; ready
to hope for anything in the boundless future; with a whole fairyland of
pleasure and delight spreading out before her eager feet!

Now she was a woman, alone in a horrible desert, over whose dreary
sands she must toil slowly to the end she hoped to reach.

She sat back in a corner of the second-class carriage, with her face
hidden in a veil, and with the dog Fido curled up in her lap. Her
father had been fond of the faithful creature, she remembered.

It was early in the grey bleakness of a September morning when the cab,
carrying Eleanor and her friends, rattled under an archway leading
out of Dudley Street, Bloomsbury, into the queer little retreat
called the Pilasters. The grooms were already at work in the mews,
and the neighbourhood was enlivened by that hissing noise with which
horses are generally beguiled during the trials of the equine toilet.
The chimney-sweep had left his abode and was whooping dismally in
Northumberland Square. Life began early in the Pilasters, and already
the inmates of many houses were astir, and the sharp voices of mothers
clamoured denunciations on the elder daughters who acted as unsalaried
nursemaids to the younger branches of the family.

The place popularly known as the Pilasters is one of the queerest nooks
in London. It consists of a row of tumble-down houses, fronted by a
dilapidated colonnade, and filled with busy life from cellar to attic.
But I do not believe that the inhabitants of the Pilasters are guilty
of nefarious practices, or that vice and crime find a hiding-place in
the cellars below the colonnade. The retreat stands by itself, hidden
between two highly respectable middle-class streets, whose inhabitants
would scarcely tolerate Alsatian habits or Field Lane proclivities in
their near neighbours. Small tradesmen find a home in the Pilasters,
and emerge thence to work for the best families in Dudley Street and
“the Squares.”

Here, amongst small tailors and mantua-makers, cheap eating-houses,
shabby beer-shops, chimney-sweeps and mangles, Signora Picirillo had
taken up her abode, bringing her faded goods and chattels, the remnants
of brighter times, to furnish the first-floor over a shoemaker’s shop.
I am afraid the shoemaker was oftener employed in mending old shoes
than in making new ones, but the Signora was fain to ignore that fact,
and to be contented with her good fortune in having found a very cheap
lodging in a central neighbourhood.

This was a shabbier place than any that Eleanor Vane had ever lived in,
but she showed no distaste for its simple arrangements. The Signora’s
hopes were realized by-and-by. At first the girl sat all day in a
despondent attitude, with the French poodle in her lap, her head
drooping on her breast, her eyes fixed on vacancy, her whole manner
giving evidence of an all-absorbing grief which was nearly akin to
despair. She went to Brixton very soon after her return to England;
but here a cruel disappointment awaited her. The Misses Bennett heard
her sorrowful story with pitiful murmurs of regret and compassion; but
they had engaged a young person as junior teacher, and could do nothing
to help her. She returned to the Pilasters, looking the image of pale
despair; but the Signora and Richard both declared to her that nothing
could be happier for them than her consenting to remain with them.

So it seemed very much as if the Pilasters was to be Eleanor Vane’s
permanent abode. The neighbours had stared at her a great deal at
first, admiring her pale face and flowing hair, and pitying her because
of her black frock; but they were familiar with her now, and gave her
good day in a friendly manner as she passed under the shadow of the
colonnade on her way out or in.

Little by little the air of dull despondency gave way before this young
woman’s earnest desire to be of use to the people who were so kind to
her. She played remarkably well, for she had had plenty of the drudgery
of pianoforte-playing at the Brixton school, and she was able to take
some of the Signora’s pupils off her hands. She sang, too, in a rich
contralto, which promised to be powerful and beautiful by-and-by; and
she practised the ballads in the old operas which the Signora kept,
neatly bound, but yellow with age, in her feeble music-stand.

As her friends had hoped, her sunshiny nature reasserted itself. The
outer evidences of her great sorrow gradually passed away, though the
memory of her loss still filled her mind; the image of her father, and
the thought of that father’s unhappy death, were still for ever present
with her. It was not in her nature to be long reserved or unsocial; and
by-and-by, when she had been nearly six months in her new home, and the
London sparrows were chirping in the bright spring sunshine about the
mews and under the colonnade, Miss Vane began to sing at her work as
she flitted to and fro in the low rooms, dusting the grand pianoforte
and the old china—touching up the frame of Richard’s unsaleable
picture, the flaring battle of Bosworth, which illuminated one side of
the room. Wherever she went the faithful French poodle ran frisking by
her side; whatever sunshine could find its way into the dusky London
chamber seemed to concentrate itself about her golden head. Gaiety,
life, and brightness went with her up and down the dark staircase—in
and out of the dingy rooms. Her youth and beauty turned the shabby
lodgings into a fairy palace, as it seemed to Richard and his aunt.
When she sat down and ran her agile fingers over the piano, dashing
into fantasias and scenas, sparkling and rippling with joyous treble
meanderings among the upper notes, the old Clementi grew young again
beneath her touch, the worn-out strings were revivified by the wondrous
magnetism of her youth and vitality. The flute-like treble trills and
triplets seemed like the joyous chirpings of a hundred birds. The
music-mistress and the scene-painter used to sit and watch her as she
played; their admiring eyes followed her as she flitted to and fro, and
they wondered at her grace and beauty.

She had her father’s aristocratic elegance, her father’s power of
fascination. All the dangerous gifts which had been so fatal to George
Vane, were inherited by his youngest daughter. Like him, a creature
of impulse, spontaneous, sanguine, volatile, she influenced other
people by the force of her own superabundant vitality. In her bright
hopefulness she made an atmosphere of hope in which other people grew
hopeful. The dullest rejoiced in her joyous vivacity, her unconscious
loveliness. Yes, perhaps Eleanor Vane’s greatest charm lay in her
utter ignorance of the fact that she was charming. In the three years’
drudgery of a boarding-school she had never learned the power of her
own fascination. She knew that people loved her, and she was grateful
to them for their affection; but she had never discovered that it was
by some wondrous magnetic attraction inherent in herself that she
obtained so much love and devotion.

Nobody had ever taken the trouble to tell her that she was beautiful.
She had generally worn shabby frocks, and the rippling golden hair had
not very often been smooth; so perhaps the school-girls at Brixton
scarcely knew how lovely their companion was. The delicate aquiline
profile, the flashing grey eyes, pale face, red lips, and amber hair,
were counterbalanced by the silk dresses and lace furbelows of young
ladies, whose wealthy fathers paid full price for their education.
Poverty learns its place in the little world of a young ladies’
boarding-school quite as surely as in the larger world beyond the
garden wall which bounds that establishment. But Eleanor had held
her own at the Misses Bennett’s seminary, by some mysterious power
against which her richer companions had in vain rebelled. Her frank
acknowledgment of her poverty, coupled with the fact of her father’s
former wealth and grandeur, perhaps enabled her to do this. If she
wore shabby frocks, she looked more aristocratic in her shabbiness
than the other young ladies in their stiff silks and prim finery. They
recognized this fact, they acknowledged something in their playfellow
which lifted her above themselves, and the half-boarder dealt out
patronage and regal condescensions to the most remunerative pupils in
the school. She reigned by reason of her unacknowledged beauty, and
that divine something, dimly recognized by all about her, but as yet
wholly undeveloped. The school-girl was clever, brilliant, fascinating,
but it was yet to be discovered what the woman would be. It was yet
to be discovered whether these budding qualities would develope into
the many flowers of a bright and versatile mind, or burst forth
suddenly and mysteriously into that rare tropical blossom, that mental
once-in-a-century-flourishing aloe, which men call Genius. The good
music-mistress watched her young protégée with love and wonder, not
unalloyed by fear. What was she to do with this strange and beautiful
bird which she had brought home to her nest? Would it be right to
fetter this bright spirit for ever? Was it fair to immure all this
joyous loveliness in that shabby lodging; to stifle such superabundant
vitality in the close atmosphere of a dull and monotonous existence?

The faithful creature had been accustomed to consider others, and she
thought of this seriously and constantly. Eleanor was contented and
happy. She was earning money now by giving lessons here and there, and
she contributed to the family purse. The days slipped by very rapidly,
as it seemed, in that peaceful monotony. Miss Vane’s frocks appeared
to grow shorter and shorter as the young lady sprang up into bright
womanhood. She was nearly seventeen now, and had been more than a year
and a half living under the shadow of the Bloomsbury Pilasters. Richard
and his aunt consulted together as to what her future life ought to be;
but they never came nearer to any conclusion.

“It’s all very well to talk of her going away from us, you know,
aunty,” the scene-painter said; “but what are we to do without her?
All the sunshine and poetry of our lives will go away with her when
she leaves us! Besides! what is she to be? A governess? Bah! who would
doom her to that ladylike imagery? An actress? No, aunty carissima, I
should never like to see that bright young beauty behind the glare of
the foot-lights. I think I’d rather she should live here for ever and
ever, than that her nature should ever be vulgarized by contact with
the world. Let us keep her, aunty; she doesn’t want to leave us. Those
who have any actual claim upon her have abandoned her. She came across
my pathway like some wandering homeless angel. I shall never forget her
face when I first saw it on the lamplit boulevard, and recognized the
little girl I had known three years before in the fair-haired young
beauty of fifteen. She doesn’t want to go away. Why should you talk of
her leaving us, aunty dear?”

Signora Picirillo shrugged her shoulders with a sigh.

“Heaven knows I have no wish to part with her, Dick,” she said; “but
we ought to do what’s right for her sake. This is no place for George
Vane’s daughter.”

But while the music-mistress and her nephew were speculating and
theorizing upon the future of their protégée, practical Mrs.
Bannister was contemplating the infliction of a death-blow which was
to shatter the happiness of the humble Bloomsbury circle with one
merciless stroke. Early in the bleak March of 1855, Eleanor received
a coldly-worded epistle from her half-sister, to the effect that an
opportunity had now arisen for her advancement in life; and that if
she wished ever to attain a _respectable_ position—the adjective was
mercilessly underlined—she would do well to avail herself of it. For
further information and advice she was to call early the next morning
in Hyde Park Gardens. Miss Vane would fain have left this letter
unanswered, and at first stoutly refused to obey Mrs. Bannister’s
summons.

“What do I want with her condescension and patronage?” she said,
indignantly. “Does she think that I forget the cruel letter she wrote
to my father; or that I forgive her for its heartless insolence?
Let her keep her favours for those who solicit them. I want nothing
from her. I only want to be left in peace with the friends I love.
Do you wish to get rid of me, Signora, that you persuade me to dance
attendance upon Mrs. Bannister?”

It was very hard for poor Signora Picirillo to be compelled to urge
the child’s acceptance of the hand so coldly extended to her, but
the good creature felt that it was her duty to do so, and Miss Vane
loved her protectress far too dearly to persist in opposing her.
She went, therefore, early the next morning to her half-sister’s
house at Bayswater, where the spacious rooms seemed doubly spacious
when compared with the little sitting-room over the colonnade,
the sitting-room which was more than half filled by Clementi’s
old-fashioned piano. Here the gorgeous Erard’s grand, in a case of
carved walnut wood and ebony, and with all manner of newfangled
improvements, was only an oasis upon the great desert of velvet piles.

Hortensia Bannister was pleased to be very gracious to her half-sister.
Perhaps she was all the more so because Eleanor made no pretence of
affection for her. This cold, hard-natured woman would have been
suspicious of mercenary motives lurking beneath any demonstration of
sisterly love.

“I am glad to hear you have been learning to get your own living,
Eleanor,” she said, “and above all, that you have been cultivating
your talent for the piano. I have not forgotten you, you will find.
The people with whom you have been living sent me their address
when they brought you from Paris, and I knew where to find you when
any opportunity should present itself for your advancement. This
opportunity has now presented itself. My old acquaintance, Mrs.
Darrell, the niece of your father’s friend, Maurice de Crespigny,
who is still living, though very old and infirm, has written to me
saying that she requires a young person who would act as companion and
musical governess to a lady who lives with her. This young lady is no
relation of Mrs. Darrell’s, but is a kind of ward or pupil, I believe.
Your youth, in this instance, Eleanor, happens to be an advantage, as
the young lady requires a companion of her own age. You will receive
a moderate salary, and will be treated as a member of the family. Let
me hear you play, by the bye, in order that I may be able to speak
positively as to your qualifications.”

Eleanor Vane sat down to the piano. The strings of the Erard vibrated
under her touch. She was almost frightened at the grand tones that came
out of the instrument as she dashed over the keys. She played very
brilliantly, however, and her sister condescended to say so.

“I think I may conscientiously give a good account of your playing,”
she said. “You sing, I suppose?”

“Oh, yes.”

“Very well, then; I think you may consider the engagement a settled
thing. There is only one question to arrange. Of course you must be
aware that the position which your father occupied was once a very
elevated one. Mrs. Darrell and her sisters knew your father in his most
prosperous days, and lost sight of him before he became poor. They know
nothing of his second marriage, or of your birth. His most intimate
friend was Mr. de Crespigny, the uncle of the lady whose house I wish
you to enter. Under these circumstances you cannot wonder when I tell
you that I should strongly object to Mrs. Darrell’s knowing who you
really are.”

“How do you mean, Hortensia?”

“I mean that I shall recommend you as a young person in whose career I
feel interested. If you go to Hazlewood at all, you must go under an
assumed name.”

“Hortensia!”

“Well!” cried Mrs. Bannister, lifting her handsome black eyebrows.

“I don’t want this situation, and I should hate to take a false name. I
would rather stay with my friends, please. I love them very dearly, and
am very happy with them.”

“Good Heavens!” exclaimed Mrs. Bannister, “what is the use of trying
to do some people a service? Here have I been scheming as to how I
could manage to avail myself of this chance, and now this ungrateful
girl turns round and tells me she doesn’t want the situation. Do you
know what you are refusing, Eleanor Vane? Have you learnt your father’s
habit of pauperism, that you prefer to be a burden upon this penniless
music-teacher and her son, or nephew, or whatever he is, rather than
make an honest effort to get your own living?”

Eleanor started up from the piano: she had been sitting before it until
now, softly fingering the keys, and admiring the beauty of the tones.
She started up, looking at her sister, and blushing indignantly to the
very roots of her auburn hair.

Could this be true? Could she be indeed a burden to the friends she
loved so dearly?

“If you think that, Hortensia,” she said, “if you think I am any burden
to the dear Signora, or Richard, I will take any situation you like,
however hard. I’ll toil night and day, and work my fingers to the bone,
rather than be a trouble or a burden to them any longer.”

She remembered how little she earned by her few pupils. Yes, Hortensia
was no doubt right. She was a burden to those good people who had taken
her to their home in her hour of desolation and misery.

“I’ll take the situation, Hortensia,” she cried. “I’ll take a false
name. I’ll do anything in the world rather than impose upon the
goodness of my friends.”

“Very well,” answered Mrs. Bannister, coldly. “Pray do not let us have
any heroics about it. The situation is a very good one, I can assure
you; and there are many girls who would be glad to snap at such a
chance. I will write to my friend, Mrs. Darrell, and recommend you to
her notice. I can do no more. I cannot, of course, ensure you success;
but Ellen Darrell and I were great friends some years since, and I know
that I have considerable influence with her. I’ll write and tell you
the result of my recommendation.”

Eleanor left Hyde Park Gardens after taking two or three sips of some
pale sherry which her half-sister gave her. The wine seemed of a sorry
vintage, and tasted very much as if the grapes of which it was made had
never seen the sun. Miss Vane was glad to set down her wine-glass and
escape from the cold splendour of her half-sister’s drawing-room.

She walked slowly and sorrowfully back to Bloomsbury. She was to leave
her dear friends there—leave the shabby rooms in which she had been
so happy, and to go out into the bleak world a dependant upon grand
people, so low and humiliated that even her own name must be abandoned
by her before she could enter upon the state of dependence. The
Bohemian sociality of the Pilasters was to be exchanged for the dreary
splendour of a household in which she was to be something a little
above the servants.

But it would be cowardly and selfish to refuse this situation, for no
doubt cruel Mrs. Bannister had spoken the truth. Eleanor began to think
that she had been a burden upon her poor friends.

She was very gloomy and despondent, brooding upon these things; but
through every gloomy thought of the present a darker image loomed,
far away in the black future. This was the image of her vengeance, the
vague and uncertain shadow that had filled her girlish dreams ever
since the great sorrow of her father’s death had fallen upon her.

“If I go to Hazlewood,” she thought, “if I spend my life at Mrs.
Darrell’s, how can I ever hope to find the murderer of my father?”




CHAPTER XI.

RICHARD THORNTON’S PROMISE.


Eleanor Vane looked very sadly at all the common everyday sights
connected with the domestic economy of the Pilasters, when she went
back to Bloomsbury after her interview with Mrs. Bannister. She had
only lived a year and a half in that humble locality, but it was in
her nature to become quickly attached to places as well as persons,
and she had grown very fond of the Pilasters. Everybody about the
place knew her and loved her. The horses looked out of their open
stable-doors as she passed; the dogs came tumbling from their kennels,
dragging half-a-dozen yards of rusty iron chain and a heap of straw at
their heels, to greet her as she went by; the chimney-sweeps’ children
courted her notice; and at all the little shops where she had been wont
to give orders and pay bills for the Signora, the simple tradespeople
tendered her their admiration and homage. Her beauty was a pride to the
worthy citizens of the Pilasters. Could all Bloomsbury, from Dudley
Street to the Squares, produce sunnier golden hair, or brighter grey
eyes than were to be seen under the shadow of the dilapidated colonnade
when Eleanor Vane went by?

In this atmosphere of love and admiration, the girl had been very
happy. She had one of those natures in which there lies a wondrous
power of assimilation with the manners and habits of others. She was
never out of place; she was never in the way. She was not ambitious.
Her sunny temperament was the centre of perpetual peace and happiness,
only to be disturbed by very terrible thunderclaps of sorrow. She had
been very happy with the Signora; and to-day she looked sadly round
the little sitting-room, her eyes resting now on the old piano, now on
a shelf of tattered books—romances dear to Richard and herself, and
not too well treated by either—now on the young man’s flaming _magnum
opus_, the picture she had loved to criticise and abuse in mischievous
enjoyment of the painter’s anguish. As she looked at these things, and
remembered how soon she must go away from them, the slow tears trickled
down her cheeks, and she stood despondent on the gloomy threshold of
her new life.

She had found the familiar rooms empty upon her return from Bayswater,
for the Signora was away teaching beyond the regions of the New Road,
and Richard was hard at work at the Phœnix, where there were always new
pieces to be produced and new scenes to be painted. Eleanor had the
little sitting-room all to herself; she took off her bonnet and sat
down upon the old-fashioned chintz-covered sofa. She buried her head in
the cushions and tried to think.

The prospect of a new existence, which would have been delightful to
most girls of her age, was utterly distasteful to her. Her nature was
adhesive; she would have gone to the farthest end of the world with
her father, if he had lived, or with Richard and the Signora, whom she
loved only less than she had loved him. But to sever every tie, and go
out alone into the world, with nothing between her and desolation, was
unspeakably terrible to this affectionate, impulsive girl.

If it had been simply a question of her own advantage, if by the
sacrifice of her own advancement, her every prospect in life, she might
have stayed with the friends she loved, she would not have hesitated
for a moment. But it was not so. Mrs. Bannister had clearly told her
that she was a burden upon these generous people, who had sheltered and
succoured her in her hour of misery. The cruel word pauperism had been
flung in her teeth, and with a racking brain this poor girl set herself
to calculate how much her maintenance cost her friends, and how much
she was able to contribute out of her own pitiful earnings.

Alas! the balance told against her when the sum was done. Her earnings
were very, very small as yet, not because her talent was unappreciated,
but because her pupils were poor; and a music-mistress whose address
was Bloomsbury Pilasters could scarcely demand high payment for her
services, or hope to obtain a very aristocratic connection.

No; Mrs. Bannister—stern, uncompromising, and disagreeable as the
truth itself—had no doubt been right. Her duty lay before her, plainly
indicated by that unpleasant monitor. She was bound to leave these dear
friends, and to go out into the world to fight a lonely battle for
herself.

“I may be able to do something for them,” she thought; and this thought
was the only gleam of light which illumined the darkness of her
sorrow. “I may be able to save money enough to buy the Signora a black
silk dress, and Richard a meerschaum. I should so like to buy Dick a
meerschaum; I know the one he’d like—a bull-dog’s head, with a silver
collar round the neck. We looked at it one night at a shop in Holborn.”

She rose from the sofa at last with an aching heart and troubled
brain, when the early shadows of the spring twilight were gathering
in the room. She made up the fire and swept the hearth, and arranged
the tea-things on the comfortable round table, and then sat down on a
low stool by the fender to toast great rounds of bread, which would
be as nothing in comparison to Richard’s all-devouring capacity after
a hard day’s work in the scene-room at the Phœnix. How pleasant it
was to perform all these little familiar offices of love and duty!
How sorrowfully she looked back to her simple, free-and-easy life,
now that she was to go amongst strangers who would exact all manner
of ceremonious observances from her! The Bohemianism of her existence
had been its greatest charm; and this poor benighted girl trembled at
the prospect of a life in which she would have to go through all those
terrible performances which she had read of, fearfully and wonderingly,
in certain erudite essays upon Etiquette, but which had never yet come
within the range of her experiences.

“It is my duty to go away from them,” she kept saying to herself; “it
is my duty to go away.”

She had schooled herself in this difficult duty by the time her friends
came home, and she told them very quietly that she had seen Mrs.
Bannister, and had agreed to accept her patronage and services.

“I am going to be a sort of companion or musical governess—I scarcely
know which—to a young lady at a country house called Hazlewood,” she
said. “Don’t think I am not sorry to leave you, dear Signora, but
Hortensia says it is better that I should do so.”

“And don’t think that I am not sorry to lose you, Nelly, when I tell
you that I think your sister is right,” the Signora answered gently, as
she kissed her protégée.

Perhaps Eleanor was a little disappointed at this reply. She little
dreamed how often Eliza Picirillo had struggled against the selfishness
of her affection before she had grown thus resigned to this parting.

Mr. Richard Thornton groaned aloud.

“I shall go out and pull down a couple of the Pilasters, and bury
myself under them, à la Samson,” he said, piteously. “What is to
become of us without you, Eleanor? Who will come over to the Phœnix,
and applaud my great scenes with the ferule of an umbrella? Who’ll cut
up half-quartern loaves into toast when I am hungry, or have Welsh
rarebits in readiness on the hob when I come home late at night? Who’ll
play Mendelssohn’s ‘Songs without Words’ to me, and darn my stockings,
and sew buttons—absurd institutions, invented by ignorant people, who
have never known the blessing of pins—upon my shirts? Who’ll abuse me
when I go unshaven, or recommend blacking as an embellishment for my
boots? Who’ll career in and out of the room with a dirty white French
poodle at her heels, looking like a fair-haired Esmeralda with a
curly-coated goat? What are we to do without you, Eleanor?”

There was a sharp pain at poor Dick’s heart as he apostrophized his
adopted sister. Were his feelings quite brotherly? Was there no twinge
of the fatal torture so common to mankind mingled with this young
man’s feelings as he looked at the beautiful face opposite to him, and
remembered how soon it would have vanished from that shabby chamber,
leaving only dismal emptiness behind?

The Signora looked at her nephew and sighed. Yes, it was far better
that Eleanor should go away. She could never have grown to love this
honest-hearted, candid, slovenly scene-painter, whose coat was a
perfect landscape in distemper by reason of the many-coloured splashes
which adorned it.

“My poor Dick would have fallen in love with her, and would have broken
his good honest heart,” Eliza Picirillo said. “I’m very glad she’s
going away.”

So from the road which Destiny had appointed for her to tread, there
was not one voice to call Eleanor Vane aside. The affectionate and the
indifferent alike conspired to urge her onward. It was only her own
inclination that would have held her back.

“If I could have stayed in London,” she thought, “there might have been
some chance of my meeting that man. All scamps and villains come to
hide themselves in London. But in a quiet country village I shall be
buried alive. When I pass the threshold of Mrs. Darrell’s house, I bid
good-bye to the hope of crossing that man’s pathway.”

The letter came very quickly from Mrs. Bannister. Mrs. Darrell had
accepted her dear friend’s recommendation, and was ready to receive
Miss Vincent. It was under this name the stockbroker’s widow had
introduced her half-sister to the notice of her friend.

“You will receive a salary of thirty pounds a year,” Hortensia
Bannister wrote, “and your duties will be very light. Do not forget
that your name at Hazlewood is to be Vincent, and that you are
carefully to avoid all reference to your father. You will be amongst
people who knew him well, and must therefore be on your guard. I
have described you as the orphan daughter of a gentleman who died in
reduced circumstances, and have thus strictly adhered to the truth. No
questions will be asked of you, as Mrs. Darrell is satisfied with my
recommendation, and is too well bred to feel any vulgar curiosity as to
your past history. I send you, per parcel delivery, a box of dresses
and other wearing apparel, which will be of use to you. I also send
you five pounds for such little extra expenditure as may be necessary.
Hazlewood is thirty miles from London, and about seven from Windsor.
You will go down by the Great Western, and stop at Slough, where a
conveyance will meet you; but I will write further upon this matter
before you go. Mrs. Darrell has kindly accorded you a fortnight’s delay
for such preparations as you may require to make. You will be expected
at Hazlewood on the 6th of April.

“I have only one other remark to make. I know that your father
cherished a foolish notion upon the subject of the Woodlands property.
Pray bear in mind that no such idea has ever been entertained by me.
I know the Darrell family quite well enough to feel assured that they
will take care of their own rights, which I am content to acknowledge.
Remember, therefore, that I have no wish or expectation with regard to
Maurice de Crespigny’s will; but it is, on the other hand, perfectly
true, that in his youth he did make a solemn promise that, in the event
of his dying a bachelor, he would leave that money to my father or his
heirs.”

Eleanor Vane took very little notice of this final paragraph in her
sister’s letter. Who cared for Maurice de Crespigny’s fortune? What was
the good of it _now_? It could not bring her father back to life; it
could not blot out that quiet, unwitnessed death-scene in the Parisian
café; it could not rehabilitate the broken name, or restore the
shattered life. What could it matter who inherited the useless dross?

The fortnight passed in a feverish unsatisfactory manner. Richard and
the Signora took care to conceal the poignancy of their regret at
parting with the girl who had brought such new brightness into their
narrow lives. Eleanor wept by stealth; dropping many bitter tears over
her work, as she remodelled Mrs. Bannister’s silk dresses, reducing
those garments to the dimensions of her own girlish figure. The last
night came by-and-by, the night of the 5th of April, the eve of a
sorrowful parting, and the beginning of a new existence.

It happened to be a Sunday evening, and Eleanor and Richard walked
out together in the quiet Bloomsbury streets while the bells were
ringing for evening service, and the lamps glimmering dimly from the
church windows. They chose the loneliest streets in the old-fashioned
middle-class quarter. Eleanor was very pale, very silent. This evening
walk had been her express desire, and Richard watched her wonderingly.
Her face had an expression which he remembered in the Rue de
l’Archevêque, when he had told her the story of her father’s death—an
unnaturally rigid look, strangely opposed to the changeful brightness
common to that youthful countenance.

They had strolled slowly hither and thither in the deserted streets
for some time. The bells had ceased ringing, and the church-goers had
all disappeared. The grey twilight was stealing into the streets and
squares, and the lights began to shine out from the lower windows.

“How quiet you are, Nelly,” Richard said at last; “why were you so
anxious that we should come put together alone, my dear? I fancied you
had something particular to say to me.”

“I have something particular to say.”

“What about?” asked Mr. Thornton.

He looked thoughtfully at his companion. He could only see her
profile—that clearly-defined, almost classical outline—for she had not
turned towards him when she spoke. Her grey eyes looked straight before
her into empty space, and her lips were tightly compressed.

“You love me, don’t you, Richard?” she asked presently, with a
suddenness that startled the scene-painter.

Poor Dick blushed crimson at that alarming inquiry. How could she be so
cruel as to ask him such a question? For the last fortnight he had been
fighting with himself—sturdily and honestly—in the heroic desire to put
away this one fatal thought from his mind; and now the girl for whose
sake he had been doing battle with his own selfishness, struck the
tenderest of all chords with her ignorant hand, and wounded her victim
to the very quick.

But Miss Vane had no consciousness of the mischief she had done.
Coquetry was an unknown science to this girl of seventeen. In all
matters connected with that womanly accomplishment she was as much a
child, now that her seventeenth birthday was past, as she had been in
the old days at Chelsea when she had upset Richard’s colour-boxes and
made grotesque copies of his paintings.

“I know you love me, Dick,” she continued, “quite as much as if I were
your real sister, instead of a poor desolate girl who flung herself
upon you and yours in the day of her affliction. I know you love me,
Dick, and would do almost anything for my sake, and I wanted to speak
to you to-night alone, because I am going to say something that would
distress the dear Signora, if she were to hear it.”

“What is it, my dear?”

“You remember the story of my father’s death?”

“Only too well, Eleanor.”

“And you remember the vow I made when you told me that story, Richard?”

The young man hesitated.

“Yes, I do remember, Nelly,” he said, after a pause; “but I had hoped
that you had forgotten that foolish vow. For it was foolish, you know,
my dear, as well as unwomanly,” the young man added, gravely.

Eleanor’s eyes flashed defiance upon her friend, as she turned to him
for the first time that evening.

“Yes,” she cried, “you thought that I had forgotten, because I was
not always talking of that man who caused my father’s death! You
thought my sorrow for my father was only childish grief, that was to
be forgotten when I turned my back upon the country where he lies in
his abandoned grave—his unconsecrated grave! You thought that nobody
would ever try to avenge the poor, lonely old man’s murder—for it was a
murder, Richard Thornton! What did the wretch who robbed him care for
the anguish of the heart he broke? What did he care what became of his
victim? It was as base and cruel a murder as was ever done upon this
earth, Richard, though the world would not call it by that name.”

“Eleanor, my dear Eleanor! why do you talk of these things?”

The girl’s voice had risen with the vehemence of her passion, and
Richard Thornton dreaded the effect which this kind of conversation
might have upon her excitable nature.

“Nelly, my dear,” he said, “it would be better to forget all this. What
good can you do by cherishing these painful recollections? You are
never likely to meet this man; you do not even know his name. He was a
scamp and an adventurer, no doubt; he may be dead by this time. He may
have done something to bring himself within the power of the law, and
he may be in prison, or transported.”

“He may have done something to bring himself within the power of the
law,” repeated Eleanor. “What do you mean?”

“I mean that he may have committed some crime for which he could be
punished.”

“Could he be punished by the law for having cheated my father at cards?”

“That sort of charge is always difficult to be proved, Nell; impossible
to be proved after the fact. No, I’m afraid the law could never touch
him for that.”

“But if he were to commit some other crime, he might be punished?”

“Of course.”

“If I met him, Richard,” cried Eleanor Vane, with a dangerous light
kindling in her eyes, “I would try and lure him on to commit some
crime, and then turn round upon him and say, ‘The law of the land
could not avenge my father’s death, but it can punish you for a lesser
crime. I have twisted the law to my own purpose, and made it redress my
father’s wrongs.’”

Richard Thornton started aghast at his companion.

“Why, Eleanor,” he exclaimed, “you talk like a Red Indian! This is
quite shocking! You frighten me, really; you do, indeed.”

“I am sorry for that, Richard,” Miss Vane answered, meekly. She was a
child in all things which concerned her affections alone. “I wouldn’t
grieve you or the dear Signora for the world. But there are some
things that are stronger than ourselves, Richard; and the oath that
I took a year and a half ago, in the Rue de l’Archevêque, is one of
those things. I have never forgotten, Dick. Night after night—though
I’ve been happy and light-hearted enough in the day, for I could not
be otherwise than happy with you and the Signora—night after night I
have lain awake thinking of my father’s death. If that death had been
a common one; if he had died in my arms at the will of God, instead
of by the cruelty of a wretch, my grief might have worn itself out
by this time. But as it is, I cannot forget—I cannot forgive. If all
the Christian people in the world were to talk to me, I could never
have one merciful feeling towards this man. If he were going to be
hung to-morrow, I should be glad, and could walk barefoot to the
place of his execution to see him suffer. There is no treachery that
I should think base if employed against him. There is no slow torture
I could inflict upon him that would seem cruel enough to satisfy
my hatred of him. Think what a helpless old man my father was; a
broken-down gentleman; the sort of man whom everybody pities, whom
everybody respects. Remember this; and then remember the cold-blooded
deliberation of the wretch who cheated him out of the money which was
more than money to him—which represented honour—honesty—his child’s
future—all he valued. Remember the remorseless cruelty of the wretch
who looked on while this helpless old man suffered a slow agony of six
or seven hours’ duration, and then left him alone in his despair. Think
of this, Richard Thornton, and don’t wonder any longer if my feelings
towards this man are not _Christian-like_.”

“My dear Eleanor, if I regret the vehemence of your feeling upon this
subject, I do not defend the man whose treachery hurried your father to
his unhappy death; I only wish to convince you of the folly you commit
in cherishing these ideas of vengeance and retribution. Life is not
a three-volume novel or a five-act play, you know, Nelly. The sudden
meetings and strange coincidences common in novels are not very general
in our everyday existence. It is not at all likely that in the whole
course of your life you will ever again encounter this man. From the
moment of your father’s death all clue to him was lost; for it was only
your father who could have told us who and what he was, or, at least,
who and what he represented himself to be. He is lost in the vast
chaos of humanity now, my dear, and you have not the frailest clue by
which you might hope to find him. For Heaven’s sake, then, abandon all
thought of an impossible revenge! Have you forgotten the words we heard
in the Epistle a few weeks ago—‘Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith
the Lord’? If the melodramatic revenge of the stage is not practicable
in real life, we know at least, my dear—for you see we have it from
very high authority—that wicked deeds do not go unpunished. Far away
at the remotest limits of the earth, this man, whom your puny efforts
would be powerless to injure, may suffer for his crime. Try and think
of this, Eleanor.”

“_I cannot_,” answered the girl. “The letter which my father wrote me
before he died was a direct charge which I will never disobey. The only
inheritance I received from him was that letter—that letter in which
he told me to avenge his death. I dare say you think me mad as well as
wicked, Richard; but, in spite of all you have said, _I believe that I
shall meet that man!_”

The scene-painter sighed and relapsed into despondent silence. How
could he argue with this girl? What could he do but love and admire
her, and entrust himself to her direction if she had need of a slave?
While he was thinking this, Eleanor clasped both her hands upon his arm
and looked up earnestly in his face.

“Richard,” she said, in a low voice, “I think you would serve me if you
had the power.”

“I would go through fire and water to do so, Nelly.”

“I want you to help me in this matter. You know as little of this man
as I do, but you are much cleverer than me. You mix with other people
and see something of the world; not much, I know, but still a great
deal more than I do. I am going away into a quiet country place, where
there is no possible chance of meeting this man; you will stay in
London”——

“Where I may brush against him in the streets any day, Nell, without
being a shade the wiser as to his identity. My dear child, for any
practical purpose you will be as near the man in Berkshire as I shall
be in Bloomsbury. Don’t let’s talk of him any longer, Nelly. I can’t
tell you how this subject distresses me.”

“I won’t leave off talking of him,” said the young lady, resolutely,
“until you have made me a promise.”

“What promise?”

“That if ever you do come across any clue which may lead to the
identification of the man I want to find, you will follow it up,
patiently and faithfully, sparing neither trouble nor cost. For my
sake, Richard, for my sake, will you promise?”

“I will, my dear,” Mr. Thornton answered. “I do promise, and I will
keep my promise honestly if ever the chance of doing so should come to
me. But I must tell you frankly, Nell, I don’t believe it ever will.”

“Bless you for the promise, notwithstanding, Richard,” Eleanor said,
warmly. “It has made me much happier. There will be two people
henceforth, instead of one, set against this man.”

A dark frown overshadowed her face. It seemed as if she had uttered
those last few words in the form of a threat and a defiance, which the
man, whoever he was, and wherever he was, might hear.

“You know all the strange things they say now about second-sight,
clairvoyance, odic force, magnetic attraction—all sorts of long words
whose meaning I don’t understand, Richard. I wonder sometimes if this
man _knows_ that I hate him, and that I am watching for him, thinking
of him, praying to meet him day and night. Perhaps he does know this,
and will hold himself on his guard against me, and try and avoid me.”

Richard shrank from entering upon this subject; the conversation had
been altogether disagreeable to him. There was a horrible discrepancy
between this girl’s innocent youthful beauty and all this determined
talk of fierce and eager vengeance, which would have been more natural
to a Highland or Corsican chieftain than to a young lady of seventeen.

It was dark now, and they went back to the Pilasters, where Eliza
Picirillo was spending that last night very mournfully. The shabby room
was only illumined by the glimmer of a low fire, for the Signora had
not cared to light the candles until her two children came home. She
had been sitting by the dingy window watching for their return, and had
fallen asleep in the darkness.

There is no need to dwell upon that last night. It was like the eves of
all partings, very sad, very uncomfortable. Everything was disorganized
by that approaching sorrow. Conversation was desultory and forced, and
Richard was glad to be employed in cording Eleanor’s boxes. She had
two trunks now, and had a wardrobe that seemed to her magnificent, so
liberally had Mrs. Bannister bestowed her cast-off dresses upon her
half-sister.

So the last night passed away, the April morning came, and Eleanor’s
new life began.




CHAPTER XII.

GILBERT MONCKTON.


Eleanor Vane was not to go down to Berkshire alone. The beginning of
her new life, that terrible beginning which she so much dreaded, was to
make her acquainted with new people.

She had received the following communication from Mrs. Darrell:—

  “Hazlewood, April 3rd, 1855.

 “Madam,—As it would of course be very improper for a young lady of
 your age to travel alone, I have provided against that contingency.

 “My friend Mr. Monckton has kindly promised to meet you in the
 first-class waiting-room at the Great Western Station, at three
 o’clock on Monday afternoon. He will drive you here on his way home.

  “I am, Madam,
  “Yours faithfully,
  “ELLEN DARRELL.”

Eliza Picirillo worked harder upon a Monday than on any other day in
the week. She left the Pilasters immediately after an early breakfast,
to go upon a wearisome round amongst her pupils. Richard was in the
thick of the preparations for a new piece, so poor Eleanor was obliged
to go alone to the station, to meet the stranger who had been appointed
as her escort to Hazlewood.

She quite broke down when the time came for bidding farewell to her old
friend. She clung about the Signora, weeping unrestrainedly for the
first time.

“I can’t bear to go away from you,” she sobbed piteously; “I can’t bear
to say good-bye.”

“But, my love,” the music-mistress answered, tenderly, “if you don’t
really wish to go——”

“No, no, it isn’t that. I feel that I must go—that——”

“And I, too, my dear girl. I believe you would do very wrong in
refusing this situation. But, Nelly, my darling, remember that this is
only an experiment. You may not be happy at Hazlewood. In that case you
will not fail to remember that your home is always here; that, come to
it when you may, you will never fail to find a loving welcome; and that
the friends you leave behind you here are friends whom nothing upon
earth can ever estrange from you. Remember this, Eleanor.”

“Yes, yes, dear, dear Signora.”

“If I could have gone with her to the station, I shouldn’t have cared
so much,” Richard murmured, despondingly; “but the laws of Spavin and
Cromshaw are as the laws of Draco. If I don’t get on with the Swiss
châlet and moonlit Alpine peaks, the new piece can’t come out on
Monday.”

So poor Eleanor went to the station alone, and was overcharged by the
cabman who carried the two trunks which Richard had neatly addressed to
Miss Vincent, Hazlewood, Berks.

She was received by a civil porter, who took charge of her luggage
while she went to the waiting-room to look for the stranger who was to
be her escort.

She was no more a coquette than she had been nearly two years before
when she travelled alone between London and Paris, and she was prepared
to accept the services of this stranger quite as frankly as she had
accepted the care and protection of the elderly gentleman who had taken
charge of her upon that occasion.

But how was she to recognize the stranger? She could not walk up to
every gentleman in the waiting-room, to ask him if he were Mr. Monckton.

She had in almost all her wanderings travelled in second-class
carriages, and waited in second-class waiting-rooms. She shrank back,
therefore, rather timidly upon the threshold of the capacious carpeted
saloon, and looked a little nervously at the occupants of that gorgeous
chamber. There was a group of ladies near the fireplace, and there were
three gentlemen in different parts of the room. One of these gentlemen
was a little man with grey hair and a red face; the other was very
young and very sandy; the third was a tall man of about forty, with
close-cut black hair, and a square massive face and head—not exactly a
handsome face, perhaps, but a countenance not easily to be overlooked.

This tall man was standing near one of the windows, reading a
newspaper. He looked up as Eleanor pushed open the swinging door.

“I wonder which of them is Mr. Monckton,” she thought. “Not that
fidgety young man with the red hair, I hope.”

While she still stood doubtfully upon the threshold, hesitating what
to do—she little knew what a pretty picture she made in that timid,
fluttering attitude—the tall man threw down his newspaper upon the sofa
beside him, and walked across the room to where she stood.

“Miss Vincent, I believe?” he said.

Eleanor blushed at the sound of that false name, and then bent her head
in reply to the question. She could not say yes. She could not fall
into this disagreeable falsehood all at once.

“I am Mrs. Darrell’s friend and legal adviser, Mr. Monckton,” the
gentleman said, “and I shall be very happy to perform the duty she has
entrusted to me. We are in very good time, Miss Vincent. I know that
young ladies are generally _ultra_-punctual upon these occasions; and I
came very early in order to anticipate you, if possible.”

Eleanor did not speak. She was looking furtively at the face of Mrs.
Darrell’s friend and legal adviser. A good and wise adviser, Miss
Vane thought: for the face, not strictly handsome, seemed to bear in
its every feature the stamp of three qualities—goodness, wisdom, and
strength.

“I am sure he is very good,” she thought; “but I would not like to
offend him for the world, for though he looks so kind now, I know he
must be terrible when he’s angry.”

She looked almost fearfully at the strongly-marked black eyebrows,
thinking what a stormy darkness must overshadow the massive face when
they contracted over the grave, brown eyes—serious and earnest eyes,
but with a latent fire lurking somewhere in their calm depths, Eleanor
thought.

The girl’s mind rambled on thus while she stood by the stranger’s side
in the sunlit window. Already the blackness of her new life was broken
by this prominent figure standing boldly out upon its very threshold.
Already she was learning to be interested in new people.

“He isn’t a bit like a lawyer,” she thought; “I fancied lawyers were
always shabby old men, with blue bags. The men who used to come to
Chelsea after papa were always nasty disagreeable men, with papers
about the Queen and Richard Roe.”

Mr. Monckton looked thoughtfully down at the girl by his side. There
was a vein of silent poetry, and there were dim glimpses of artistic
feeling hidden somewhere in the nature of this man, very far below
the hard, business-like exterior which he presented to the world. He
felt a quiet pleasure in looking at Eleanor’s young beauty. It was
her youthfulness, perhaps, her almost childlike innocence, which made
her greatest charm. Her face was not that of a common beauty: her
aquiline nose, grey eyes, and firmly-moulded mouth had a certain air of
queenliness very rarely to be seen; but the youth of the soul shining
out of the clear eyes was visible in every glance, in every change of
expression.

“Do you know much of Berkshire, Miss Vincent?” the lawyer asked,
presently.

“Oh, no, I have never been there.”

“You are very young, and I dare say have never left home before?”
Mr. Monckton said. He was wondering that no relative or friend had
accompanied the girl to the station.

“I have been at school,” Eleanor answered; “but I have never been away
from home before—to—to get my own living.”

“I thought not. Your papa and mamma must be very sorry to lose you.”

“I have neither father nor mother.”

“Indeed!” said Mr. Monckton; “that’s strange.”

Then after a pause he said, in a low voice:

“I think the young lady you are going to will like you all the better
for that.”

“Why?” Eleanor asked involuntarily.

“Because she has never known either father or mother.”

“Poor girl!” murmured Eleanor; “they are both dead, then?”

The lawyer did not answer this question. He was so far professional,
even in his conversation with Miss Vane, that he asked a great many
more questions than he answered.

“Do you like going to Hazlewood, Miss Vincent?” he said, by-and-by,
rather abruptly.

“Not very much.”

“Why not?”

“Because I am leaving very dear friends to go to——”

“Strangers, who may ill-treat you, eh?” muttered Mr. Monckton. “You
need have no apprehension of that sort of thing, I assure you. Miss
Vincent. Mrs. Darrell is rather rigid in her ideas of life; she has
had her disappointments, poor soul, and you must be patient with her:
but Laura Mason, the young lady who is to be your companion, is the
gentlest and most affectionate girl in Christendom, I should think.
She is a sort of ward of mine, and her future life is in my hands; a
very heavy responsibility, Miss Vincent; she will have plenty of money
by-and-by—houses, and horses, and carriages, and servants, and all
the outer paraphernalia of happiness: but Heaven knows if she will be
happy, poor girl! She has never known either mother or father. She has
lived with all manner of respectable matrons, who have promised to do
a mother’s duty to her, and have tried to do it, I dare say; but she
has never had a mother, Miss Vincent. I am always sorry for her when I
think of that.”

The lawyer sighed heavily, and his thoughts seemed to wander away from
the young lady in his charge. He still stood at the window, looking out
at the bustle on the platform, but not seeing it, I think, and took no
further notice of Eleanor until the bell rang for the starting of the
train.

“Come, Miss Vincent,” he said, rousing himself suddenly from his
reverie; “I have forgotten all about your ticket. I’ll put you into a
carriage, and then send a porter for it.”

Mr. Monckton scarcely spoke to his companion half-a-dozen times during
the brief journey to Slough. He sat with a newspaper before him, but
Eleanor noticed that he never turned its leaves, and once, when she
caught a glimpse of the lawyer’s face, she saw that it wore the same
gloomy and abstracted expression that she had observed upon it as Mr.
Monckton stood in the window of the waiting-room.

“He must be very fond of his ward,” she thought, “or he could never be
so sorry because she has no mother. I thought lawyers were hard, cruel
men, who cared for nothing in the world. I always used to fancy my
sister Hortensia ought to have been a lawyer.”

By-and-by, as they drew very near to the station, Mr. Monckton dropped
his newspaper with another sigh, and turning to Eleanor, said, in a
low, confidential voice:

“I hope you will be very good to Laura Mason, Miss Vincent. Remember
that she stands quite alone in the world: and that however friendless,
however desolate you may be—I say this because you tell me you are an
orphan—you can never be so friendless or so desolate as she is.”




CHAPTER XIII.

HAZLEWOOD.


A phaeton and pair was in waiting for Mr. Monckton outside the Slough
station. The vehicle was very plain, but had a certain quiet elegance
of its own, and the horses had been sold at Tattersall’s for something
over five hundred pounds.

Eleanor Vane’s spirits rose in spite of herself as she sat by the
lawyer’s side, driving at a rapid rate through the pretty pastoral
country. They crossed the river almost immediately after leaving
Slough, and dashed into Berkshire. They skirted Windsor Park and
Forest, leaving the black outline of the castle keep behind them; and
then turned into a quiet country road, where the green banks were
dotted by clumps of early primroses, and the white-thorns were bursting
into flower.

Eleanor looked rapturously at all this rural beauty. She was a Cockney,
poor child, and her experience of the country was confined to rambles
in Greenwich Park, or on Richmond Terrace; happy rambles with her
father, prior to expensive dinners at the Crown and Sceptre, or the
Star and Garter, as the case might be.

But the country, the genuine country, the long roads and patches of
common, the glimpses of wood and water, the great deserts of arable
land, the scattered farm-houses, and noisy farm-yards; all these
were strange and new to her, and her soul expanded in the unfamiliar
atmosphere.

If that drive could have lasted for ever, it would have been very
delightful; but she knew that those splendid chestnut horses were
carrying her at a terrible rate to her new home. Her new home! What
right had she to call Hazlewood by that name? She was not going home.
She was going to her first situation.

All the pride of birth, the foolish and mistaken pride in shipwrecked
fortune and squandered wealth which this girl’s weak-minded father had
instilled into her, arose and rebelled against this bitter thought.
What humiliation Mrs. Bannister’s cruelty had inflicted upon her!

She was thinking this when Mr. Monckton suddenly turned his horses’
heads away from the main road, and the phaeton entered a lane above
which the branches of the still leafless trees made an overarching roof
of delicate tracery.

At the end of this lane, in which the primroses seemed to grow thicker
than in any other part of the country, there were some low wooden
gates, and an old-fashioned iron lamp-post. On the other side of the
gates there was a wide lawn shut in by a shrubbery and a grove of
trees, and beyond the lawn glimmered the sunlit windows of a low white
house; a rambling cottage, whose walls were half hidden by trellis-work
and ivy, and not one of whose windows or chimneys owned a fellowship
with the others.

Pigeons were cooing and hens clucking somewhere behind the house, a
horse began to neigh as the carriage stopped, and three dogs, one
very big, and two very little ones, ran out upon the lawn, and barked
furiously at the phaeton.

Eleanor Vane could not help thinking the low-roofed, white-walled,
ivy-covered irregular cottage very pretty, even though it _was_
Hazlewood.

“While the dogs were barking their loudest, a delicate little figure,
in fluttering draperies of white and blue, came floating out of a
window under the shadow of a verandah, and ran towards the gates.

It was the figure of a young lady, very fragile-looking and graceful.
A young lady whose complexion was fairer than a snow-drop, and whose
loose floating hair was of the palest shade of flaxen.

“Be quiet, Julius Cæsar; be quiet, Mark Antony,” she cried to the dogs,
who ran up to her and leaped and whirled about her, jumping almost
higher than her head in an excess of canine spirits. “Be quiet, you
big, wicked Julius Cæsar, or you shall go back to the stables, sir. Is
this the way you behave yourself when I’ve had ever so much trouble
to get you a half-holiday? Please, don’t mind them, Miss Vincent,”
the young lady added, opening the gate, and looking up pleadingly at
Eleanor; “they’re only noisy. They wouldn’t hurt you for the world; and
they’ll love you very much by-and-by, when they come to know you. I’ve
been watching for you such a time, Mr. Monckton. The train must have
been slow this afternoon!”

“The train travelled at its usual speed, neither slower nor faster,”
the lawyer said, with a quiet smile, as he handed Eleanor out of the
phaeton. He left the horses in the care of the groom, and walked on to
the lawn with the two girls. The dogs left off barking at a word from
him, though they had made very light of Miss Mason’s entreaties. They
seemed to know him, and to be accustomed to obey him.

“I know the afternoon _seemed_ dreadfully long,” the young lady said.
“I thought the train _must_ be behind its time.

“And, of course, you never thought of looking at your watch, Miss
Mason,” the lawyer said, pointing to a quantity of jewelled toys which
hung at the young lady’s blue sash.

“What’s the good of looking at one’s watch, if one’s watch won’t go?”
said Miss Mason; “the sun has been going down ever so long, but the
sun’s so changeable, there’s no relying on it. Mrs. Darrell has gone
out in the pony-carriage to call upon some people near Woodlands.”

Eleanor Vane started at the sudden mention of a name which had been so
familiar to her from her dead father’s lips.

“So I am all alone,” continued Miss Mason, “and I’m very glad of that;
because we shall get to know each other so much better by ourselves,
shan’t we, Miss Vincent?”

George Monckton had been walking between the two girls, but Laura Mason
came round to Eleanor, and put her hand in that of Miss Vane. It was
a fat little childish hand, but there were rings glittering upon it,
small as it was.

“I think I shall like you very much,” Miss Mason whispered. “Do you
think you shall like me?”

She looked up into Eleanor’s face, with an entreating expression in
her blue eyes; they were really blue eyes, a bright forget-me-not, or
turquoise blue, as different as possible from Eleanor’s clear grey
ones, which were for ever changing, sometimes purple, sometimes brown,
sometimes black.

How could Miss Vane reply to this childish question, except in the
affirmative? She had every inclination to love the babyish young lady,
who was so ready to cling to her and confide in her. She had expected
to find a haughty heiress who would have flaunted her wealth before her
penniless companion. But she had another reason for inclining tenderly
towards this girl. She remembered what Mr. Monckton had said to her in
the railway “However friendless or desolate you may be, you can never
be so friendless and desolate as she is.”

“I’m sure I shall love you, Miss Mason, if you’ll let me.”

“And you’ll not be dreadful about triplets, and arpeggios, and
syncopated passages?” the young lady said, piteously. “I don’t mind
music a bit, in a general way, you know; but I never could play
triplets in time.”

She led the way into a sitting-room under the verandah, as she talked.
Eleanor went with her, hand-in-hand, and Mr. Monckton followed, keeping
an attentive watch upon the two girls.

The sitting-room was, like the exterior of the cottage, very irregular
and very pretty. It stood at one end of the house, and there were
windows upon three sides of the room,—an oriel at the end opposite the
door, a bay opening on to the verandah, and three latticed windows with
deep oaken seats upon the other side.

The furniture was pretty, but very simple and inexpensive. The
chintz curtains and chair-covers were sprinkled with rose-buds and
butterflies; the chairs and tables were of shining maplewood; and there
was a good supply of old china arranged here and there upon brackets
and cabinets of obsolete form. The pale cream-coloured walls were hung
with a few prints and water-coloured sketches; but beyond this the
chamber had no adornments.

Laura Mason led Eleanor to one of the window-seats, where a litter of
fancy-work, and two or three open books tumbled carelessly here and
there amongst floss-silks and Berlin wools and scraps of embroidery,
gave token of the young lady’s habits.

“Will you take off your things here,” she said, “or shall I show you
your own room at once? It’s the blue room, next to mine. There’s a
door between the two rooms, so we shall be able to talk to each other
whenever we like. How dreadfully you must want something to eat after
your journey! Shall I ring for cake and wine, or shall we wait for tea?
We always drink tea at seven, and we dine very early; not like Mr.
Monckton, who has a grand late dinner every evening.”

The lawyer sighed.

“Rather a desolate dinner, sometimes, Miss Mason,” he said, gravely;
“but you remind me that I shall be hardly in time for it, and my poor
housekeeper makes herself wretched when the fish is spoiled.”

He looked at his watch.

“Six o’clock, I declare; good-bye, Laura; good-bye, Miss Vincent. I
hope you will be happy at Hazlewood.”

“I am _sure_ I shall be happy with Miss Mason,” Eleanor answered.

“Indeed!” exclaimed Mr. Monckton, elevating his straight black
eyebrows, “is she so very fascinating, then? I’m sorry for it,” he
muttered under his breath, as he walked off after shaking hands with
the two girls.

They heard the phaeton driving away three minutes afterwards.

Laura Mason shrugged her shoulders with an air of relief.

“I’m glad he’s gone,” she said.

“But you like him very much. He’s very good, isn’t he?”

“Oh, yes, very, very good, and I do like him. But I’m afraid of him,
I think, because he’s so good. He always seems to be watching one and
finding out one’s faults. And he seems so sorry because I’m frivolous,
and I can’t help being frivolous when I’m happy.”

“And are you always happy?” Eleanor asked. She thought it very possible
that this young heiress, who had never known any of those bitter
troubles which Miss Vane had found associated with “money matters,”
might indeed be _always_ happy. But Laura Mason shook her head.

“Always, except when I think,” she said; “but when I think about papa
and mamma, and wonder who they were, and why I never knew them, I can’t
help feeling very unhappy.”

“They died when you were very young, then?” Eleanor said.

Laura Mason shook her head with a sorrowful gesture.

“I scarcely know when they died,” she answered; “I know that I can
remember nothing about them; the first thing I recollect is being with
a lady, far down in Devonshire—a lady who took the charge of several
little girls. I stayed with her till I was ten years old, and then I
was sent to a fashionable school at Bayswater, and I stayed there till
I was fifteen, and then I came here, and I’ve been here two years and
a half. Mr. Monckton is my guardian, you know, and he says I am a very
lucky girl, and will have plenty of money by-and-by; but what’s the use
of money if one has no relations in all the wide world? and he tells me
to attend to my education, and not to be frivolous, or care for dress
and jewellery, but to try and become a good woman. He talks to me very
seriously, and almost frightens me sometimes with his grave manner; but
for all that, he’s very kind, and lets me have almost everything I ask
him for. He’s tremendously rich himself, you know, though he’s only a
professional man, and he lives at a beautiful place four miles from
here, called Tolldale Priory. I used to ask him questions about papa
and mamma, but he would never tell me anything. So now I never speak to
him about them.”

She sighed as she finished speaking, and was silent for some few
minutes; but she very quickly recovered her spirits, and conducted
Eleanor to a pretty rustic chamber with a lattice window looking on to
the lawn.

“Mrs. Darrell’s man is gone to fetch your luggage,” Miss Mason said,
“so you must have my brushes and combs, please, for your hair, and then
we’ll go down to tea.”

She led Eleanor into the adjoining apartment, where the dressing-table
was littered with all manner of womanly frivolities, and here Miss
Vane re-arranged her luxuriant golden-brown hair, which no longer was
allowed to fall about her shoulders in rippling curls, but was drawn
simply away from her forehead, and rolled in a knot at the back of her
head. She was a woman now, and had begun the battle of life.

A pony-carriage drove up to the gate while Eleanor was standing at the
glass by the open window, and Mrs. Darrell got out and walked across
the lawn towards the house.

She was a tall woman, unusually tall for a woman, and she was dressed
in black silk, which hung about her angular limbs in heavy, lustreless
folds. Eleanor could see that her face was pale and her eyes black and
flashing.

The two girls went down stairs hand-in-hand. Tea was prepared in the
dining-room, a long wainscoted apartment, older than the rest of the
house, and rather gloomy-looking. Three narrow windows upon one side
of this room looked towards the shrubbery and grove at the back of the
house, and the trunks of the trees looked gaunt and black in the spring
twilight. A fire was burning upon the low hearth, and a maid-servant
was lighting a lamp in the centre of the table as the two girls went in.

Mrs. Darrell welcomed her dependant very politely; but there was a
harshness and a stiffness in her politeness which reminded Eleanor of
her half-sister, Mrs. Bannister. The two women seemed to belong to the
same school, Miss Vane thought.

The lamplight shone full upon Mrs. Darrell’s face, and Eleanor could
see now that the face was a handsome one, though faded and careworn.
The widow’s hair was grey, but her eyes retained the flashing
brightness of youth. They were very dark and lustrous, but their
expression was scarcely pleasant. There was too much of the hawk or
eagle in their penetrating glance.

But Laura Mason did not seem at all afraid of her protectress.

“Miss Vincent and I are good friends already, Mrs. Darrell,” she said,
gaily, “and we shall be as happy together as the day is long, I hope.”

“And I hope Miss Vincent will teach you industrious habits, Laura,”
Miss Darrell answered, gravely.

Miss Mason made a grimace with her pretty red under-lip.

Eleanor took the seat indicated to her, a seat at the end of the
dining-table, and exactly opposite to Mrs. Darrell, who sat with her
back to the fireplace.

Sitting here, Eleanor could scarcely fail to observe an oil
painting—the only picture in the room—which hung over the mantel-piece.
It was the portrait of a young man, with dark hair clustering about a
handsome forehead, regular features, a pale complexion, and black eyes.
The face was very handsome, very aristocratic, but there was a want
of youthfulness, an absence of the fresh, eager spirit of boyhood in
its expression. A look of listless hauteur hung like a cloud over the
almost faultless features.

Mrs. Darrell watched Eleanor’s eyes as the girl looked at this picture.

“You are looking at my son, Miss Vincent,” she said; “but perhaps it
is scarcely necessary to tell you so. People say there is a strong
likeness between us.”

There was indeed a very striking resemblance between the faded face
below and the pictured face above. But it seemed to Eleanor Vane as if
the mother’s face, faded and careworn though it was, was almost the
younger of the two. The listless indifference, the utter lack of energy
in the lad’s countenance, was so much the more striking when contrasted
with the youthfulness of the features.

“Yes,” exclaimed Laura Mason, “that is Mrs. Darrell’s only son,
Launcelot Darrell. Isn’t that a romantic name, Miss Vincent?”

Eleanor started. This Launcelot Darrell was the young man she had heard
her father speak of; the man who expected to inherit the De Crespigny
estate. How often she had heard his name! It was he, then, who would
have stood between her father and fortune, had that dear father lived;
or whose claim of kindred would, perhaps, have had to make way for the
more sacred right of friendship.

And this young man’s portrait was hanging in the room where she sat.
He lived in the house, perhaps. Where should he live except in his
mother’s house?

But Eleanor’s mind was soon relieved upon this point, for Laura Mason,
in the pauses of the business of the tea-table, talked a good deal
about the original of the portrait.

“Don’t you think him handsome, Miss Vincent?” she asked, without
waiting for an answer. “But of course you do; everybody thinks him
handsome; and then Mrs. Darrell says he’s so elegant, so tall, so
aristocratic. He is almost sure to have Woodlands by-and-by, and all
Mr. de Crespigny’s money. But of course you don’t know Woodlands
or Mr. de Crespigny. How should you, when you’ve never been in
Berkshire before? And he—not Mr. de Crespigny, he’s a nasty, fidgety,
hypochon—what’s its name?—old man—but Launcelot Darrell is _so_
accomplished. He’s an artist, you know, and all the water-coloured
sketches in the drawing-room and the breakfast-parlour are his; and
he plays and sings, and he dances exquisitely, and he rides and plays
cricket, and he’s a—what you may call it—a crack shot; and, in short,
he’s an Admirable Crichton. You mustn’t fancy I’m in love with him,
you know, Miss Vincent,” the young lady added, blushing and laughing,
“because I never saw him in my life, and I only know all this by
hearsay.”

“You never saw him!” repeated Eleanor.

Launcelot Darrell did not live at Hazlewood, then.

“No,” the widow interposed; “my son has enemies, I am sorry to say,
amongst his own kindred. Instead of occupying the position his talents,
to say nothing of his birth, entitle him to, he has been compelled to
go out to India in a mercantile capacity. I do not wonder that his
spirit rebels against such an injustice. I do not wonder that he cannot
forgive.”

Mrs. Darrell’s face darkened as she spoke, and she sighed heavily.
By-and-by, when the two girls were alone together in the breakfast
room, Laura Mason alluded to the conversation at the tea-table.

“I don’t think I ought to have talked about Launcelot Darrell,” she
said; “I know his mother is unhappy about him, though I don’t exactly
know why. You see his two aunts, who live at Woodlands, are nasty,
scheming old maids, and they contrived to keep him away from his great
uncle, Mr. de Crespigny, who is expected to leave him all his money.
Indeed, I don’t see who else he can leave it to now. There was an old
man—a college friend of Mr. de Crespigny’s—who expected to get the
Woodlands estate; but of course that was an absurd idea; and the old
man—the father of that very Mrs. Bannister who recommended you to Mrs.
Darrell, by the bye—is dead. So all chance of that sort of thing is
over.

“And Mr. Launcelot Darrell is sure to have the fortune?” Eleanor said,
interrogatively, after a very long pause.

“Well, I don’t know about that: but I’ve heard Mrs. Darrell say that
Launcelot was a great favourite of Mr. de Crespigny’s when he was a
boy. But those two cantankerous old maids, Mrs. Darrell’s sisters, are
nagging at the old man night and day, and they may persuade him at
last, or they may have succeeded in persuading him, perhaps, ever so
long ago, to make a will in their favour. Of course all this makes Mrs.
Darrell very unhappy. She idolizes her son, who is an only child, and
was terribly spoiled when he was a boy, they say; and she does not know
whether he will be a rich man or a pauper.”

“And in the meantime, Mr. Darrell is in India?”

“Yes. He went to India three years ago. He’s overseer to an
indigo-planter up the country, at some place with an unpronounceable
name, hundreds and hundreds of miles from Calcutta. He’s not at all
happy, I believe, and he very seldom writes—not above once in a
twelvemonth.”

“He is not a good son, then,” Eleanor said.

“Oh, I don’t know about that! Mrs. Darrell never complains, and she’s
very proud of him. She always speaks of him as ‘my son.’ But, of
course, what with one thing and another, she is often very unhappy. So,
if she is a little severe, now and then, we’ll try and bear with her,
won’t we, Eleanor? I may call you Eleanor, mayn’t I?”

The pretty flaxen head dropped upon Miss Vane’s shoulder, as the
heiress asked this question, and the blue eyes were lifted pleadingly.

“Yes, yes; I would much rather be called Eleanor than Miss Vincent.”

“And you’ll call me Laura. Nobody ever calls me Miss Mason except Mr.
Monckton when he lectures me. We shall be very, very happy together, I
hope, Eleanor.”

“I hope so, dear.”

There was a sudden pang of mingled fear and remorse at Eleanor Vane’s
heart as she said this. Was she to be happy, and to forget the purpose
of her life? Was she to be happy, and false to the memory of her
murdered father? In this quiet country life; in this pleasant girlish
companionship which was so new to her; was she to abandon that one dark
dream, that one deeply-rooted desire which had been in her mind ever
since her father’s untimely death?

She recoiled with a shudder of dread from the simple happiness which
threatened to lull her to a Sybarite rest; in which that deadly design
might lose its force, and, little by little, fade out of her mind.

She disengaged herself from the slight arms which had encircled her in
a half-childish caress, and rose suddenly to her feet.

“Laura,” she cried, “Laura, you mustn’t talk to me like this. My life
is not like yours. I have something to do,—I have a purpose to achieve;
a purpose before which every thought of my mind, every impulse of my
heart, must give way.”

“What purpose, Eleanor?” asked Laura Mason, almost alarmed by the
energy of her companion’s manner.

“I cannot tell you. It is a secret,” Miss Vane replied.

Then sitting down once more in the deep window-seat by Laura’s side,
Eleanor Vane drew her arm tenderly round the frightened girl’s waist.

“I’ll try and do my duty to you, Laura, dear,” she said, “and I know I
shall be happy with you. But if ever you see me dull and silent, you’ll
understand, dear, that there is a secret in my life, and that there
is a hidden purpose in my mind that sooner or later must be achieved.
Sooner or later,” she repeated, with a sigh, “but Heaven only knows
when.”

She was silent and absent-minded during the rest of the evening, though
she played one of her most elaborate fantasias at Mrs. Darrell’s
request, and perfectly satisfied that lady’s expectations by the
brilliancy of her touch. She was very glad when, at ten o’clock, the
two women servants of the simple household and a hobbledehoyish young
man, who looked after the pony and pigs and poultry-yard, and smelt
very strongly of the stable, came in to hear prayers read by Mrs.
Darrell.

“I know you’re tired, dear,” Laura Mason said, as she bade Eleanor good
night at the door of her bedroom, “so I won’t ask you to talk to me
to-night. Get to bed, and go to sleep at once, dear.”

But Eleanor did not go to bed immediately; nor did she fall asleep
until very late that night.

She unfastened one of her trunks, and took from it a little locked
morocco casket, which held a few valueless and old-fashioned trinkets
that had been her mother’s, and the crumpled fragment of her father’s
last letter.

She sat at the little dressing-table, reading the disjointed sentences
in that melancholy letter, before she undressed, and then replaced the
scrap of paper in the casket.

She looked at the lawn and shrubbery. The shining leaves of the
evergreens trembled in the soft April breeze, and shimmered in the
moonlight. All was silent in that simple rustic retreat. The bare
branches of the tall trees near the low white gates were sharply
defined against the sky. High up in the tranquil heavens the full moon
shone out from a pale background of fleecy cloud.

The beauty of the scene made a very powerful impression upon Eleanor
Vane. The window from which she had been accustomed to look in
Bloomsbury abutted on a yard, a narrow gorge of dirt and disorder,
between the dismal back walls of high London houses.

“I ought never to have come here,” Eleanor thought, bitterly, as she
let fall her dimity window curtain and shut out the splendour of the
night. “I ought to have stayed in London; there was some hope of my
meeting that man in London, where strange things are always happening.
But here——”

She fell into a gloomy reverie. Secluded in that quiet rustic retreat,
what hope could she have of advancing, by so much as one footstep, upon
the dark road she had appointed for herself to tread?

It was very long before she fell asleep. She lay for hours, tumbling
and tossing feverishly upon her comfortable bed.

The memories of her old life mingled themselves with thoughts of her
new existence. She was haunted now by the recollection of her father
and her father’s death; now by her fresh experiences of Hazlewood, by
the widow’s grey hair and penetrating gaze, and by the pictured face of
Launcelot Darrell.




CHAPTER XIV.

THE PRODIGAL’S RETURN.


The course of Eleanor’s life at Hazlewood was peaceful and monotonous.
She had been engaged simply as a “companion” for Laura Mason. That
common epithet, which is so often twisted into the signification of
a household drudge—an upperservant, who works harder than any of her
fellows—in this case meant purely and simply what it was originally
intended to mean. Eleanor’s only duties were to teach Laura Mason
music, and to be the companion and associate of all her girlish
pleasures and industries.

Not that Miss Mason was very industrious. She had a habit of beginning
great undertakings in the way of fancy work, and the more gigantic the
design the more ardent was her desire to attempt it—but she rarely
got beyond the initiative part of her labour. There was always some
“Dweller on the Threshold” in the shape of a stitch that couldn’t be
learnt, or a skein of silk that couldn’t be matched, or a pattern
that _wouldn’t_ come right; and one after another of the gigantic
undertakings was flung aside to decay in dusty oblivion, or to be
finished by Eleanor or Mrs. Darrell.

Laura Mason was not made for the active service of life. She was one
of the holiday soldiers in the great army, fit for nothing but to wear
gilded epaulettes and gorgeous uniforms, and to turn out upon gala days
to the sound of trumpet and drum.

She was a loving, generous-hearted, confiding creature; but, like some
rudderless boat drifting hither and thither before a stormy ocean, this
frivolous, purposeless girl flung herself, helpless and dependent, upon
the mercy of other people.

The rich City solicitor, Mr. Monckton, the head of a celebrated legal
firm familiar in the Bankruptcy Court, took the trouble to say very
little about his pretty, flaxen-haired, and blue-eyed ward.

He spoke of her, indeed, with an almost pointed indifference. She was
the daughter of some people he had known in his early youth, he said,
and her fortune had been entrusted to his care. She would be rich,
but he was none the less anxious about her future. A woman was not
generally any the safer in this world for being an heiress. This was
all Gilbert Monckton had ever said to Mrs. Darrell upon the subject of
his ward’s past history. Laura herself had talked freely enough of her
first two homes. There was little to tell, but, upon the other hand,
there seemed nothing to conceal.

Upon one subject Mr. Monckton was very strict, and that was the
seclusion of the home he had chosen for his ward.

“When Miss Mason is of age she will of course choose for herself,” he
said; “but until that time comes, I must beg, Mrs. Darrell, that you
will keep her out of all society.”

Under these circumstances it was especially necessary that Laura Mason
should have a companion of her own age. Hazlewood was a hermitage,
never approached by any visitors except some half-dozen elderly ladies,
who were intimate with Mrs. Darrell, and Mr. Monckton, who came about
once a fortnight to dine and spend the evening.

He used to devote himself very much to Laura and her companion
during these visits. Eleanor could see how earnestly he watched the
flaxen-haired girl, whose childish simplicity no doubt made her very
bewitching to the grave man of business. He watched her and listened
to her; sometimes with a pleased smile, sometimes with an anxious
expression on his face; but his attention vary rarely wandered from
her.

“He must love her very dearly,” Eleanor thought, remembering how
earnestly he had spoken in the railway carriage.

She wondered what was the nature of the affection which the solicitor
felt for his ward. He was old enough to be her father, it was true, but
he was still in the prime of life; he had not that beauty of feature
and complexion which a school-girl calls handsome, but he had a face
which leaves its impress upon the minds of those who look at it.

He was very clever, or at least he seemed so to Eleanor; for there
was no subject ever mentioned, no topic ever discussed, with which he
did not appear thoroughly familiar, and upon which his opinions were
not original and forcible. Eleanor’s intellect expanded under the
influence of this superior masculine intelligence. Her plastic mind,
so ready to take any impression, was newly moulded by its contact with
this stronger brain. Her education, very imperfect before, seemed to
complete itself now by this occasional association with a clever man.

Of course all this came about by slow degrees. She did not very rapidly
become familiar with Gilbert Monckton, for his grave manner was rather
calculated to inspire diffidence in a very young woman; but little
by little, as she grew accustomed to his society, accustomed to sit
quietly in the shade, only speaking now and then, while Laura Mason
talked familiarly to her guardian, she began to discover how much she
had gained from her association with the lawyer. It was not without
some bitterness of spirit that Eleanor Vane thought of this. She felt
as if she had been an interloper in that quiet Hazlewood household.
What right had she to come between Laura and her guardian, and steal
the advantages Mr. Monckton intended for his ward? It was for Laura’s
sake he had been earnest or eloquent; it was for Laura’s benefit he had
described this, or explained that. What right, then, had she, Eleanor,
to remember what Laura had forgotten, or to avail herself of the
advantages Laura was too frivolous to value?

There was a gulf between the two girls that could not be passed, even
by affection. Eleanor Vane’s mental superiority placed her so high
above Laura Mason that perfect confidence could not exist between them.
Eleanor’s love for the light-hearted, heedless girl, had something
almost motherly in its nature.

“I know we shall never quite understand each other, Laura,” she said;
“but I think I could give up my life for your sake, my dear.”

“Or I for you, Nelly.”

“No, no, Laura. I know you are unselfish as an angel, and you’d wish
to do so; but yours is not the giving-up nature, my darling. You’d die
under a great sorrow.”

“I think I should, Nelly,” the girl answered, drawing closer to her
friend, and trembling at the very thought of calamity; “but how you
speak, dear. Had you ever a great sorrow?”

“Yes, a very great one.”

“And yet you are happy with us, and can sing and play, and ramble about
in the woods with me, Nell, as if you had nothing on your mind.”

“Yes, Laura, but I can remember my sorrow all the time. It is hidden so
deep in my heart that the sunshine never reaches it, however happy I
may seem.”

Laura Mason sighed. The spoiled child of fortune could not help
wondering how she would act under the influence of a great misery. She
would sit down upon the ground in some darkened room, she thought, and
cry until her heart broke and she died.

The summer faded into autumn, and autumn into winter, and the early
spring flowers bloomed again in the shrubberies and on the lawn at
Hazlewood. The primroses were pale upon the tender grass of the sloping
banks in the broad lane near the gates, and still no event had happened
to break the tranquil monotony of that secluded household. Eleanor had
grown familiar with every nook in the rambling old cottage; even with
Launcelot Darrell’s apartments, a suite of rooms on the bedroom floor,
looking out into the grove at the back of the house. Those rooms had
been shut up for years, ever since Launcelot had sailed for India,
and they had a desolate look, though fires had been lighted in them
periodically, and every scrap of furniture was kept carefully dusted.

“The rooms must always be ready,” Mrs. Darrell said. “Mr. de Crespigny
may die, and my son may be called home suddenly.”

So the three rooms, a bedroom, dressing-room, and sitting-room, were
kept in perfect order, and Laura and Eleanor wandered into them
sometimes, in the idleness of a wet afternoon, and looked at the
pictures upon the walls, the unfinished sketches piled one upon the top
of another on the easel, or tried the little cottage piano, upon which
Mr. Darrell had been wont to accompany himself when he sang. His mother
always insisted upon this piano being tuned when the tuner came from
Windsor to attend to Laura Mason’s modern grand. The two girls used to
talk a good deal of the widow’s handsome son. They had heard him spoken
of by his mother, by the servants, and by the few humble neighbours
in scattered cottages near Hazlewood. They talked of his uncertain
fortunes, his accomplishments, his handsome, haughty face, which Laura
declared was faultless.

Miss Vane had by this time been a twelvemonth at Hazlewood. Her
eighteenth birthday was past, and the girlishness of her appearance
had matured into the serene beauty of early womanhood. The golden
tints of her hair had deepened into rich auburn, her grey eyes looked
darker under the shadow of her dark brows. When she went to spend a
brief Christmas holiday with her old friends, the Signora and Richard
Thornton declared that she had altered very much since she had left
them, and were surprised at her matured beauty. She bought the silk
gown for Eliza Picirillo, and the meerschaum pipe for poor Dick, who
needed no memorial of his adopted sister; for her image haunted him
only too perpetually, to the destruction of all other images which
might else have found a place in the scene-painter’s heart.

Eleanor Vane felt a pang of remorse as she remembered how very easily
she had borne her separation from these faithful friends. It was not
that she loved them less, or forgot their goodness to her. She had no
such ingratitude as that wherewith to reproach herself; but she felt
as if she had committed a sin against them in being happy in the calm
serenity of Hazlewood.

She said this to Richard Thornton during the brief Christmas visit.
They had walked out once more in the quiet streets and squares in the
early winter twilight.

“I feel as if I had grown selfish and indifferent,” she said. “The
months pass one after another. It is two years and a half since my
father died, and I am not one step nearer to the discovery of the man
who caused his death. Not one step. I am buried alive at Hazlewood. I
am bound hand and foot. What can I do, Richard; what can I do? I could
go mad, almost, when I remember that I am a poor helpless girl, and
that I may never be able to keep the oath I swore when I first read my
dead father’s letter. And you, Richard, in all this time you have done
nothing to help me.”

The scene-painter shook his head sadly enough.

“What can I do, my dear Eleanor? What I told you nearly a year ago, I
tell you again now. This man will never be found. What hope have we?
what chance of finding him? We might hear his name to-morrow, and we
should not know it. If either of us met him in the street, we should
pass him by. We might live in the same house with him, and be ignorant
of his presence.”

“No, Richard,” cried Eleanor Vane. “I think if I met that man some
instinct of hate and horror would reveal his identity to me.”

“My poor romantic Nelly, you talk as if life was a melodrama. No, my
dear, I say again, this man will never be found; the story of your
father’s death is unhappily a common one. Let that sad story rest,
Nell, with all the other mournful records of the past. Believe me that
you cannot do better than be happy at Hazlewood; happy in your innocent
life, and utterly forgetful of the foolish vow you made when you were
little better than a child. If all the improbabilities that you have
ever dreamt of were to come to pass, and vengeance were in your grasp,
I hope and believe, Nell, that a better spirit would arise within you,
and prompt you to let it go.”

Richard Thornton spoke very seriously. He had never been able to
speak of Eleanor’s scheme of retribution without grief and regret.
He recognized the taint of her father’s influence in this vision
of vengeance and destruction. All George Vane’s notions of justice
and honour had been rather the meretricious and flimsy ideas of a
stage play, than the common-sense views of real life. He had talked
incessantly to his daughter about days of retribution; gigantic
vengeances which were looming somewhere in the far-away distance,
for the ultimate annihilation of the old man’s enemies. This foolish
ruined spendthrift, who cried out against the world because his money
was spent, and his place in that world usurped by wiser men, had been
Eleanor’s teacher during her most impressionable years. It was scarcely
to be wondered at, then, that there were some flaws in the character of
this motherless girl, and that she was ready to mistake a pagan scheme
of retribution for the Christian duty of filial love.

Midsummer had come and gone, when an event occurred to break the
tranquillity of that simple household.

The two girls had lingered late in the garden one evening early in
July. Mrs. Darrell sat writing in the breakfast-parlour. The lamplight
glimmered under the shadow of the verandah, and the widow’s tall figure
seated at her desk was visible through the open bay window.

Laura and her companion had been talking for a long time, but Eleanor
had lapsed into silence at last, and stood against the low white gate
with her elbow resting upon the upper bar, looking thoughtfully out
into the lane. Miss Mason was never the first to be tired of talking.
A silvery torrent of innocent babble was for ever gushing from her red
babyish lips; so, when at last Eleanor grew silent and absent-minded,
the heiress was fain to talk to her dogs; her darling silky Skye, whose
great brown eyes looked out from a ball of floss silk that represented
the animal’s head; and her Italian greyhound, a slim shivering brute,
who wore a coloured flannel paletot, and exhibited a fretful and
whimpering disposition, far from agreeable to any one but his mistress.

There was no moon upon this balmy July night, and the hulking
hobbledehoy-of-all-work came out to light the lamp while the two girls
were standing at the gate. This lamp gave a pleasant aspect to the
cottage upon dark nights, and threw a bright line of light into the
obscurity of the lane.

The boy had scarcely retired with his short ladder and flaming
lantern, when the two pet dogs began to bark violently, and a man came
out of the darkness into the line of lamplight.

Laura Mason gave a startled scream; but Eleanor caught her by the arm,
to check her foolish outcry.

There was nothing very alarming in the aspect of the man. He was only a
tramp: not a common beggar, but a shabby-genteel-looking tramp, whose
threadbare coat was of a fashionable make, and who, in spite of his
ragged slovenliness, had something the look of a gentleman.

“Mrs. Darrell still lives here, does she not?” he asked, rather eagerly.

“Yes.”

It was Eleanor who answered. The dogs were still barking, and Laura was
still looking very suspiciously at the stranger.

“Will you tell her, please, that she is wanted out here by some one who
has something important to communicate to her,” the man said.

Eleanor was going towards the house to deliver this message, when she
saw Mrs. Darrell coming across the lawn. She had been disturbed at her
writing by the barking of the dogs.

“What is the matter, Miss Vincent?” she asked, sharply. “Who are you
and Laura talking to, out here?”

She walked from the two girls to the man, who stood back a little way
outside the gate, with the lamplight shining full upon his face.

The widow looked sternly at this man who had dared to come to the gate
at nightfall, and to address the two girls under her charge.

But her face changed as she looked at him, and a wild cry broke from
her lips.

“Launcelot, Launcelot, my son!”




CHAPTER XV.

LAUNCELOT.


Mrs. Darrell stood for some time clasped in her son’s embrace, and
sobbing violently. The two girls withdrew a few paces, too bewildered
to know what to do, in the first shock of the surprise that had come so
suddenly upon them.

This was Launcelot Darrell, then, the long absent son, whose portrait
hung above the mantel-piece in the dining-room, whose memory was
so tenderly cherished, every token of whose former presence was so
carefully preserved.

“My boy, my boy,” murmured the widow, in a voice which seemed strange
to the two girls, from its new accent of tenderness; “my own and only
son, how is it that you come back to me thus? I thought you were in
India. I thought——”

“I was in India, mother, when my last letter to you was written,” the
young man answered; “but you know how sick and tired I was of the
odious climate, and the odious life I was compelled to lead. It grew
unbearable at last, and I determined to throw everything up, and come
home; so I sailed in the first vessel that left Calcutta after I had
formed this determination. You’re not sorry to see me back, are you,
mother?”

“Sorry to see you, Launcelot!”

Mrs. Darrell led her son across the lawn and into the house, through
an open window. She seemed utterly unconscious of the presence of her
two charges. She seemed to have forgotten their very existence in the
wonderful surprise of her son’s return. So Laura and Eleanor went up
to Miss Mason’s room and shut themselves in to talk over the strange
adventures of the evening, while the mother and son were closeted
together in the breakfast-room below.

“Isn’t it all romantic, Nelly, dear?” Miss Mason said, with enthusiasm.
“I wonder whether he came all the way from India in that dreadful coat
and that horrid shabby hat? He looks just like the hero of a novel,
doesn’t he, Nell? dark and pale, and tall and slender. Has he come back
for good, do you think? I’m sure he ought to have Mr. de Crespigny’s
fortune.”

Miss Vane shrugged her shoulders. She was not particularly
interested in the handsome prodigal son who had made his appearance
so unexpectedly: and she had enough to do to listen to all Laura’s
exclamations, and sympathize with her curiosity.

“I shan’t sleep a bit to-night, Nelly,” Miss Mason said as she parted
from her friend. “I shall be dreaming of Launcelot Darrell, with his
dark eyes and pale face. What a fierce, half-angry look he has, Nell,
as if he were savage with the world for having treated him badly. For
he must have been badly treated, you know. We know how clever he is.
He ought to have been made a governor-general, or an ambassador, or
something of that kind, in India. He has no right to be shabby.”

“I should think his shabbiness was his own fault, Laura,” Miss Vane
answered, quietly. “If he is clever, you know, he ought to be able to
earn money.”

She thought of Richard Thornton as she spoke, working at the Phœnix
Theatre for the poor salary that helped to support the Bohemian
comforts of that primitive shelter in the Pilasters; and Dick’s paint
and whitewash bespattered coat seemed glorified by contrast with that
of the young prodigal in the room below.

The two girls went down to the breakfast-room early the next morning,
Laura Mason arrayed in her prettiest and brightest muslin morning
dress, which was scarcely so bright as her beaming face. The young
lady’s gossamer white robes fluttered with the floating ribbons and
delicate laces that adorned them. She was a coquette by nature, and
was eager to take her revenge for all the monotonous days of enforced
seclusion which she had endured.

Mrs. Darrell was sitting at the breakfast-table when the two girls
entered the room. Her Bible lay open amongst the cups and saucers near
her. Her face was pale. She looked even more careworn than usual; and
her eyes were dimmed by the tears that she had shed. The heroism of the
woman who had borne her son’s absence silently and uncomplainingly, had
given way under the unlooked-for joy of his return.

She gave her hand to each of the girls as they wished her good morning.
Eleanor almost shuddered as she felt the deadly coldness of that wasted
hand.

“We will begin breakfast at once, my dears,” Mrs. Darrell said,
quietly; “my son is fatigued by a long journey, and exhausted by the
excitement of his return. He will not get up, therefore, until late in
the day.”

The widow poured out the tea, and for some little time there was
silence at the breakfast-table. Neither Eleanor nor Laura liked to
speak. They both waited—one patiently, the other very impatiently,
until Mrs. Darrell should please to tell them something about her son’s
extraordinary return.

It seemed as if the mistress of Hazlewood, usually so coldly dignified
and self-possessed, felt some little embarrassment in speaking of the
strange scene of the previous night.

“I need scarcely tell you, Laura,” she said, rather abruptly, after
a very long pause, “that if anything could lessen my happiness in my
son’s return, it would be the manner of his coming back to his old
home. He comes back to me poorer than when he went away. He came on
foot from Southampton here; he came looking like a tramp and a beggar
to his mother’s house. But it would be hard if I blamed my poor boy for
this. The sin lies at his uncle’s door. Maurice de Crespigny should
have known that Colonel Darrell’s only son would never stoop to a life
of commercial drudgery. Launcelot’s letters might have prepared me for
what has happened. Their brevity, their bitter, despondent tone, might
have told the utter hopelessness of a commercial career for my son. He
tells me that he left India because his position there—a position which
held out no promise of improvement—had become unbearable. He comes back
to me penniless, with the battle of life before him. You can scarcely
wonder, then, that my happiness in his return is not unalloyed.”

“No, indeed, dear Mrs. Darrell,” Laura answered, eagerly; “but still
you must be very glad to have him back: and if he didn’t make a
fortune in India, he can make one in England, I dare say. He is so
handsome, and so clever, and——”

The young lady stopped suddenly, blushing under the cold scrutiny
of Ellen Darrell’s eyes. Perhaps in that moment a thought flashed
across the mind of the widow—the thought of a wealthy marriage for her
handsome son. She knew that Laura Mason was rich, for Mr. Monckton had
told her that his ward would have all the advantages in after life
which wealth can bestow; but she had no idea of the amount of the
girl’s fortune.

Launcelot Darrell slept late after his pedestrian journey. Miss Mason’s
piano was kept shut, out of consideration for the traveller; and Laura
and Eleanor found the bright summer’s morning unusually long. They had
so few pursuits, or amusements, that to be deprived of one seemed very
cruel. They were in a shady nook in the shrubbery, after their early
dinner, Laura lying on the ground, reading a novel, and Eleanor engaged
in some needlework achievement, which was by-and-by to be presented
to the Signora; when the rustling leaves of the laurel screen that
enclosed and sheltered their retreat were parted, and the handsome
face, the face which had looked worn and haggard last night, but which
now had only an aristocratic air of languor, presented itself before
them in a frame of dark foliage.

“Good morning, or good afternoon, young ladies,” said Mr. Darrell,
“for I hear that your habits at Hazlewood are very primitive, and that
you dine at three o’clock. I have been looking for you during the
last half-hour, in my anxiety to apologize for any alarm I may have
given you last night. When the landless heir returns to his home, he
scarcely expects to find two angels waiting for him on the threshold. I
might have been a little more careful of my toilet, had I been able to
foresee my reception. What luggage I had I left at Southampton.”

“Oh! never mind your dress, Mr. Darrell,” Laura answered, gaily, “we
are both so glad you have come home. Ain’t we, Eleanor? for our lives
are so dreadfully dull here, though your mamma is very kind to us. But
do tell us all about your voyage home, and your journey here on foot,
and all the troubles you have gone through? Do tell us your adventures,
Mr. Darrell?”

The young lady lifted her bright blue eyes with a languishing glance of
pity; but suddenly dropped them under the young man’s gaze. He looked
from one to the other of the two girls, and then, strolling into the
grassy little amphitheatre where they were sitting, flung himself into
a rustic arm-chair, near the table at which Eleanor Vane sat at work.

Launcelot Darrell was a handsome likeness of his mother. The features,
which in her face were stern and hard, had in his an almost feminine
softness. The dark eyes had a lazy light in them, and were half hidden
by the listless droop of the black lashes that fringed their full
white lids. The straight nose, low forehead, and delicately moulded
mouth, were almost classical in their physical perfection; but there
was a something wanting in the lower part of the face; the chin receded
a little where it should have projected, the handsome mouth was weak
and undecided in expression.

Mr. Darrell might have sat as a painter’s model for all the lovers in
prose or poetry; but he would never have been mistaken for a hero or a
statesman. He had all the attributes of grace and beauty, but not one
of the outward signs of greatness. Eleanor Vane felt this want of power
in the young man as she looked at him. Her rapid perception seized upon
the one defect which marred so much perfection.

“If I had need of help against the murderer of my father,” the girl
thought, “I would not ask this man to aid me.”

“And now, Mr. Darrell,” said Laura, throwing down her book, and
settling herself for a flirtation with the prodigal son, “tell us all
your adventures. We are dying to hear them.”

Launcelot Darrell shrugged his shoulders.

“What adventures, my dear Miss Mason?”

“Why, your Indian experiences, of course, and your journey home.
All your romantic escapes, and thrilling perils, tiger-hunting,
pig-sticking—that doesn’t sound romantic, but I suppose it is—lonely
nights in which you lost yourself in the jungle, horrible encounters
with rattlesnakes, brilliant balls at the Government House—you see I
know all about Indian life—rides on the race-course, flirtations with
Calcutta belles.”

The young man laughed at Miss Mason’s enthusiasm.

“You know more about the delights of an Indian existence than I do,”
he said, rather bitterly; “a poor devil who goes out to Calcutta with
only one letter of introduction, and an empty purse, and is sent up the
country, within a few days of his arrival, to a lonely station, where
his own face is about the only white one in the neighbourhood, hasn’t
very much chance of becoming familiar with Government House festivities
or Calcutta belles, who reserve their smiles for the favoured children
of fortune, I can assure you. As to tiger-hunts and pig-sticking, my
dear Miss Mason, I can give you very little information upon those
points, for an indigo planter’s overseer, whose nose is kept pretty
close to the grindstone, has enough to do for his pitiful stipend, and
very little chance of becoming a Gordon Cumming or a Jules Gerard.”

Laura Mason looked very much disappointed.

“You didn’t like India, then, Mr. Darrell?” she said.

“I hated it,” the young man answered, between his set teeth.

There was so much suppressed force in Launcelot Darrell’s utterance of
these three words, that Eleanor looked up from her work, startled by
the young man’s sudden vehemence.

He was looking straight before him, his dark eyes fixed, his strongly
marked eyebrows contracted, and a red spot burning in the centre of
each pale and rather hollow cheek.

“But why did you hate India?” Laura asked, with unflinching pertinacity.

“Why does a man hate poverty and humiliation, Miss Mason? You might
as well ask me that. Suppose we drop the subject. It isn’t a very
agreeable one to me, I assure you.”

“But your voyage home,” pursued Laura, quite unabashed by this rebuff;
“you can tell us your adventures during the voyage home?”

“I had no adventures. Men who travel by the overland route may have
something to tell, perhaps: I came the cheapest and the slowest way.”

“By a sailing vessel?”

“Yes.”

“And what was the name of the vessel?”

“_The Indus._”

“_The Indus_, that’s an easy name to remember. But of course you had
all sorts of amusements on board: you played whist in the cuddy—what
is the cuddy, by the bye?—and you got up private theatricals, and you
started an amateur newspaper, or a magazine, and you crossed the line,
and——”

“Oh, yes, we went through the usual routine. It was dreary enough.
Pray tell me something about Hazlewood, Miss Mason; I am a great deal
more interested in Berkshire than you can possibly be in my Indian
experiences.”

The young lady was fain to submit. She told Mr. Darrell such scraps
and shreds of gossip as form the “news” in a place like Hazlewood. He
listened very attentively to anything Miss Mason had to tell about his
uncle, Maurice de Crespigny.

“So those tiger cats, my maiden aunts, are as watchful as ever,”
he said, when Laura had finished. “Heaven grant the harpies may be
disappointed! Do any of the Vane family ever try to get at the old man?”

Eleanor looked up from her work, but very quietly; she had grown
accustomed to hear her name spoken by those who had no suspicion of her
identity.

“Oh, no, I believe not,” Miss Mason answered: “old Mr. Vane died two or
three years ago, you know.”

“Yes, my mother wrote me word of his death.”

“You were in India when it happened, then?”

“Yes.”

Eleanor’s face blanched, and her heart beat with a fierce heavy
throbbing against her breast. How dared they talk of her dead father
in that tone of almost insolent indifference? The one passion of her
young life had as strong a power over her now as when she had knelt in
the little chamber in the Rue de l’Archevêque, with her clasped hands
uplifted to the low ceiling, and a terrible oath upon her girlish lips.

She dropped her work suddenly, and rising from her rustic seat, walked
away from the shade of the laurels.

“Eleanor,” cried Laura Mason, “where are you going?”

Launcelot Darrell sat in a lounging attitude, trifling with the reels
of silk, and balls of wool, and all the paraphernalia of fancy work
scattered upon the table before him, but he lifted his head as Laura
uttered her friend’s name, and perhaps for the first time looked
steadily at Miss Vane.

He sat looking at her for some minutes while she and Laura stood
talking together a few paces from him. It was perhaps only a painter’s
habit of looking earnestly at a pretty face that gave intensity to his
gaze. He dropped his eyelids presently, and drew a long breath, that
sounded almost like a sign of relief.

“An accidental likeness,” he muttered; “there are a hundred such
likenesses in the world.”

He got up and walked back to the house, leaving the two girls together.
Laura had a great deal to say about his handsome face, and the easy
grace of his manner; but Eleanor Vane was absent and thoughtful. The
mention of her father’s name had brought back the past. Her peaceful
life, and all its quiet contentment, melted away like a curtain
of morning mist that rises to disclose the ghastly horror of a
battle-field; and the dreadful picture of the past arose before her;
painfully vivid, horribly real. The parting on the boulevard; the long
night of agony and suspense; the meeting with Richard on the bridge by
the Morgue; her father’s torn, disjointed letter; and her own vengeful
wrath; all returned to her. Every voice of her heart seemed to call her
away from the commonplace tranquillity of her life to some desperate
act of justice and retribution.

“What have I to do with this frivolous girl?” she thought; “what is it
to me whether Launcelot Darrell’s nose is Grecian or aquiline, whether
his eyes are black or brown? What a wretched, useless life I am leading
in this place, when I should be hunting through the world for the
murderer of my father.”

She sighed wearily as she remembered how powerless she was. What
could she do to get one step nearer to the accomplishment of that
single purpose, which she called the purpose of her life? Nothing! She
remembered with a chill feeling of despair that however, in her moments
of exaltation, she might look forward to some shadowy day of triumph
and revenge, her better sense always told her that Richard Thornton had
spoken the truth. The man whose treachery had destroyed George Vane
had dropped into the chaos of on over-crowded universe, leaving no
clue behind him by which he might be traced.




CHAPTER XVI.

THE LAWYER’S SUSPICION.


Mr. Monckton came to Hazlewood upon the day after Launcelot Darrell’s
arrival. The grave solicitor had known the young man before his
departure for India, but there seemed no very great intimacy between
them, and Mr. Darrell appeared rather to avoid any familiarity with his
mother’s rich friend.

He answered Gilbert Monckton’s questions about India and
indigo-planting with an air of unwillingness that was almost insolent.

“The last few years of my life have not been so very pleasant as to
make me care to look back at them,” he said, bitterly. “Some men keep a
diary of the experiences of each day—I found the experiences tiresome
enough in themselves, and had no wish to incur the extra fatigue of
writing about them. I told my uncle, when he forced a commercial career
upon me, that he was making a mistake; and the result has proved that I
was right.”

Mr. Darrell spoke with as much gentlemanly indifference as if he had
been discussing the affairs of a stranger. He evidently thought that
the mistakes of his life rested upon other people’s shoulders; and that
it was no shame to him, but rather to his credit as a fine gentleman,
that he had come home penniless and shabby to sponge upon his mother’s
slender income.

“And now you have come back, what do you mean to do?” Mr. Monckton
asked, rather abruptly.

“I shall go in for painting. I’ll work hard, down in this quiet place,
and get a picture ready for the Royal Academy next year. Will you sit
for me, Miss Mason? and you, Miss Vincent? you would make a splendid
Rosalind and Celia. Yes, Mr. Monckton, I shall try the sublime art
whose professors have been the friends of princes.”

“And if you fail——”

“If I fail, I’ll change my name, and turn itinerant portrait-painter.
But I don’t suppose my uncle Maurice means to live for ever. He must
leave his money to somebody. If Providence favours me my respected
aunts may happen to offend him a few hours before his death, and he
may make a will in my favour, in order to revenge himself upon them. I
think that’s generally the way of it, eh, Mr. Monckton? The testator
doesn’t consider the delight of the person who _is_ to get his money,
but gloats over the aggravation of the poor wretch who _isn’t_.”

The young man spoke as carelessly as if the Woodlands fortune were
scarcely worth a discussion. It was his habit to speak indifferently
of all things, and it was rather difficult to penetrate his real
sentiments, so skilfully were they hidden by this surface manner.

“You had a formidable rival once in your uncle’s affections,” Mr.
Monckton said, presently.

“Which rival?”

“The Damon of Maurice de Crespigny’s youth, George Vandeleur Vane.”

Launcelot Darrell’s face darkened at the mention of the dead man’s
name. It had always been the habit of the De Crespigny family to look
upon Eleanor’s father as a subtle and designing foe, against whom no
warfare could be too desperate.

“My uncle could never have been such a fool as to leave his money to
that spendthrift,” Mr. Darrell said.

Eleanor had been sitting at an open window busy with her work during
this conversation; but she rose hastily as Launcelot spoke of her
father. She was ready to do battle for him then and there, if need
were. She was ready to fling off the disguise of her false name, and to
avow herself as George Vane’s daughter, if they dared to slander him.
Whatever shame or humiliation was cast upon him should be shared by her.

But before she could give way to this sudden impulse, Gilbert Monckton
spoke, and the angry girl waited to near what he might say.

“I have every reason to believe that Maurice de Crespigny would have
left his money to his old friend had Mr. Vane lived,” the lawyer said.
“I never shall forget your uncle’s grief when he read the account of
the old man’s death in a ‘Galignani’ which was put purposely in his way
by one of your aunts.”

“Ah,” said Mr. Darrell, bitterly, “George Vane’s death cleared the way
for those harpies.”

“Or for you, perhaps.”

“Perhaps. I have not come home to wait for a dead man’s shoes, Mr.
Monckton.”

Mrs. Darrell had been listening to this conversation, with her watchful
eyes fixed upon Gilbert Monckton’s face. She spoke now for the first
time.

“My son is the proper person to inherit my uncle’s fortune,” she said;
“he is young, and has a bright future before him. Money would be of
some use to _him_; but it would be almost useless to my sisters.”

She glanced at the young man as she spoke; and in that one kindling
glance of maternal pride the widow revealed how much she loved her son.

The young man was leaning in a lounging attitude over the piano,
turning the leaves of Laura’s open music-book, and now and then
striking his fingers on the notes.

Mr. Monckton took up his hat, shook hands with his ward and with Mrs.
Darrell, and then went over to the window at which Eleanor sat.

“How silent you have been this morning, Miss Vincent,” he said.

The girl blushed as she looked up at the lawyer’s grave face. She
always felt ashamed of her false name when Mr. Monckton addressed her
by it.

“When are you and Laura coming to see my new picture?” he asked.

“Whenever Mrs. Darrell likes to bring us,” Eleanor answered, frankly.

“You hear, Mrs. Darrell?” said the lawyer; “these two young ladies
are coming over to Tolldale to see a genuine Raphael that I bought at
Christie’s a month ago. You will be taking your son to see his uncle, I
have no doubt—suppose you come and lunch at the Priory on the day you
go to Woodlands.”

“That will be to-morrow,” answered Mrs. Darrell. “My uncle cannot deny
himself to Launcelot after an absence of nearly five years, and even my
sisters can scarcely have the impertinence to shut the door in my son’s
face.”

“Very well; Woodlands and the Priory lie close together. You can cross
the park and get into Mr. de Crespigny’s grounds by the wicket-gate,
and so surprise the enemy. That will be the best plan.”

“If you please, my dear Mr. Monckton,” said the widow.

She was gratified at the idea of stealing a march upon her maiden
sisters, for she knew how difficult it was to effect an entrance to the
citadel so jealously guarded by them.

“Come, young ladies,” exclaimed Mr. Monckton, as he crossed the
threshold of the bay window, “will you honour me with your company to
the gates?”

The two girls rose and went out on to the lawn with the lawyer. Laura
Mason was accustomed to obey her guardian, and Eleanor was very well
pleased to pay all possible respect to Gilbert Monckton. She looked up
to him as something removed from the commonplace sphere in which she
felt so fettered and helpless. She fancied sometimes that if she could
have told him the story of her father’s death, he might have helped her
to find the old man’s destroyer. She had that implicit confidence in
his power which a young and inexperienced woman almost always feels for
a man of superior intellect who is twenty years her senior.

Mr. Monckton and the two girls walked slowly across the grass; but
Laura Mason was distracted by her dogs before she reached the gate,
and ran away into one of the shrubberied pathways after the refractory
Italian greyhound.

The lawyer stopped at the gate. He was silent for some moments, looking
thoughtfully at Eleanor, as if he had something particular to say to
her.

“Well, Miss Vincent, how do you like Mr. Launcelot Darrell?” he asked
at last.

The question seemed rather insignificant after the pause that had
preceded it.

Eleanor hesitated.

“I scarcely know whether I like or dislike him,” she said; “he only
came the night before last, and——”

“And my question is what we call a leading one. Never mind, you shall
tell me what you think by-and-by, when you have had more time to form
an opinion. You think the young man handsome, I suppose?”

“Oh, yes! very handsome.”

“But you are not the girl to be fascinated by a handsome face. I can
see that you mean that by the contemptuous curl of your lip. Quite
true, no doubt, Miss Vincent; but there are some young ladies less
strong-minded than yourself, who may be easily bewitched by the outline
of a classical profile, or the light of a pair of handsome dark eyes.
Eleanor Vincent, do you remember what I said to you when I brought you
down to Hazlewood?”

Mr. Monckton was in the habit of addressing both the girls by their
Christian names when he spoke seriously.

“Yes, I remember perfectly.”

“What I said to you then implied an amount of trust which I don’t often
put in an acquaintance of a couple of hours. That little girl yonder,”
added the lawyer, glancing towards the pathway in which Laura Mason
flitted about, alternately coaxing and remonstrating with her dogs, “is
tender-hearted and weak-headed. I think you would willingly do anything
to serve her and me. You can do her no better service than by shielding
her from the influence of Launcelot Darrell. Don’t let my ward fall in
love with the young man’s handsome face, Miss Vincent!”

Eleanor was silent, scarcely knowing how to reply to this strange
appeal.

“You think I am taking alarm too soon, I dare say,” the lawyer said,
“but in our profession we learn to look a long way ahead. I don’t
like the young man, Miss Vincent. He is selfish, and shallow, and
frivolous,—false, I think, as well. And, more than this, there is a
secret in his life.”

“A secret?”

“Yes; and that secret is connected with his Indian experiences.”




CHAPTER XVII.

THE SHADOW ON GILBERT MONCKTON’S LIFE.


Tolldale Priory was a red brick mansion, lying deep in a valley,
almost hidden amidst the thick woodland that surrounded it; a stately
dwelling-place, shrouded and well-nigh entombed by the old trees that
shut it in on every side, and made a screen through which only a
glimpse of crimson brick could be seen from the bye-road or lane that
approached the great iron gates.

From the hill-tops, high above the wooded valley, looking down into the
sombre depths of verdure, one could see the gabled roof of the mansion,
glimmering amid the woodland, like some rich jewel in its casket; and,
at a little distance, the massive square tower of an ivy-grown old
church, at which a few tenant-farmers about Tolldale, and the lords of
the Priory and their retainers, were wont to worship.

The house was large and handsome; there was a long banqueting hall with
a roof of black oak, rich in quaint carvings, and a gloomy corridor,
which were said to belong to the reign of Henry the Second; but the
rest of the mansion had been built in the time of Queen Anne, and was
of that prim and square order of architecture which Sir John Vanbrugh
and his followers affected.

The garden was prim and square, like the house, and shut in from the
road by high red brick walls, over some part of which the stone-moss
had crept, and the ivy trailed for centuries; but the garden had grown
out of the stiffness of Queen Anne’s day, for every tree and shrub,
every flower and weed, patch of grass, or cluster of ivy, grew so
luxuriantly in this fertile valley, that it would have needed three
times the number of gardeners that had been kept at Tolldale for the
last twenty years, to preserve the neat order of the flower-beds and
pathways, the holly hedges, the huge bushes of boxwood that had once
been fashioned into the grim semblances of lions, swans, dragons, and
elephants, and all the other stiff beauties of the pleasure-grounds.

Behind the house a couple of peacocks stalked moodily about a stony
courtyard, and a great watch-dog showed his sulky head at the mouth of
his kennel, and barked incessantly at the advent of any visitor, as
if the Priory had been some weird and enchanted dwelling to which no
stranger had right of approach. The entrance to the house most commonly
used, opened into this stony courtyard; and in the dusky, flagged hall,
hung the ponderous and roomy riding-boots and the heavy saddle of some
Tolldale who had distinguished himself in the civil wars.

The rainbow colours that glimmered on the stone pavement of this dusky
entrance-hall were reflected from the crests and coats of arms, the
interlaced ciphers, the coronets and bloody hands, emblazoned on the
mullioned windows, whose splendour chastened and subdued the daylight;
tempering the garish glory of heaven for the benefit of aristocratic
eyes. But of all these crests and ciphers, of all these honourable
insignia, not one belonged to the present owner of the house—Mr.
Gilbert Monckton, the lawyer.

Tolldale Priory had changed hands several times since the monkish
days, in which the older part of the house had been built. Gilbert
Monckton had bought the estate twenty years before of a Mr. Ravenshaw,
a reckless and extravagant gentleman, with an only daughter, whose
beauty had been very much talked about in the neighbourhood. Indeed,
report had gone so far as to declare that Gilbert Monckton had been
desperately in love with this Margaret Ravenshaw, and that it was for
her sake he had invested a great part of the splendid fortune left him
by his father in the purchase of the Tolldale estate; thereby freeing
the young lady’s father from very terrible embarrassments, and enabling
him to retire to the Continent with his only child.

There had been, certainly, considerable grounds for this report, as,
immediately after the transfer of the property, Gilbert Monckton
quitted England, leaving his business in the hands of the two junior
partners of the house—both much older men than himself, by the bye.
He remained abroad for nearly two years; during which time everybody
believed him to be travelling with Mr. Ravenshaw and his daughter, and
at the end of that time returned—an altered man.

Yes; every one who had been intimate with Gilbert Monckton declared
that a blight had fallen upon his life; and it was only natural that
they should go a little farther than this, and conclude that this
change had been brought about by an unhappy attachment; or, in plainer
words, that Margaret Ravenshaw had jilted him.

However this might be, the lawyer kept his secret. There was no unmanly
sentimentalism in his nature. Whatever his sorrow was, he bore it very
quietly, keeping it entirely to himself, and asking sympathy from no
living creature. But from the hour of his return to England, he devoted
himself to his profession with a determination and an assiduity that he
had never before displayed.

This was the great change that his disappointment—whatever that
disappointment may have been—had made in him. He did not become either
a misanthrope or a bore. He became purely and simply a man of business.
The frank, generous-hearted young squire, who had shunned his father’s
office as if every sheet of parchment or scrap of red tape had been
infected by the pestilent vapours of a plague-stricken city, was
transformed into a patient and plodding lawyer, whose gigantic grasp of
thought and unfailing foresight were almost akin to genius.

For ten years Tolldale Priory was uninhabited by its new master,
and left in the care of a snuff-taking old housekeeper, and a deaf
gardener, who effectually kept all visitors at bay by a systematic
habit of failing to hear the great bell at the iron gates; which
might clang never so loudly under the shadow of its wooden pent-house
without apparently producing the faintest impression upon the aural
nerves of these two superannuated retainers. But at last the day came
upon which Mr. Monckton grew tired of his London dwelling-place in a
dingy square in Bloomsbury, and determined to take possession of his
Berkshire estate. He sent a couple of upholsterers to Tolldale Priory,
with strict injunctions to set the old furniture in order, but to do
nothing more; not so much as to alter the adjustment of a curtain, or
the accustomed position of a chair or table.

Perhaps he wished to see the familiar rooms looking exactly as they
had looked when he had sat by Margaret Ravenshaw’s side, a bright and
hopeful lad of twenty. He kept the snuff-taking old housekeeper and the
deaf gardener, and brought his own small staff of well-trained servants
from London. The town-bred servants would have willingly rebelled
against their new dwelling-place, and the verdant shades that seemed to
shut them in from the outer world; but their wages were too liberal to
be resigned for any but a very powerful reason, and they submitted as
best they could to the solitude of their new abode.

Mr. Monckton travelled backwards and forwards between Tolldale and
London almost every day, driving to the station in his phaeton in the
morning, and being met by his groom on his return in the evening. The
lawyer’s professional duties had taxed his strength to the utmost,
and grave physicians had prescribed country air and occasional repose
as absolutely necessary to him. For nearly ten years, therefore, he
had lived at the Priory, forming few acquaintances, and positively
no friends. His most intimate associates had been the De Crespignys.
This had no doubt arisen from the circumstance of the Woodlands estate
adjoining Tolldale. Mr. Monckton accepted the acquaintances whom
accident forced upon him, but he sought none. Those who knew him best
said that the shadow which had so early fallen upon his life had never
passed away.

Of course Eleanor Vane had heard these things during her residence at
Hazlewood. The knowledge of them invested the grave lawyer with a halo
of romance in her girlish eyes. He, like herself, had his secret, and
kept it faithfully.




CHAPTER XVIII

UNFORGOTTEN.


Mrs. Darrell drove her son and the two girls to Tolldale Priory in
accordance with Mr. Monckton’s wish. The widow had no particular desire
to bring either Laura or Eleanor into contact with her uncle, Maurice
de Crespigny; for she nourished that intense jealousy of all visitors
who crossed the threshold of the old man’s house, which is only known
to expectant heirs whose chances of a fortune tremble in the wavering
balance of an invalid’s caprice. But Mrs. Darrell could not afford to
offend Mr. Monckton. He paid a high price for her protection of his
ward, and was by no means the sort of man to be thwarted with impunity.

Launcelot Darrell lolled by his mother’s side, smoking a cigar and
taking very little notice of the blossoming hedgerows and glimpses of
luxuriant pastoral landscape. The two young ladies sat upon a low seat,
with their backs to the ponies, and had therefore ample opportunity of
observing the prodigal son’s face.

For the first time since Mr. Darrell’s return Eleanor Vane did watch
that handsome face, seeking in it for some evidence of those words
which Gilbert Monckton had spoken to her the day before.

“He is selfish, and shallow, and frivolous; false, I think, as well;
more than this, he has a secret—a secret connected with his Indian
experiences.”

This is what Mr. Monckton had said. Eleanor asked herself what right he
had to say so much?

It was scarcely likely that a girl of Eleanor’s age, so unaccustomed
to all society, so shut in from the outer world by her narrow and
secluded life, could fail to be a little interested in the handsome
stranger, whose advent had not been without a tinge of romance. She was
interested in him, and all the more so because of that which Gilbert
Monckton had said to her. There was a secret in Launcelot Darrell’s
life. How strange this was! Had every creature a secret, part of
themselves, hidden deep in their breasts, like that dark purpose which
had grown out of the misery of her father’s untimely death—some buried
memory, whose influence was to overshadow all their lives?

She looked at the young man’s face. It had an expression of
half-defiant recklessness which seemed almost habitual to it; but it
was not the face of a happy man.

Laura Mason was the only person who talked much during that drive
to Tolldale. That young lady’s tongue ran on in a pretty, incessant
babble, about nothing in particular. The wild flowers in the
hedgerows, the distant glimpses of country, the light clouds floating
in the summer sky, the flaming poppies among the ripening corn, the
noisy fowl upon the margin of a pond, the shaggy horses looking over
farm-yard gates, every object, animate and inanimate, between Hazlewood
and Tolldale, was the subject of Miss Mason’s remark. Launcelot
Darrell looked at her now and then with an expression of half-admiring
amusement, and sometimes aroused himself to talk to her; but only to
relapse very quickly into a half-contemptuous, half-sulky silence.

Mr. Monckton received his guests in a long low library, looking out
into the neglected garden; a dusky chamber, darkened by the shadows
of trailing parasites that hung over the narrow windows. But this
room was an especial favourite with the grave master of the house.
It was here he sat during the lonely evenings that he spent at home.
The drawing-rooms on the first floor were only used upon those rare
occasions when the lawyer opened his house to his friends of long
standing, dashing clients, who were very well pleased to get a week’s
shooting in the woody coverts about the Priory.

Neither Laura nor Eleanor felt very enthusiastic about the Raphael,
which seemed to the two girls to represent an angular and rather
insipid type of female beauty; but Launcelot Darrell and his host
entered into an artistic discussion that lasted until luncheon was
announced by the lawyer’s grey-haired butler; a ponderous and dignified
individual who had lived with Gilbert Monckton’s father, and who was
said to know more about his master’s history than Gilbert’s most
intimate friends.

It was nearly three o’clock in the afternoon when luncheon was
finished, and the party set out to attempt an invasion upon Woodlands.
Launcelot Darrell gave his arm to his mother, who in a manner took
possession of her son, and the two girls walked behind with the lawyer.

“You have never seen Mr. de Crespigny, I suppose, Miss Vincent?”
Gilbert Monckton said, as they went out of the iron gates and struck
into a narrow pathway leading through the wood.

“Never! But I am very anxious to see him.”

“Why so?”

Eleanor hesitated. She was for ever being reminded of her assumed name,
and the falsehood to which she had submitted out of deference to her
half-sister’s pride.

Fortunately the lawyer did not wait for an answer to his question.

“Maurice de Crespigny is a strange old man,” he said; “a very strange
old man. I sometimes think there is a disappointment in store for
Launcelot Darrell; and for his maiden aunts as well.”

“A disappointment!”

“Yes, I doubt very much if either the maiden ladies or their nephews
will get Maurice de Crespigny’s fortune.”

“But to whom will he leave it, then?”

The lawyer shrugged his shoulders.

“It is not for me to answer that question, Miss Vincent,” he said. “I
merely speculate upon the chances, in perfect ignorance as to facts.
Were I Mr. de Crespigny’s legal adviser, I should have no right to say
as much as this; but as I am not, I am free to discuss the business.”

Mr. Monckton and Eleanor were alone by this time, for Laura Mason
had flitted on to the party in advance, and was talking to Launcelot
Darrell. The lawyer’s face clouded as he watched his ward and the young
man.

“You remember what I said to you yesterday, Miss Vincent?” he said,
after a pause.

“Perfectly.”

“I am very much afraid of the influence that young man’s handsome face
may have upon my poor frivolous ward. I would move her out of the
way of that influence if I could, but where could I remove her? Poor
child! she has been shifted about enough already. She seems happy at
Hazlewood; very happy, with you.”

“Yes,” Eleanor answered, frankly; “we love each other very dearly.”

“And you would do anything to serve her?”

“Anything in the world.”

Mr. Monckton sighed.

“There is one way in which you might serve her,” he said, in a low
voice, as if speaking to himself rather than to Eleanor, “and yet——”

He did not finish the sentence, but walked on in silence, with his eyes
bent upon the ground. He only looked up now and then to listen, with an
uneasy expression, to the animated conversation of Launcelot and Laura.
They walked thus through the shadowy woodland, where the rustling sound
of a pheasant’s flight amongst the brushwood, and the gay tones of
Laura’s voice, only broke the silence.

Beyond the wood they came to a grassy slope dotted by groups of trees,
and bounded by an invisible wire fence.

Here, on the summit of a gentle elevation, stood a low white villa—a
large and important house—but built in the modern style, and very
inferior to Tolldale Priory in dignity and grandeur.

This was Woodlands, the house which Maurice de Crespigny had built for
himself some thirty years before; the house whose threshold had so long
been jealously guarded by the invalid’s maiden nieces.

Mr. Monckton looked at his watch as he and Eleanor joined Mrs. Darrell.

“Half-past three o’clock,” he said; “Mr. de Crespigny generally takes
an airing in his Bath-chair at about this time in the afternoon. You
see, I know the habits of the Citadel, and know therefore how to effect
a surprise. If we strike across the park we are almost sure to meet
him.”

He led the way to a little gate in the fence. It was only fastened by a
latch, and the party entered the grassy enclosure.

Eleanor Vane’s heart beat violently. She was about to see her father’s
old and early friend; that friend whom George Vane had never been
suffered to approach, to whom he had been forbidden to appeal in the
hour of his distress.

“If my poor father could have written to Mr. de Crespigny for help when
he lost that wretched hundred pounds, he might have been saved from a
cruel death,” Eleanor thought.

Fortune seemed to favour the invaders. In a shady avenue that skirted
one side of the slope, they came upon the old man and the two sisters.
The maiden ladies walked on either side of their uncle’s Bath-chair,
erect and formidable-looking as a couple of grenadiers.

Maurice de Crespigny looked twenty years older than his spendthrift
friend had looked up to the hour of his death. His bent head nodded
helplessly forward. His faded eyes seemed dim and sightless. The
withered hand lying idle upon the leathern apron of the Bath-chair,
trembled like a leaf shaken by the autumn wind. The shadow of
approaching death seemed to hover about this feeble creature,
separating him from his fellow-mortals.

The two maiden ladies greeted their sister with no very demonstrative
cordiality.

“Ellen!” exclaimed Miss Lavinia, the elder of the two, “this is an
unexpected pleasure. I am sure that both Sarah and myself are charmed
to see you; but as this is one of our poor dear invalid’s worst days,
your visit is rather unfortunately timed. If you had written, and given
us notice of your coming——”

“You would have shut the door in my face,” Mrs. Darrell said,
resolutely. “Pray do not put yourself to the trouble of inventing
any polite fictions on my account, Lavinia. We understand each other
perfectly. I came here by the back way, because I knew I should be
refused admittance at the front door. You keep watch well, Lavinia, and
I beg to compliment you upon your patience.”

The widow had approached her uncle’s chair, leaving the rest of the
party in the background. Pale and defiant, she did battle with her
two sisters, fighting sturdily in the cause of her idolized son, who
seemed a great deal too listless and indifferent to look after his own
interests.

The ladies in possession glared at their sister’s pale face with
spiteful eyes; they were a little daunted by the widow’s air of
resolution.

“Who are these people, Ellen Darrell?” asked the younger of the two
old maids. “Do you want to kill my uncle, that you bring a crowd of
strangers to intrude upon him at a time when his nerves are at their
worst?”

“I have not brought a crowd of strangers. One of those people is my
son, who has come to pay his respects to his uncle after his return
from India.”

“Launcelot Darrell returned!” exclaimed the two ladies, simultaneously.

“Yes, returned to look after his own interests; returned with very
grateful feelings towards those who prompted his being sent away from
his native country to waste his youth in an unhealthy climate.”

“_Some_ people get on in India,” Miss Lavinia de Crespigny said,
spitefully; “but I never thought Launcelot Darrell would do any good
there.”

“How kind it was in you to advise his going, then,” Mrs. Darrell
answered, promptly. Then, passing by the astonished Miss Lavinia, she
went up to her uncle, and bent over him.

The old man looked up at his niece, but with no glance of recognition
in his blue eyes, which had grown pale with age.

“Uncle Maurice,” said Mrs. Darrell, “don’t you know me?”

The invalid nodded his head.

“Yes, yes, yes!” he said; but there was a vacant smile upon his face,
and it seemed as if the words were uttered mechanically.

“And are you glad to see me, dear uncle?”

“Yes, yes, yes!” the old man answered in exactly the same tone.

Mrs. Darrell looked up hopelessly.

“Is he always like this?” she asked.

“No,” answered Miss Sarah, briskly, “he is only so when he is intruded
upon and annoyed. We told you it was one of your uncle’s bad days,
Ellen; and yet you are heartless enough to insist on persecuting him.”

Mrs. Darrell turned upon her sister with suppressed rage.

“When will the day come in which I shall be welcome to this place,
Sarah de Crespigny?” she said. “I choose my own time, and seize any
chance I can of speaking to my uncle.”

She looked back at the group she had left behind her, and beckoned to
her son.

Launcelot Darrell came straight to his uncle’s chair.

“You remember Launcelot, Uncle Maurice,” Mrs. Darrell said,
entreatingly; “I’m sure you remember Launcelot.”

The two maiden sisters watched their uncle’s face with eager and
jealous glances. It seemed as if the thick clouds were clearing away
from the old man’s memory, for a faint light kindled in his faded eyes.

“Launcelot!” he said; “yes, I remember Launcelot. In India, poor lad,
in India.”

“He went to India, dear uncle, and he has been away some years. You
remember how unfortunate he was: the indigo planter to whom he was to
have gone failed before he got to Calcutta, so that my poor boy could
not even deliver the one letter of introduction which he took with him
to a strange country. He was thrown upon his own resources, therefore,
and had to get a living as he could. The climate never agreed with him,
Uncle Maurice, and he was altogether very unhappy. He stayed in India
as long as he could endure a life that was utterly unsuited to him; and
then flung everything up for the sake of returning to England. You must
not be angry with my poor boy, dear Uncle Maurice.”

The old man seemed to have brightened up a good deal by this time. He
nodded perpetually as his niece talked to him, but there was a look of
intelligence in his face now.

“I am not angry with him,” he said; “he was free to go; or free to
return. I did the best I could for him; but of course he was free to
choose his own career, and is so still. I don’t expect him to defer to
me.”

Mrs. Darrell turned pale. This speech appeared to express a
renunciation of all interest in her son. She would almost rather that
her uncle had been angry and indignant at the young man’s return.

“But Launcelot wishes to please you in all he does, dear uncle,”
pleaded the widow. “He will be very, very sorry if he has offended you.”

“He is very good,” the old man answered; “he has not offended me. He is
quite free, quite free to act for himself. I did the best I could for
him—I did the best; but he is perfectly free.”

The two maiden sisters exchanged a look of triumph. In this
hand-to-hand contest for the rich man’s favour, it did not seem as if
either Ellen Darrell or her son were gaining any great advantage.

Launcelot bent over his great-uncle’s chair.

“I am very happy to find you alive and well, sir, on my return,” he
said, respectfully.

The old man lifted his eyes, and looked earnestly at the handsome face
bent over him.

“You are very good, nephew,” he said; “I sometimes think that, because
I have a little money to leave behind me, everybody wishes for my
death. It’s hard to fancy that every breath one draws is grudged by
those who live with us. That’s very hard!”

“Uncle!” cried the maiden nieces, simultaneously, with a little shriek
of ladylike horror. “When have you ever fancied that?”

The old man shook his head, with a feeble smile upon his tremulous lips.

“You are very good to me, my dears,” he said, “very good but, sick men
have strange fancies. I sometimes think I’ve lived too long for myself
and others. But never mind that; never mind that. Who are those people
there?” he asked, in a different tone.

“Friends of mine, uncle,” Mrs. Darrell answered; “and one of them is a
friend of yours. You know Mr. Monckton?”

“Monckton! Oh, yes—yes! Monckton, the lawyer,” muttered the old man;
“and who is that girl yonder?” he cried suddenly, with quite an altered
voice and manner, almost as if the shock of some great surprise had
galvanized him into new life. “Who is that girl yonder, with fair hair
and her face turned this way? Tell me who she is, Ellen Darrell.”

He pointed to Eleanor Vane as he spoke. She was standing a little way
apart from Gilbert Monckton and Laura; she had taken off her broad
straw hat and slung it across her arm, and the warm summer breeze had
swept the bright auburn hair from her forehead. Forgetful of every
necessity for caution, in the intensity of her desire to see her
dead father’s dearest friend, she had advanced a few paces from her
companions, and stood watching the group about the old man’s chair.

“Who is she, Ellen Darrell?” repeated Mr. de Crespigny.

Mrs. Darrell looked almost frightened by her uncle’s eagerness.

“That young lady is only the musical instructress of another young lady
I have in my care, Uncle Maurice,” she answered. “What is there in her
that attracts your attention?”

The old man’s eyes filled with tears that rolled slowly down his
withered cheeks.

“When George Vane and I were students together at Maudlin,” answered
Maurice de Crespigny, “my friend was the living image of that girl.”

Mrs. Darrell turned sharply round; and looked at Eleanor at if she
would have almost annihilated the girl for daring to resemble George
Vane.

“I think your eyes must deceive you, my dear uncle,” said the widow; “I
knew Mr. Vane well enough, and I never saw any likeness to him in this
Miss Vincent.”

Maurice de Crespigny shook his head.

“My eyes do not deceive me,” he said. “It’s my memory that’s weak,
sometimes; my eyesight is good enough. When you knew George Vane his
hair was grey, and his handsome looks faded; when I first knew him he
was as young as that girl yonder, and he was like her. Poor George!
poor George!”

The three sisters looked at each other. Whatever enmity might exist
between Mrs. Darrell and the two maiden ladies, the three were
perfectly agreed upon one point—namely, that the recollection of George
Vane and his family must, at any price, be kept out of Maurice de
Crespigny’s mind.

The old man had not spoken of his friend for years, and the maiden
sisters had triumphed in the thought that all memories of their uncle’s
youth had become obscured and obliterated by the gathering shadows of
age. But now, at the sight of a fair-haired girl of eighteen, the old
memories came back in all their force. The sudden outburst of feeling
came upon the sisters like a thunderbolt, and they lost that common
instinct of self-preservation, that ordinary presence of mind, which
would have prompted them to hustle the old man off, and carry him at
once out of the way of this tiresome, intrusive, fair-haired young
woman, who had the impertinence to resemble George Vane.

The sisters had never heard of the birth of Mr. Vane’s youngest
daughter. Many years had elapsed since the intercourse between Mrs.
Darrell and Hortensia Bannister had extended to more than an occasional
epistolary communication, and the stockbroker’s widow had not thought
it necessary to make any formal announcement of her half-sister’s birth.

“Tell that girl to come here,” cried Maurice de Crespigny, pointing
with a trembling hand to Eleanor. “Let her come here; I want to look at
her.”

Mrs. Darrell thought it would be scarcely wise to oppose her uncle.

“Miss Vincent!” she called, sharply, to the girl; “come here, if you
please; my uncle wishes to speak to you.”

Eleanor Vane was startled by the widow’s summons, but she came eagerly
to the old man’s chair. She was very anxious to see the friend of her
dead father. She went close up to the Bath-chair, and stood beside the
old man.

Maurice de Crespigny laid his hand upon hers.

“Yes,” he said; “yes, yes. It’s almost the same face—almost the same.
God bless you, my dear! It makes me fifty years younger to look at you.
You are like a friend who was once very dear to me—very dear to me. God
bless you!”

The girl’s face grew pale with the intensity of her feeling. Oh! that
her father had been alive; that she might have pleaded for him with
this old man, and have reunited the broken links of the past. But of
what avail now were Maurice de Crespigny’s compassionate words? They
could not recall the dead. They could not blot out the misery of that
horrible night upon which the loss of a pitiful sum of money had driven
George Vane to the commission of the fatal act which had ended his
life. No! His old friend could do nothing for him; his loving daughter
could do nothing for him—except to avenge his death.

Carried away by her feelings; forgetful of her assumed character;
forgetful of everything except that the hand now clasped in hers was
the same that had been linked in that of her father, years and years
ago, in the warm grasp of friendship; Eleanor Vane knelt down beside
the old man’s chair, and pressed his thin fingers to her lips.




CHAPTER XIX.

LIKE THE MEMORY OF A DREAM.


Mrs. Darrell drove away from Tolldale Priory late in the afternoon,
and in a very despondent state of mind. She had done no good by her
visit to Woodlands, and it seemed painfully probable that she had done
a great deal of harm; for the unfortunate accident of a resemblance
between Laura Mason’s companion and the late George Vane had stirred
up the memories of the past in that turbid stream, the old man’s
mind. The widow scarcely opened her lips during the homeward drive.
She would fain have punished Eleanor for that unlucky chance by which
she happened to resemble the dead man, and she did not fail to remark
unpleasantly upon Miss Vane’s conduct at Woodlands.

“One would really think you wished to trade upon your likeness to Mr.
Vane, and to insinuate yourself into my uncle’s good graces, Miss
Vincent,” the widow said, rather sharply.

Eleanor blushed crimson, but did not attempt to reply to her employer’s
bitter speech. The falsehood of an assumed name was perpetually placing
her in positions against which her truthful nature revolted.

If Mrs. Darrell had been free to dismiss Eleanor Vane, she would
doubtless have done so, for the girl’s presence had now become a source
of alarm to her. There were two reasons for this sentiment of alarm.
First, the likeness which Maurice de Crespigny had discovered between
Eleanor and his dead friend, and which might prompt him at any moment
to some capricious fancy for the girl; and, secondly, the fact that
Eleanor’s beauty and fascination might not be without their effect upon
Launcelot Darrell.

The widow knew by cruel experience that her son was not a man to
surrender his lightest caprice at the entreaty of another. At
seven-and-twenty years of age he was as much a spoiled child as he had
been at seven. Ellen Darrell looked back at the bitter trials of the
past; and remembered how hard it had been to keep her son true even to
his own interests. Selfish and self-willed, he had taken his own way;
always relying upon his handsome face, his shallow versatility, his
showy accomplishments, to carry him through every difficulty, and get
him out of every dilemma; always eager for the enjoyment of the present
hour, and reckless as to any penalties to be paid in the future.

Mrs. Darrell had concentrated every feeling of her heart into one
passion: her love for this young man. Frigid and reserved to all the
rest of the world, with him she was impulsive, vehement, spontaneous;
ready to pour out her heart’s blood at his feet, if he had needed such
an evidence of her devotion. For him she was jealous and exacting;
harsh to others; desperate and unforgiving to those whom she thought
his enemies.

For Launcelot she was anxious and ambitious. The hope that her Uncle
Maurice would leave his fortune to the young man, whose boyish good
looks and precocious talents had made some impression upon him, many
years before, never entirely deserted her. But, even if that hope
should fail, her sisters were elderly women like herself. If they
succeeded in cajoling Maurice de Crespigny out of his fortune, they
must surely eventually leave it to their only nephew, Launcelot. This
was how the widow reasoned. But there was another chance which she
fancied she saw for her son’s advancement. Laura Mason, the heiress,
evidently admired the young man’s handsome face and dashing manners.
What more likely than that Launcelot might succeed in winning the hand
and fortune of that capricious young lady?

Under these circumstances Mrs. Darrell would have been very glad to
have removed Eleanor Vane out of her son’s way; but this was not easily
to be done. When the widow sounded Laura Mason upon the subject, and
vaguely hinted at the necessity of parting with Eleanor, the heiress
burst into a flood of tears, and declared passionately that she would
not live without her darling Nelly. And when Mrs. Darrell went even
further than this, and touched upon the subject in a conversation with
Mr. Monckton, the lawyer replied very decidedly that he considered Miss
Vincent’s companionship of great benefit to his ward, and that he could
not hear of any arrangement by which the two girls would be separated.

Mrs. Darrell, therefore, could do nothing but submit; in the hope that
for once her son might consent to be governed by his interests, rather
than by those erratic impulses which had led him in the reckless and
riotous days of his early youth.

She pleaded with him; entreating him to be prudent and thoughtful for
the future.

“You have suffered so much from poverty, Launcelot,” she urged, “that
surely you will lose no opportunity of improving your position. Look
back, my boy; remember that bitter time in which you were lost to me,
led away by low and vicious companions, and only appealing to me when
you found yourself in debt and difficulty. Think of your Indian life,
and the years you have wasted,—you who are so clever and accomplished,
and who ought to have been so fortunate. Oh, Launcelot, if you knew
what a bitter thing it is to a mother to see her idolized child waste
every opportunity of winning the advancement which should be his by
right,—yes, by right, Launcelot, by the right of your talents. I never
reproached you, my boy, for coming home to me penniless. Were you to
return to me twenty times, as you came back that night, you would
always find the same welcome, the same affection. My love for you
will never change, my darling, till I go to my grave. But I suffer
very bitterly when I think of your wasted youth. You must be rich,
Launcelot; you cannot afford to be poor. There are some men to whom
poverty seems a spur that drives them on to greatness; but it has
clogged your footsteps, and held you back from the fame you might have
won.”

“Egad, so it has, mother,” the young man answered, bitterly; “a shabby
coat paralyzes a man’s arm, to my mind, and it’s not very easy for a
fellow to hold his head very high when the nap’s all worn off his hat.
But I don’t mean to sit down to a life of idleness, I can tell you,
mother. I shall turn painter. You know I’ve got on with my painting
pretty well during the last few years.”

“I’m glad of that, my dear boy. You had plenty of time to devote to
your painting, then?”

“Plenty of time; oh, yes, I was pretty well off for that matter.”

“Then you were not so hard worked in India?”

“Not always. That depended upon circumstances,” the young man answered,
indifferently. “Yes, mother, I shall turn painter, and try and make a
fortune out of my brush.”

Mrs. Darrell sighed. She wished to see her son made rich by a quicker
road than the slow and toilsome pathway by which an artist reaches
fortune.

“If you could make a wealthy marriage, Launcelot,” she said, “you
might afford to devote yourself to art, without having to endure the
torturing anxieties which must be suffered by a man who has only his
profession to depend upon. I wouldn’t for the world wish you to sell
yourself for money, for I know the wretchedness of a really mercenary
marriage; but if——”

The young man flung back the dark hair from his forehead, and smiled at
his mother as he interrupted her.

“If I should fall in love with this Miss Laura Mason, who, according to
your account, is to have a power of money one of these days, I should
prove myself a wise man. That’s what you mean, isn’t it, _madre mia_?
Well, I’ll do my best. The young lady is pretty, but her childishness
is positively _impayable_. What’s the amount of the fortune that is to
counterbalance so much empty-headed frivolity? Eh, mother?”

“I can’t quite answer that question, Launcelot. I only know that Mr.
Monckton told me Laura will be very rich.”

“And Gilbert Monckton, although a lawyer, is one of those
uncompromising personages who never tell a lie. Well, mother we’ll see
about it; I can’t say anything more than that.”

The young man had been standing before his easel with his palette and
brushes in his hand during this conversation, now and then adding a
touch here and there to a picture that he had been working at since his
return. He had taken up his abode in his old apartments. His mother
spent a good deal of her time with him; sitting at needlework by the
open window, while he painted; listening while, in his idler moments,
he sat at the piano, composing a few bars of a waltz, or trying to
recall the words of some song that he had written long ago; always
following him with watchful and admiring eyes, shadowed only by the
mother’s anxiety for her son’s future.

Launcelot Darrell did not seem to be altogether a bad young man. He
accepted his mother’s love with something of that indolent selfishness
common to those spoiled children of fortune upon whom an extra share
of maternal devotion has been lavished. He absorbed the widow’s
affection; and gave her in return an easy-going, graceful attention,
which satisfied the unselfish woman, and demanded neither trouble nor
sacrifice from the young man himself.

“Now, if the wealthy heiress were the poor companion, mother,” Mr.
Darrell said, presently, working away with his brush as he spoke,
“your scheme would be charming. Eleanor Vincent is a glorious girl; a
little bit of a spitfire, I should think, quiet and gentle as she is
with us; but a splendid girl; just the sort of wife for an indolent
man; a wife who would rouse him out of his lethargy and drive him on to
distinction.”

Yes, Launcelot Darrell, who had never in his life resisted any
temptation, or accepted any guidance except that of his own wishes, was
led by them now; and, instead of devoting himself to the young heiress,
chose to fall desperately in love with her fair-haired companion. He
fell in love with Eleanor Vane; desperately, after his own fashion. I
doubt if there was any great intensity in the young man’s desperation;
for I do not believe that he was capable of any real depth of feeling.
There was a kind of hollow, tinselly fervour in his nature which took
the place of true passion. It may be that with him all emotions—love
and remorse, penitence, pity, regret, hate, anger, and revenge—were
true and real so long as they lasted. But all these sentiments were
so short-lived, by reason of the fickleness of his mind, that it was
almost difficult to believe even in their temporary truth.

But Eleanor Vane, being very young and inexperienced, had no power
of analyzing the character of her lover. She only knew that he was
handsome, accomplished, and clever; that he loved her, and that it was
very agreeable to be loved by him.

I do not believe that she returned the young man’s affection. She was
like a child upon the threshold of a new world: bewildered and dazzled
by the glorious aspect of the unknown region before her; beguiled and
delighted by its beauty and novelty. All the darker aspects of the
great passion were unknown to her, and undreamed of by her. She only
knew that on the cheerless horizon that had so long bounded her life,
a new star had arisen—a bright and wonderful planet, which for a while
displaced the lurid light that had so long shone steadfastly across the
darkness.

Eleanor Vane yielded herself up to the brief holiday-time which
generally comes once in almost every woman’s life, however desolate and
joyless the rest of that life may be. The holiday comes,—a fleeting
summer of gladness and rejoicing. The earth lights up under a new sun
and moon; the flowers bloom into new colours and scatter new perfumes
on the sublimated atmosphere; the waters of the commonest rivers change
to melted sapphires, and blaze with the splendour of a million jewels
in the sunshine. The dull universe changes to fairyland; but, alas! the
holiday-time is very short: the children grow tired of paradise, or are
summoned back to school; the sun and moon collapse into commonplace
luminaries; the flowers fade into every-day blossoms; the river flows a
grey stream under a November sky; and the dream is over.

Launcelot Darrell had been little more than a fortnight in his
mother’s house when he declared his love for Miss Mason’s companion.
The young people had been a great deal together in that fortnight;
wandering in the grassy lanes about Hazlewood, and in the shadowy woods
round Tolldale Priory, or on breezy hills high up above the lawyer’s
sheltered mansion. In hope of an alliance between Launcelot and Gilbert
Monckton’s ward, Mrs. Darrell was obliged to submit to the necessity
which threw her son very much into the society of the companion as well
as of the heiress.

“He will surely never be so foolish as to thwart my plan for his
future,” thought the anxious mother. “Surely, surely, he will consent
to be guided by his own interests. Gilbert Monckton must know that it
is only likely an attachment may arise between Launcelot and Laura. He
would not leave the girl with me unless he were resigned to such an
event, and ready to give his consent to their marriage. My son is poor,
certainly; but the lawyer knows that he has some hope of inheriting a
great fortune.”

While the mother pondered thus over her son’s chances of advancement,
the young man took life very easily; spending his mornings at his
easel, but by no means over-exerting himself; and dawdling away his
afternoons in rustic rambles with the two girls.

Laura Mason was very happy in the society of this new and brilliant
companion. She was bewitched and fascinated by Mr. Darrell’s careless
talk; which sounded very witty, very profound, sarcastic, and eloquent
in the ears of an ignorant girl. She admired him and fell in love with
him, and wearied poor Eleanor with her very unreserved rhapsodies about
the object of her affection.

“I know it’s very bold and wicked and horrid to fall in love with
anybody before they fall in love with one, you know, Eleanor,” the
young lady said, in not very elegant English; “but he is so handsome
and so clever. I don’t think any one in the world could help loving him.

    “‘I have no hope in loving thee,
      I only ask to love;
    I _ber_-rood upon my silent heart,
      As on its nest a dove;’”

added Miss Mason, quoting that favourite poet of all desponding lovers,
poor L. E. L.

I think Mr. Monckton’s ward rather enjoyed the hopelessness of her
attachment. The brooding upon her silent heart was scarcely an accurate
exposition of her conduct, as she talked reams of sentiment to Eleanor
upon the subject of her unrequited affection. Miss Vane was patient and
tender with her, listening to her foolish talk, and dreading the coming
of that hour in which the childish young beauty must be rudely awakened
from her rose-coloured dream.

“I don’t want to marry him, you know, Eleanor,” the young lady said; “I
only want to be allowed to love him. You remember the German story in
which the knight watches the window of his lost love’s convent cell.
I could live for ever and ever near him; and be content to see him
sometimes; or to hear his voice, even if I did not see him. I should
like to wear boy’s clothes, and be his page, like Viola, and tell him
my own story, you know, some day.”

Eleanor remembered her promise to Gilbert Monckton, and tried sometimes
to check the torrent of sentimental talk.

“I know your love is very poetical, and I dare say it’s very true, my
pet,” she said; “but do you think Mr. Darrell is quite worth all this
waste of affection? I sometimes think, Laura dear, that we commit a sin
when we waste our best feelings. Suppose by-and-by you should meet some
one quite as worthy of your love as Launcelot Darrell; some one who
would love you very devotedly; don’t you think you would look back and
regret having lavished your best and freshest feelings upon a person
who——”

“Who doesn’t care a straw for me,” cried the heiress, half crying.
“That’s what you mean, Eleanor Vincent. You mean to insinuate that
Launcelot doesn’t care for me. You are a cruel, heartless girl, and you
don’t love me a bit.”

And the young lady bemoaned her disappointment, and wept over the
hardships of her lot; very much as she might have cried for any new
plaything a few years before.

It was upon a burning August morning that Launcelot Darrell declared
himself to Eleanor Vane. The two girls had been sitting to him for a
picture,—Eleanor as Rosalind, and Laura as Celia,—a pretty feminine
group. Rosalind in her womanly robes, and not her forester’s dress of
grey and green; for the painter had chosen the scene in which Celia
promises to share her cousin’s exile.

This picture was to be exhibited at the Academy, and was to make Mr.
Darrell’s fortune. Laura had been called from the room to attend to
some important business with a dressmaker from Windsor, and Eleanor and
Launcelot were alone.

The young man went on painting for some time, and then, throwing down
his brush with a gesture of impatience, went over to the window near
which Eleanor sat, on a raised platform covered with a shabby drapery
of red baize.

“Do you think the picture will be a success, Miss Vincent?” he asked.

“Oh yes, I think so, and hope so; but I am no judge, you know.”

“Your judgment must be as good as the public judgment, I should think,”
Launcelot Darrell answered, rather impatiently. “The critics will try
to write me down, I dare say, but I don’t look to the critics to buy my
picture. They’ll call me crude and meretricious, and hard and cold, and
thin and grey, I’ve no doubt; but the best picture, to my mind, is the
picture that sells best, eh, Miss Vincent?”

Eleanor lifted her arched eyebrows with a look of surprise; this very
low view of the question rather jarred upon her sense of the dignity of
art.

“I suppose you think my sentiments very mercenary and contemptible,
Miss Vincent,” said the painter, interpreting the expression of her
face; “but I have lived out the romance of my life; or one part of
that romance, at any rate; and have no very ardent aspiration after
greatness in the abstract. I want to earn money. The need of money
drives men into almost every folly; farther, sometimes: into follies
that touch upon the verge of crime.”

The young man’s face darkened suddenly as he spoke. He was silent for
a few moments, not looking at his companion, but away out of the open
window into vacancy, as it seemed.

The memory of Gilbert Monckton’s words flashed back upon Eleanor’s
mind. “There is a secret in Launcelot Darrell’s life,” the lawyer had
said; “a secret connected with his Indian experience.” Was he thinking
of that secret now, Eleanor wondered. But the painter’s face brightened
almost as suddenly as it had been overshadowed. He flung back his head
with an impetuous gesture. It seemed almost as if he had cast some
imaginary burden from off his shoulders by that sudden movement.

“I want to earn money, Miss Vincent,” he said. “Art in the abstract is
very grand, no doubt. I quite believe in the man who stabbed his model
in order to get the death-agony for his picture of the Crucifixion; but
I must make art subservient to my own necessities. I must earn money
for myself and my wife, Eleanor. I might marry a rich woman, perhaps,
but I want to marry a poor one. Do you think the girl I love will
listen to me, Eleanor? Do you think she will accept the doubtful future
I can offer her? Do you think she will be brave enough to share the
fortunes of a struggling man?”

Nothing could be more heroic than the tone in which Launcelot Darrell
spoke. He had the air of a man who means to strive, with the sturdy
devotion of a martyr, to win the end of his ambition, rather than
that of a sanguine but vacillating young gentleman who would be ready
to fling himself down under the influence of the first moment of
despondency, and live upon the proceeds of the pawning of his watch,
while his unfinished picture rotted upon the canvas.

He had something of George Vane’s nature, perhaps; that fatally hopeful
temperament common to men who are for ever going to do great things,
and for ever failing to achieve even the smallest. He was one of those
men who are perpetually deluding other people by the force of their
power of self-delusion.

Self-deluded and mistaken now, it was scarcely strange if he deceived
Eleanor Vane, who was carried away by the impetuous torrent of words in
which he told her that he loved her, and that the future happiness of
his life depended upon the fiat which must issue from her lips.

Only very faltering accents came from those tremulous lips. Miss
Vane was not in love; she was only bewildered, and perhaps a little
bewitched, by the painter’s vehemence. He was the first young,
elegant, handsome, and accomplished man with whom she had ever been
thrown much in contact. It is scarcely wonderful, then, if this
inexperienced girl of eighteen was a little influenced by the ardour of
his admiration—by the eloquence of his wild talk.

She had risen from her seat in her agitation, and stood with her back
to the sunlit window, trembling and blushing before her lover.

Launcelot Darrell was not slow to draw a flattering inference from
these signs of womanly confusion.

“You love me, Eleanor,” he said; “yes, you love me. You think, perhaps,
my mother would oppose our marriage. You don’t know me, dearest, if
you can believe I would suffer any opposition to come between me and
my love. I am ready to make any sacrifice for your sake, Eleanor. Only
tell me that you love me, and I shall have a new purpose in life; a new
motive for exertion.”

Mr. Darrell held the girl’s two hands clasped in both his own, as he
pleaded thus, using hackneyed phrases with a vehement earnestness that
gave new life to the old words. His face was close to Eleanor’s, with
the broad light of the sunny summer sky full upon it. Some sudden
fancy—some vague idea, dim and indistinct as the faint memory of a
dream whose details we strive vainly to recall—flashed into the mind
of George Vane’s orphan daughter as she looked into her lover’s black
eyes. She recoiled from him a little; her eyebrows contracted into a
slight frown: her blushes faded out with the effort which she made to
seize upon and analyze that sudden fancy. But her effort was vain:
transient as a gleam of summer lightning the thought had flashed across
her brain, only to melt utterly away.

While she was still trying to recall that lost idea, while Launcelot
Darrell was still pleading for an answer to his suit, the door of
the painting-room was pushed open—it had been left ajar by volatile
Miss Mason, most likely—and the widow entered, pale, stern, and
sorrowful-looking.




CHAPTER XX.

RECOGNITION.


“I thought Laura was with you,” Mrs. Darrell said, rather sharply, as
she scrutinized Eleanor’s face with no very friendly eyes.

“She was with us until a few minutes ago,” Launcelot answered,
carelessly; “but she was called away to see a milliner or a dressmaker,
or some such important personage in the feminine decorative art line.
I don’t believe that young lady’s soul ever soars above laces and
ribbons, and all those miscellaneous fripperies which women dignify by
the generic title of their ‘things!’”

Mrs. Darrell frowned at her son’s contemptuous allusion to the heiress.

“Laura Mason is a very amiable and accomplished girl,” she said.

The young man shrugged his shoulders, and took up his palette and
brushes.

“Will you settle yourself once more in the Rosalind attitude, Miss
Vincent?” he said. “I suppose our volatile Celia will be back
presently.”

“Will you go and look for her, Launcelot?” interposed Mrs. Darrell; “I
want to speak to Miss Vincent.”

Launcelot Darrell flung down his brushes, and turned suddenly towards
his mother with a look of angry defiance in his face.

“What have you to say to Miss Vincent that you can’t say before me?” he
asked. “What do you mean, mother, by breaking in upon us like this, and
scowling at us as if we were a couple of conspirators?”

Mrs. Darrell drew herself to her fullest height, and looked half
sternly, half contemptuously at her son. His nature, in every quality
weaker and meaner than her own, prompted him to shrink from any
open contest with her. Dearly as she loved this selfish, handsome
scapegrace, there were times in which her better sense revolted against
the weakness of her affection; and at such times Launcelot Darrell was
afraid of his mother.

“I have a great deal to say to Miss Vincent,” the widow answered,
gravely. “If you refuse to leave us together, I have no doubt Miss
Vincent will have the good taste to come elsewhere with me.”

Eleanor looked up, startled by the suppressed passion in the widow’s
tone.

“I will come with you anywhere, Mrs. Darrell,” she said, “if you wish
to speak to me.”

“Come this way, then.”

Mrs. Darrell swept out of the room, and Eleanor followed her, before
the young man had any opportunity for remonstrance. The widow led the
way to the pretty chamber in which Miss Vane slept, and the two women
went in together, Mrs. Darrell shutting the door behind her.

“Miss Vincent,” she said, taking Eleanor’s hand in her own, “I am
going to appeal to you more frankly than one woman often appeals to
another. I might diplomatize and plot against you, but I am not base
enough for that; though, I dare say, I could stoop to a good deal that
is despicable for the sake of my son. And, again, I have so good an
opinion of you that I think candour will be the wiser policy. My son
has asked you to be his wife.”

“Madam,” stammered Eleanor, looking aghast at the pale face, which had
an almost tragic aspect in its earnestness.

“Yes, I told you just now that I could do despicable things for my
son’s sake. I was passing the door while Launcelot was talking to you.
The door was ajar, you know. I heard a few words, enough to tell me
the subject upon which he was speaking; and I stopped to hear more. I
listened, Miss Vincent. It was very contemptible, was it not?”

Eleanor was silent. She stood before the widow, looking down upon the
ground. The colour came and went in her face; she was agitated and
confused by what had happened; but in all her agitation and confusion
the memory of that sudden fancy that had flashed across her brain while
Launcelot Darrell talked to her was uppermost in her mind.

“You despise me for my conduct, Miss Vincent,” said Mrs. Darrell,
reading the meaning of the girl’s silence; “but the day may come in
which you may experience a mother’s anguish; the brooding care, the
unceasing watchfulness, the feverish, all-devouring anxiety which only
a mother can feel. If that day ever comes, you will be able to forgive
me; to think mercifully of me. I do not complain of my son; I never
have complained of him. But I suffer; I suffer. I see him holding no
place in the world, despised by prosperous and successful men, with a
wasted youth behind him and a blank future before. I love him; but I am
not deceived in him. The day for all deception is past. He will never
be rich or prosperous by any act of his own. There are but two chances
for him: the chance of inheriting my uncle’s fortune, or the chance of
marrying a rich woman. I speak very frankly, you see, Miss Vincent, and
I expect equal candour from you. Do you love my son?”

“Madam—Mrs. Darrell—I——”

“You would not answer him just now; I ask you to answer me. The
prosperity of his future life hangs upon your reply. I know that he
_might_ marry a girl who does love him; and who can bring him a fortune
which will place him in the position he ought to occupy. Be generous,
Miss Vincent. I ask you to tell me the truth. That is the least you can
do. Do you love my son, Launcelot Darrell? Do you love him with your
whole heart and soul, as I love him?”

Eleanor lifted her head suddenly, and looked full in the widow’s face.

“No, madam,” she answered, proudly, “I do not.”

“Thank God for that! Even if you had loved him, I would not have shrunk
from asking you to sacrifice yourself for his happiness. As it is, I
appeal to you without hesitation. Will you leave this place; will you
leave me my son, with the chance of planning his future after my own
fashion?”

“I will, Mrs. Darrell,” Eleanor said, earnestly. “I thought, perhaps,
till to-day—I may have fancied that I—I mean that I was flattered by
your son’s attention, and perhaps believed I loved him a little,”
the girl murmured, shyly; “but I know now that I have been mistaken.
Perhaps it is the truth and intensity of your love that shows me
the shallowness and falsehood of my own. I remember how I loved my
father,”—her eyes filled with tears as she spoke,—“and, looking back at
my feelings for him, I know that I do not love Mr. Darrell. It will be
much better for me to go away. I shall be sorry to leave Laura—sorry to
leave Hazlewood; for I have been very happy here—too happy perhaps. I
will write to your son, and tell him that I leave this place of my own
free will.”

“Thank you, my dear,” the widow said, warmly; “my son would be very
hard with me if he thought that my influence had been the means of
thwarting any whim of his. I know him well enough to know that this
sentiment, like every other sentiment of his, will not endure for ever.
He will be angry, and offended, and wounded by your departure; but he
will not break his heart, Miss Vincent.”

“Let me go away at once, Mrs. Darrell,” said Eleanor; “it will be
better for me to go at once. I can return to my friends in London. I
have saved some money while I have been with you, and I shall not go
back to them penniless.”

“You are a generous and noble-hearted girl! It shall be my care to
provide you with at least as good a home as you have had here. I am not
selfish enough to forget how much I have asked of you.”

“And you will let me go at once. I would rather not see Laura, or say
good-bye to her; we have grown so fond of each other. I never had a
sister—at least never an affectionate sister—and Laura has been like
one to me. Let me go away quietly without seeing her, Mrs. Darrell; I
can write to her from London to say good-bye.”

“You shall do just as you like, my dear,” the widow answered. “I will
drive you over to Windsor in time for the four o’clock train, and you
will get into town before dark. I must go now and see what my son is
doing. If he should suspect——”

“He shall suspect nothing till I am gone,” said Eleanor. “It is past
one o’clock now, Mrs. Darrell, and I must pack all my things. Will you
keep Laura out of my room, please, for if she came here, she’d guess——?”

“Yes, yes, I’ll go and see—I’ll make all arrangements.”

Mrs. Darrell hurried out of the room, leaving Eleanor to contemplate
the sudden change in her position. The girl dragged one of her trunks
out of a recess in the simply-furnished bedchamber, and, sitting down
upon it in a half-despondent attitude, reflected on the unlooked-for
break in her existence. Once more she was called upon to disunite
herself from the past, and begin life anew.

“Am I never to know any rest?” she thought. “I had grown so accustomed
to this place. I shall be glad to see the Signora and Richard once
more; but Laura, Mr. Monckton,—I wonder whether they will be sorry to
lose me?”

       *       *       *       *       *

By three o’clock in the afternoon all Eleanor’s preparations were
completed—her trunks packed, and handed over to the factotum of the
Hazlewood establishment, who was to see them safely despatched by
luggage-train after the young lady’s departure. At three o’clock
precisely Miss Vincent took her seat beside Mrs. Darrell in the low
basket-carriage.

Circumstances had conspired to favour the girl’s unnoticed departure
from Hazlewood. Laura Mason had been prostrated by the intense strain
upon her faculties caused by an hour’s interview with her dressmaker,
and had flung herself upon the sofa in the drawing-room, after sopping
up half a pint of eau-de-cologne on her flimsy handkerchief. Worn out
by her exertions, and lulled by the summer heat, the young lady had
fallen into a heavy slumber of two or three hours’ duration.

Launcelot Darrell had left the house almost immediately after the scene
in the painting-room, striding out of the hall without leaving any
intimation as to the direction in which he was going or the probable
hour of his return.

Thus it was that the little pony-carriage drove quietly away from the
gates of Hazlewood; and Eleanor left the house in which she had lived
for upwards of a year without any one caring to question her as to the
cause of her departure.

Very few words were said by either Mrs. Darrell or her companion during
the drive to Windsor. Eleanor was absorbed in gloomy thought. She did
not feel any intense grief at leaving Hazlewood; but some sense of
desolation, some despondency, at the thought that she was a wanderer
on the face of the earth, with no real claim upon any one, no actual
right to rest anywhere. They drove into Windsor while she was thinking
thus. They had come through the park, and they entered the town by the
gateway at the bottom of the hill. They had driven up the hill, and
were in the principal street below the castle wall, when Mrs. Darrell
uttered an exclamation of surprise.

“Launcelot!” she said; “and we must pass him to get to the station.
There’s no help for it.”

Eleanor looked up. Yes, before the door of one of the principal hotels
stood Mr. Launcelot Darrell, with two other young men. One of these
men was talking to him, but he was paying very little attention. He
stood upon the edge of the kerbstone, with his back half turned to his
companion, kicking the pebbles on the road with the toe of his boot,
and staring moodily before him.

In that one moment,—in the moment in which the pony-carriage, going at
full speed, passed the young man,—the thought which had flashed, so
vague and indistinct, so transient and intangible, through the mind of
Eleanor Vane that morning, took a new shape, and arose palpable and
vivid in her brain.

This man, Launcelot Darrell, was the sulky stranger who had stood on
the Parisian boulevard, kicking the straws upon the kerbstone, and
waiting to entrap her father to his ruin.




CHAPTER XXI.

ON THE TRACK.


The little pony-carriage drove on to the station; and Eleanor, like
some traveller in a dream, saw the castle walls and turrets, the busy
street and hurrying people, spin past her eyes and melt into confusion.
She did not know how she entered the railway station, or how she came
to be walking quietly up and down the platform with Mrs. Darrell. There
was a choking sensation in her dry throat, a blinding mist before her
eyes, and a confusion that was almost terrible to bear in her brain.
She wanted to get away—anywhere, so long as it was away from all the
world. In the meantime she walked up and down the platform, with
Launcelot Darrell’s mother by her side.

“I am mad,” she thought, “I am mad! It _cannot_ be so!”

Again and again, in the course of Eleanor Vane’s brief association with
the widow’s son, something,—some fancy, some shadowy recollection,
vague and impalpable as the faintest clouds in the summer sky above
Hazlewood—had flitted across her mind, only to be blotted away before
she could even try to define or understand it. But now these passing
fancies all culminated in one conviction. Launcelot Darrell was the man
whom she had seen lounging on the kerbstone of the boulevard on the
night of her last parting with her father.

In vain she reasoned with herself that she had no justifiable grounds
for this conviction—the conviction remained, nevertheless. The only
foundation for her belief that Launcelot Darrell, from amongst all
other men, was the one man whom she sought to pursue, was a resemblance
in his attitude, as he stood lounging in the Windsor street, to the
attitude of the young man on the boulevard. Surely this was the
slightest, the weakest foundation on which belief ever rested! Eleanor
Vane could acknowledge this; but she could not lessen the force of
that belief. At the very moment when the memory of her father and
her father’s death had been farthest from her thoughts, this sudden
conviction, rapid and forcible as inspiration, had flashed upon her.

The matter was beyond reason, beyond argument.

The young man loitering listlessly upon the kerbstone of the Windsor
street was the man who had loitered on the boulevard, waiting, sulkily
enough, while his companion tempted George Vane to his destruction.

It seemed as if the girl’s memory, suddenly endowed with a new and
subtle power, took her back to that August night in the year ’53, and
placed her once more face to face with her father’s enemy. Once more
the dark restless eyes, the pale cowering face and moustachioed lip,
overshadowed by the slouched hat, flashed upon her for a moment, before
the sulky stranger turned away to keep moody silence throughout his
companion’s babble. And with that memory of the past was interlinked
the face and figure of Launcelot Darrell—so closely that, do what she
would, Eleanor Vane could not dissociate the two images.

And she had suffered this man, of all other men, to tell her that he
loved her; she had taken a romantic pleasure in his devotion. Day after
day, and hour after hour, she had been his companion, sharing his
enjoyments, sympathizing with his pursuits, admiring and believing him.
This day—this very day—he had held her hand, he had looked in her face;
and the words she had spoken to Richard Thornton had proved only a vain
boast after all. No instinct in her own breast had revealed to her the
presence of her father’s murderer.

Mrs. Darrell looked furtively every now and then at the girl’s face.
The iron rigidity of that white face almost startled the widow. Was it
the expression of terrible grief restrained by a superhuman effort of
will?

“Does this girl love my son, I wonder?” the widow thought; and then the
answer, prompted by a mother’s pride, came quickly after the question:
“Yes, how could she do otherwise than love him? How could any woman on
earth be indifferent to my boy?”

Something almost akin to pity stirred faintly in the heart which was so
cold to every creature upon earth except this spoiled and prodigal son;
and Mrs. Darrell did her best to comfort the banished girl.

“I am afraid you are ill, my dear Miss Vincent,” the widow said. “The
excitement of this sudden departure has been too much for you. Pray, my
dear, do not think that I submit to this necessity without very great
regret. You have given me perfect satisfaction in everything you have
done ever since you entered my house. No praises I can bestow upon you
in recommending you to a new home will go beyond the truth. Forgive
me! Forgive me, my poor child; I know I must seem very cruel; but I
love my son so dearly—I love him so dearly!”

There was real feeling in the tone in which these words were spoken;
but the widow’s voice sounded far away to Eleanor Vane, and the words
had no meaning. The girl turned her stony face towards the speaker, and
made a feeble effort to understand what was said to her; but all power
of comprehension seemed lost in the confusion of her brain.

“I want to get back to London,” she said, “I want to get away from this
place. Will it be long before the train starts, Mrs. Darrell?”

“Not five minutes. I have put up your money in this envelope, my dear—a
quarter’s salary; the quarter began in June, you know, and I have paid
you up to September. I have paid for your ticket also, in order that
your money might not be broken into by that expense. Your luggage will
be sent to you to-morrow. You will get a cab at the station, my dear.
Your friends will be very much surprised to see you, no doubt.”

“My friends!” repeated Eleanor, in an absent tone.

“Yes, the good music-mistress and her son. I have your address, Miss
Vincent, and you may rely on hearing from me in a few days. I shall
take care that you suffer no inconvenience from this sudden change in
all our plans. Good-bye; and God bless you, my dear!”

Eleanor had taken her seat in the carriage by this time, and the train
was about to move. Mrs. Darrell held out her hand; but the girl drew
away from her with a sudden movement of terror. “Oh, please do not
shake hands with me!” she cried. “I am very, very unhappy!”

The train moved away before the widow could reply to this strange
speech; and the last thing that Eleanor saw was the pale face of
Launcelot Darrell’s mother turned towards her with a look of surprise.

“Poor child!” thought Mrs. Darrell, as she walked slowly back to the
station door, before which her pony-carriage waited. “She feels this
very much, but she has acted nobly.”

The widow sighed as she remembered that the worst part of the struggle
was yet to come. She would have her son’s indignation to encounter and
to endure—not the stormy passion of a strong man unfairly separated
from the woman he loves, but the fretful irritation of a spoiled child
who has been robbed of a favourite toy.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was nearly dark when Eleanor Vane reached the Pilasters. She paid
and dismissed the cab in Dudley Street, and made her way on foot under
the familiar archway and into the Colonnade, where the same children
seemed to be playing the same games in the dusky light, the same
horses peering from the stable-doors, the same cabmen drinking at the
old-fashioned public-house at the corner.

The Signora was giving a singing-lesson to a stolid young person, with
a fat face and freckles, who was being prepared for the lyric drama,
and wished to appear at one of the opera-houses as Norma, after a dozen
lessons or so. Eliza Picirillo was trying her hardest to simplify a
difficult passage for this embryo Grisi’s comprehension, when Eleanor
Vane opened the door of the little sitting-room and appeared upon the
threshold.

It would have been natural to the girl to have rushed to the piano and
flung herself into the arms of the Signora at the risk of upsetting the
stolid pupil; and there was something so very unnatural in her manner
as she paused in the open doorway,—something so wan and ghostlike in
her appearance, that Eliza Picirillo rose from her music-stool in
alarm, and stared aghast at this unexpected visitor.

“Eleanor!” she exclaimed, “Eleanor!”

“Yes, dear Signora, it is I! I—I know I have come back very
unexpectedly; I have a great deal to tell you by-and-by. But I am tired
to death. May I sit down, please, while you finish your lesson?”

“_May_ you sit down! My darling Nelly! is that the way you talk in
your old home? My dear, dear child! do you think you can ever come so
unexpectedly as to fail to find a welcome from Eliza Picirillo? Here,
my dear, sit down and make yourself as comfortable as you can until I’m
able to attend to you. Excuse me, Miss Dodson; we’ll go on with the
duet directly.”

The music-mistress wheeled forward an old easy-chair, her own favourite
seat, and Eleanor dropped wearily into it. Signora Picirillo removed
the girl’s bonnet, and tenderly smoothed her tumbled hair; murmuring
expressions of welcome and affection, and whispering a promise that the
lesson should be very soon finished.

She went back to Norma after seeing Eleanor comfortably ensconced
in the arm-chair, and hammered away sturdily and conscientiously
at the “_Deh, Conte_” duet, in which Miss Dodson gave a very mild
interpretation of the Italian composer’s meaning, and sang about
Pollio, her children, and her wrongs, as placidly as if she had been
declaiming her wish to be a butterfly, or a daisy, or any other
sentiment common to English ballad-singers.

But when Miss Dodson had finished singing, and had put on her bonnet
and shawl (which operation occupied a good deal of unnecessary time),
and had rolled up her music, and found her gloves—which had fallen
off the piano and hidden themselves in an obscure and dusty corner
of the room,—and had farther entered into a detailed and intricate
explanation of her engagements and domestic circumstances before making
an appointment for the next lesson, and had been finally hustled out of
the room and lighted down the stairs, and fully instructed as to the
nearest way from the Pilasters to Camden Town, Eliza Picirillo was able
to give her full attention to the pale-faced girl who had returned so
suddenly to her old shelter. The music-mistress was almost frightened
at the expression of Eleanor Vane’s face. She remembered only too well
having seen that look before, upon the September night in Paris, when
the girl of fifteen had sworn to be revenged upon her father’s enemies.

“Nelly, my darling,” she said, seating herself beside Eleanor’s chair,
“how is it that you come home so suddenly? Nothing could be greater
happiness than to have you back, my dear. But I know that something has
happened; I can see it in your face, Nelly. Tell me, my love, what is
it?”

“It is nothing to be sorry about, dear Signora; I have come away
because—because Mrs. Darrell wished it. Her son—her only son—has come
home from India, and she wants him to marry a rich woman, and—and——”

“And he has fallen in love with _you_, eh, Nelly?” asked the Signora.
“Well, I’m not surprised to hear that, my dear; and you are honourable
enough to beat a retreat, and leave the young man free to make a
mercenary marriage at his mother’s bidding. Dear, dear, what strange
things people are ready to do for money now-a-days! I’m sure you’ve
acted very wisely, my darling; so cheer up, and let me see the bright
smile that we’ve been accustomed to. There’s nothing in all this to
make you look so pale, Nelly.”

“Do I look pale?”

“Yes, as pale as a ghost weary with a long night’s wandering. Nelly,
dear,” said the Signora, very gently, “you weren’t in love with this
young man; you didn’t return his affection, did you?”

“In love with him!” cried Eleanor Vane, with a shudder, “oh! no, no.”

“And yet you seem sorry at having left Hazlewood?”

“I am sorry; I—I had many reasons for wishing to stay there.”

“You were attached to your companion, Miss Mason?”

“Yes, I was very much attached to her,” answered Eleanor. “Don’t ask
me any more questions to-night, dear Signora. I’m tired out with
my journey and the excitement of—all—that has happened to-day; I
will explain things more fully to-morrow. I am glad to come back to
you—very, very glad to see you once more, dearest friend; but I had
a strong reason for wishing to stay at Hazlewood,—I have a powerful
motive for wanting to go back there, if I could go back, which I fear
I never can.” The girl stopped abruptly, as if absorbed in her own
thoughts, and almost unconscious of her friend’s presence.

“Well, well, Nelly, I won’t question you any further,” Eliza Picirillo
said, soothingly. “Goodness knows, my dear, I am glad enough to have
you with me, without worrying you about the why and the wherefore. But
I must go and try and get your little room ready again for you, or
perhaps, as it’s late, you’d better sleep with me to-night.”

“If you please, dear Signora.”

The music-mistress hurried away to make some preparations in the
bedchamber adjoining the little sitting-room; and Eleanor Vane sat
staring at the guttering tallow-candles on the table before her—lost in
the tumult and confusion of her thoughts, which as yet took no distinct
form in her brain.

At the very moment in which she had set a barrier between herself and
Hazlewood that might prevent her ever crossing the threshold of its
gates, she had made a discovery which rendered that retired country
dwelling-house the one spot upon earth to which she had need to have
free access.

“I fancied that I was going away from my revenge when I left London
to go into Berkshire,” she thought; “now I leave my revenge behind me
at Hazlewood. And yet, how can it be as I think? How can it be so?
Launcelot Darrell went to India a year before my father died. Can it be
only a likeness after all—an accidental likeness—between _that man_ and
Mrs. Darrell’s son?”

She sat thinking of these things—reasoning with herself upon the utter
improbability of the identity of the two men, yet yielding again and
again to that conviction which had forced itself upon her, sudden and
irresistible, in the Windsor street,—while the Signora bustled about
between the two rooms, stopping to cast a stolen glance now and then at
Eleanor Vane’s thoughtful face.

Mr. Richard Thornton came in by-and-by. The Phœnix was closed as to
dramatic performances, but the scene-painter’s work never stopped.
The young man gave utterance to a cry of delight as he saw the figure
sitting in his aunt’s easy-chair.

“Nell!” he exclaimed, “has the world come to an end, and have you
dropped into your proper position in the general smash! Eleanor, how
glad I am to see you!”

He held out both his hands. Miss Vane rose and, mechanically, put her
white fingers in the weatherbeaten-looking palms held out to receive
them.

In that moment the scene-painter saw that something had happened.

“What’s the matter, Nell?” he cried, eagerly.

“Hush, Dick,” said the girl in a whisper; “I don’t want the Signora to
know.”

“You don’t want the Signora to know what?”

“I have found that man.”

“What man?”

“The man who caused my father’s death.”




CHAPTER XXII.

IN THE SHIPBROKER’S OFFICE.


Eleanor Vane employed the morning after her arrival at the Pilasters
in writing to Laura Mason. She would have written a long letter if
she could, for she knew what grief her sudden departure must have
caused her childish and confiding companion; but she could not write
of anything except the one thought that absorbed her whole brain,
leaving her for the common business of life a purposeless and powerless
creature. The explanation which she gave of her sudden departure
was lame and laboured; her expressions of regard were trite and
meaningless. It was only when she came to that subject which was the
real purpose of her letter; it was only when she came to write of
Launcelot Darrell that there was any vigour or reality in her words.

“I have a favour to ask you, dear Laura,” she wrote; “and I must beg
you to use your best discretion in granting it. I want you to find
out for me the date of Mr. Darrell’s departure for Calcutta, and the
name of the vessel in which he sailed. Do this, Laura, and you will be
serving me—perhaps serving him also.”

“If I find that he really was in India at the date of my father’s
death,” Eleanor thought, “I _must_ cease to suspect him.”

Later in the day, Miss Vane went out with Richard into the streets and
squares in which all their secret conferences had taken place. She told
the scene-painter very simply and briefly of what had happened, and
poor Dick listened to her story with a tender respect, as he would have
listened to anything from her. But he shook his head with a sad smile
when she had finished.

“What do you think now, Richard?” she asked.

“I think that you are the dupe of a foolish fancy, Nelly,” the young
man answered. “You are deceived by some chance resemblance between this
Mr. Darrell and the man you saw upon the boulevard. Any dark pale-faced
man lounging moodily on a kerbstone would have reminded you of the
figure which is so interwoven with the memories of that mournful time
in Paris. Forget it, Nelly, my dear—forget that dark chapter in the
history of your girlhood. Your father’s rest will be none the sweeter
because the brightness of your youth is blighted by these bitter
memories. Do your duty, Eleanor, in the state to which you are called.
You are _not_ called upon to sacrifice the fairest years of your life
to a Quixotic scheme of vengeance.”

“Quixotic!” cried Eleanor, reproachfully; “you would not speak like
this, Richard, if _your_ father had suffered as my father suffered
through the villany of a gambler and cheat. It is no use talking to me,
Dick,” she added, resolutely. “If this conviction, which I cannot get
out of my mind, is a false one, its falsehood must be proved. If it is
true—why, then, it will seem to me as if Providence had flung this man
across my pathway, and that I am appointed to bring punishment upon him
for his wickedness.”

“Perhaps, Eleanor, but this Mr. Darrell is _not_ the man.”

“How do you know he is not?”

“Because, according to your own account, Launcelot was in India in the
year ’53.”

“Yes, they _say_ that he was there.”

“Have you any reason to doubt the fact?” asked Richard.

“Yes,” answered Eleanor. “When Mr. Darrell first returned to Hazlewood,
Laura Mason was very anxious to hear all about what she called his
‘adventures’ in India. She asked him a great many questions, and I
remember—I cannot tell you, Dick, how carelessly I listened at the
time, though every word comes back to me now as vividly as if I had
been a prisoner, on trial for my life, listening breathlessly to the
evidence of the witnesses against me—I remember now how obstinately
Launcelot Darrell avoided all Laura’s questions, telling her at last,
almost rudely, to change the subject. The next day Mr. Monckton came
to us, and he talked about India; and Mr. Darrell again avoided the
question in the same sullen, disagreeable manner. You may think me weak
and foolish, Richard, and I dare say I am so; but Mr. Monckton is a
very clever man. _He_ could not be easily deceived.”

“But what of him?”

“He said, ‘Launcelot Darrell has a secret; and that secret is connected
with his Indian experiences.’ I thought very little of this at the
time, Dick: but I think I understand it now.”

“Indeed! And the young man’s secret——?”

“Is that he never went to India.”

“Eleanor!”

“Yes, Richard, I think and believe this; and you must help me to find
out whether I am right or wrong.”

The scene-painter sighed. He had hoped that his beautiful adopted
sister had long since abandoned or forgotten her utopian scheme of
vengeance in the congenial society of a gay-hearted girl of her own
age. And behold, here she was, vindictive, resolute, as upon that
Sunday evening, a year and a half ago, on which they had walked
together in those dingy London streets.

Eleanor Vane interpreted her companion’s sigh.

“Remember your promise, Richard.” she said. “You promised to serve me,
and you must do so—you _will_ do so, won’t you, Dick?”

The avenging fury had transformed herself into a siren as she spoke,
and looked archly up at her companion’s face, with her head on one
side, and a soft light in her grey eyes.

“You won’t refuse to serve me, will you, Richard?”

“Refuse!” cried the young man. “Oh! Nelly, Nelly, you know very well
there is nothing in the world I could refuse you.”

Miss Vane accepted this assurance with great composure. She had never
been able to dissociate Richard Thornton with those early days in which
she had accompanied him to Covent Garden to buy mulberry leaves for his
silkworms, and had learned to play “God save the Queen” upon the young
musician’s violin. Nothing was farther from her thoughts than the idea
that poor Dick’s feelings could have undergone any change since those
childish days in the King’s Road, Chelsea.

The letter which Eleanor so feverishly awaited from Laura Mason came
by return of post. The young lady’s epistle was very long, and rather
rambling in its nature. Three sheets of note-paper were covered with
Miss Mason’s lamentations for her Eleanor’s absence, reproachful
complainings against her cruelty, and repeated entreaties that she
would come back to Hazlewood.

George Vane’s daughter did not linger over this feminine missive. A few
days ago she would have been touched by Laura’s innocent expressions
of regard; now her eyes hurried along the lines, taking little note of
all those simple words of affection and regret, and looking greedily
forward to that one only passage in the letter which was likely to have
any interest for her.

This passage did not occur until Eleanor had reached the very last of
the twelve pages which Miss Mason had covered with flowing Italian
characters, whose symmetry was here and there disfigured by sundry
blots and erasures. But as her eyes rested upon the last page, Eleanor
Vane’s hand tightened upon the paper in her grasp, and the hot blood
rushed redly to her earnest face.

“And I have found out all you want to know, dear Nell,” wrote Miss
Mason; “though I am puzzled out of my wits to know why you should want
to know it—when I did exercises in composition at Bayswater, they
wouldn’t let me put two ‘knows’ so near together; but you won’t mind
it, will you, dear? Well, darling, I’m not very clever at beating about
the bush or finding out anything in a diplomatic way; so this afternoon
at tea—I am writing to catch the evening post, and Bob is going to take
my letters to the village for sixpence—I asked Launcelot Darrell, who
was not drinking his tea, like a Christian, but lolling in the window,
smoking a cigar: he has been as sulky as a bear ever since you left—oh,
Nelly, Nelly, he isn’t in love with you, is he?—I should break my heart
if I thought he was—I asked him, point-blank, what year and what day he
sailed for India. I suppose the question sounded rather impertinent,
for he coloured up scarlet all in a minute, and shrugged his shoulders
in that dear disdainful way of his that always reminds me of Lara
or the Corsair—L. and the C. were the same person, though, weren’t
they?—and said, ‘I don’t keep a diary, Miss Mason, or I should be happy
to afford you any information you may require as to my antecedents.’ I
thought I should have dropped through the floor, Nelly,—the floor won’t
let one drop through it, or else I am sure I should,—and I couldn’t
have asked another question, even for your sake, dear; when, strange
to say, Mrs. Darrell got me quite out of the difficulty. ‘I am sorry
you should answer Laura so very unkindly, Launcelot,’ she said; ‘there
is nothing strange in her question. _I_ remember the date of your
departure from your native country only too vividly. You left this
house upon the 3rd of October, ’52, and you were to sail from Gravesend
on the 4th, in the _Princess Alice_. I have reason to remember the
date, for it seemed as if my uncle chose the very worst season of the
year for sending you upon a long sea-voyage. But he was prompted, no
doubt, by my sisters. I ought to feel no anger against _him_, poor old
man!’”

Eleanor Vane glanced hurriedly at the concluding words of the letter.
Then, with the last sheet crumpled in her hand, she sat motionless and
absorbed, thinking over its contents.

“If Launcelot Darrell sailed for India upon the 4th of October, ’52,
he is not likely to have been in Paris in ’53. If I can only prove to
myself that he did sail upon that date, I will try and believe that I
have been deluded by some foolish fancy of my own. But why did his face
flush scarlet when Laura questioned him about his voyage?—why did he
pretend to have forgotten the date?”

Eleanor waited impatiently for the arrival of her friend and
counsellor, Richard Thornton. He came in at about three o’clock in the
afternoon, while his aunt was still absent amongst her out-of-door
pupils, and flung himself, jaded and worn out, on the chintz-covered
sofa. But, tired as he was, he aroused himself by an effort to listen
to that portion of Laura Mason’s letter which related to Launcelot
Darrell.

“What do you think now, Dick?” Miss Vane asked, when she had finished
reading.

“Pretty much what I thought before, Nell,” answered Mr. Thornton.
“This young fellow’s objection to talk of his Indian voyage is no
proof that he never went upon that voyage. He may have half-a-dozen
unpleasant recollections connected with that part of his life. I don’t
particularly care about talking of the Phœnix; but I never committed a
murder in the obscurity of the flies, or buried the body of my victim
between the stage and the mezzanine floor. People have their secrets,
Nell; and we have no right to pry into the small mysteries which may
lurk under a change of countenance or an impatient word.”

Eleanor Vane took very little notice of the young man’s argument.

“Can you find out if Launcelot Darrell sailed in the _Princess Alice_,
Dick?” she added.

The scene-painter rubbed his chin reflectively.

“I can _try_ and find out, my dear,” he said, after a pause, “that’s
open to anybody. The _Princess Alice_! She’s one of Ward’s ships, I
think. If the shipbrokers are inclined to be civil, they’ll perhaps
help me; but I have no justification for bothering them upon the
subject, and they _may_ tell me to go about my business. If I could
give them a good reason for my making such an inquiry, I might very
likely find them willing to help me. But what can I tell them—except
that a very beautiful young person with grey eyes and auburn hair has
taken an absurd crotchet into her obstinate head, and that I, her
faithful slave, am compelled to do her bidding?”

“Never mind what they say to you, Richard,” Miss Vane replied,
authoritatively; “they _must_ answer your question if you only go on
asking them long enough.”

Mr. Thornton smiled.

“That’s the true feminine method of obtaining information; isn’t it,
Nell?” he said. “However, I’ll do my best: and if the shipbrokers are
to be ‘got at,’ as sporting gentlemen say, it shall go hard if I don’t
get a list of the passengers who sailed in the _Princess Alice_.”

“Dear, dear Dick!” cried Eleanor, holding out both her hands to her
champion. The young man sighed. Alas! he knew only too well that all
this pretty friendliness was as far away from any latent tenderness
or hidden emotion as the blusterous frozen North is from the splendid
sunny South.

“I wonder whether she knows what love is,” thought the scene-painter;
“I wonder whether her heart has been touched ever so slightly by the
fatal emotion. No; she is a bright virginal creature, all confidence
and candour, and she has yet to learn the mysteries of life. I wish I
could think less of her; and fall in love with Miss Montalembert—her
name is plain Lambert, and she has added the Monta for the sake of
euphony. I wish I could fall in love with Lizzie Lambert, popularly
known as Elise Montalembert, the soubrette at the Phœnix. She is a
good little girl, and earns a salary of four pounds a week. She’s
fond of the Signora, too, and we could leave the Pilasters and go into
housekeeping upon our joint salaries.”

Mr. Thornton’s fancies might have rambled on in this wise for some
time, but he was abruptly aroused from his reverie by Eleanor Vane, who
had been watching him rather impatiently.

“When are you going to the shipbroker’s, Dick?” she asked.

“When am I going?”

“Yes; you’ll go at once, won’t you?”

“Eh! Well, my dear Nell, Cornhill’s a good step from here.”

“But you can take a cab,” cried the young lady. “I’ve plenty of money,
Dick, and do you think I shall grudge it for such a purpose? Go at
once, Richard, dear, and take a cab.”

She pulled a purse from her pocket, and tried to force it into the
young man’s hand; but he shook his head.

“I’m afraid the shipbroker’s office would be closed, Nelly,” he said.
“We’d better wait till to-morrow morning.”

But the young lady would not hear of this. She was sure the
shipbroker’s office wouldn’t close so early, she said, with as much
authority as if she had been intimately acquainted with the habits of
shipbrokers; and she bustled Dick down stairs and out of the house
before he well knew where he was.

He returned in about an hour and a half, very tired and dusty; having
preferred his independence and an omnibus to the cab offered by Eleanor.

“It’s no use, Nelly,” he said despondently, as he threw off his hat,
and ran his dirty fingers through the rumpled shock of dusty brown hair
that had been blown about his face by the hot August wind, “the office
was just closing, and I couldn’t get anything out of the clerks. I was
never so cruelly snubbed in my life.”

Miss Vane looked very much disappointed, and was silent for a minute
or so. Then her face suddenly brightened, and she patted Richard’s
shoulder with a gesture expressive of patronage and encouragement.

“Never mind, Dick,” she said, smilingly, “you shall go again to-morrow
morning early; and I’ll go with you. We’ll see if these shipbroker’s
clerks will snub _me_!”

“Snub you!” cried Richard Thornton, in a rapture of admiration. “I
think that, of all the members of the human family, paid officials are
the most unpleasant and repulsive; but I don’t think there’s a clerk in
Christendom who could snub you, Miss Vane.”

Eleanor smiled. Perhaps for the first time in her life the young lady
was guilty of a spice of that feminine sin called coquetry. Her boxes
had arrived from Hazlewood upon the previous evening. She was armed,
therefore, with all those munitions of war without which a woman can
scarcely commence a siege upon the fortress of man’s indifference.

She rose early the next morning—for she was too much absorbed in the
one great purpose of her life to be able to sleep very long or very
soundly—and arrayed herself for a visit to the shipbroker.

She put on a bonnet of pale blue crape, which was to be the chief
instrument in the siege—a feminine battering-ram or Armstrong gun
before which the stoutest wall must have crumbled—and smoothed her
silken locks, her soft amber-dropping tresses, under this framework of
diaphanous azure. Then she went into the little sitting-room where Mr.
Richard Thornton was loitering over his breakfast, to try the effect of
this piece of milliner’s artillery upon the unhappy young man.

“Will the clerks snub me, Dick?” she asked, archly.

The scene-painter replied with his mouth full of egg and
bread-and-butter, and was more enthusiastic than intelligible.

A four-wheel cab jolted Miss Vane and her companion to Cornhill, and
the young lady contrived to make her way into the sanctum-sanctorum
of the shipbroker himself, in a manner which took Richard Thornton’s
breath away from him, in the fervour of his admiration. Every barrier
gave way before the blue bonnet and glistening auburn hair, the bright
grey eyes and friendly smile. Poor Dick had approached the officials
with that air of suppressed enmity and lurking hate with which the
Englishman generally addresses his brother Englishman; but Eleanor’s
friendliness and familiarity disarmed the stoniest of the clerks, and
she was conducted to the shipbroker’s private room by an usher who
bowed before her as if she had been a queen.

The young lady told her story very simply, She wished to ascertain if a
gentleman called Launcelot Darrell had sailed in the _Princess Alice_
on the 4th of October, ’52.

This was all she said. Richard Thornton stood by, fingering difficult
passages in his last overture on the brim of his hat, out of sheer
perturbation of spirit, while he wondered at and admired Miss Vane’s
placid assurance.

“I shall be extremely obliged if you can give me this information,” she
said in conclusion, “for a great deal depends upon my being able to
ascertain the truth in this matter.”

The shipbroker looked through his spectacles at the earnest face turned
so trustingly towards his own. He was an old man, with granddaughters
as tall as Eleanor, but was nevertheless not utterly dead to the
influence of a beautiful face. The auburn hair and diaphanous bonnet
made a bright spot of colour in the dinginess of his dusty office.

“I should be very ungallant were I to refuse to serve a young lady,”
the old man said, politely.—“Jarvis,” he added, turning to the clerk
who had conducted Eleanor to his apartment, “do you think you could
contrive to look up the list of passengers in the _Princess Alice_,
October 4, ’52?”

Mr. Jarvis, who had told Richard to go about his business upon the day
before, said he had no doubt he could, and went away to perform this
errand.

Eleanor’s breath grew short and quick, and her colour rose as she
waited for the clerk’s return. Richard executed impossible passages on
the brim of his hat. The shipbroker watched the girl’s face, and drew
his own deductions from the flutter of agitation visible in that bright
countenance.

“Aha!” he thought, “a love affair, no doubt. This pretty girl in the
blue bonnet has come here to look after a runaway sweetheart.”

The clerk returned, carrying a ledger, with his thumb between two of
the leaves. He opened the uninteresting-looking volume, and laid it on
the table before his employer, pointing with his spare forefinger to
one particular entry.

“A berth was taken for a Mr. Launcelot Darrell, who was to share his
cabin with a Mr. Thomas Halliday,” the shipbroker said, looking at the
passage to which the clerk pointed.

Eleanor’s face crimsoned. She had wronged the widow’s son, then, after
all.

“But the name was crossed out afterwards,” continued the old man, “and
there’s another entry farther down, dated October 5th. The ship sailed
without Mr. Darrell.”

The crimson flush faded out of Eleanor’s face and left it deadly pale.
She tottered a few paces towards the table, with her hand stretched
out, as if she would have taken the book from the shipbroker and
examined the entry for herself. But midway between the chair she had
left and the table, her strength failed her, and she would have fallen
if Richard Thornton had not dashed his hat upon the ground, and caught
her sinking figure in his outstretched arms.

“Dear me!” exclaimed the shipbroker, “bless my soul: a glass of water,
Jarvis; this is very sad, very sad, indeed. A runaway lover, I suppose,
or a brother, perhaps. These sort of things are always happening. I
assure you, if I had the gift that some of you young people have, I
could write half-a-dozen romances out of the history of this office.”

The clerk came back with the glass of water; it was rather a
murky-looking fluid, but a few drops between Eleanor’s pale lips served
to bring the life back to her.

She lifted her head with the proud resolution of a queen, and looked
at the compassionate shipbroker with a strange smile. She had heard
the old man’s suppositions about lovers and brothers. How far away his
simple fancy led him from the bitter truth!

She held out her hand to him as she rose from her chair, erect and
dauntless as a fair-haired Joan of Arc, ready to gird on the sword in
defence of her king and country.

“I thank you very much, sir,” she said, “for what you have done for me
to-day. My father was an old man—as old or older perhaps than yourself;
and he died a very cruel death. I believe that your kindness of this
day will help me to avenge him.”




CHAPTER XXIII

RESOLVED.


Launcelot Darrell had not sailed for Calcutta in the _Princess Alice_.
This point once established, it was utterly vain for Richard Thornton
to argue against that indomitable belief which had taken possession of
Eleanor Vane’s mind, respecting the identity between the man who had
won her father’s money at écarté, and Mrs. Darrell’s only son.

“I tell you, Richard,” she said, when the scene-painter argued with
her, “that nothing but proof positive of Launcelot Darrell’s absence
in India at the date of my father’s death would have dispossessed me
of the idea that flashed upon me on the day I left Berkshire. He was
not in India at that time. He deceived his mother and his friends. He
remained in Europe; and led, no doubt, an idle, dissipated life. He
must have lived by his wits, for he had no money from his mother—no
one to help him—no profession to support him. What is more likely
than that he went to Paris,—the paradise of scoundrels, I have heard
you say, Richard,—under an assumed name? What more likely? Why, _he
was there_! The man I saw on the boulevard, and the man I saw in the
Windsor street, are one and the same. You cannot argue me out of that
conviction, Richard Thornton, for it is the truth. It is the truth, and
it shall be the business of my life to prove that it is so.”

“And what then, Eleanor?” Mr. Thornton asked, gravely. “Supposing
you can prove this; by such evidences as will be very difficult to
get at—by such an investigation as will waste your life, blight your
girlhood, warp your nature, unsex your mind, and transform you from a
candid and confiding woman into an amateur detective. Suppose you do
all this,—and you little guess, my dear, the humiliating falsehoods,
the pitiful deceptions, the studied basenesses, you must practise
if you are to tread that sinuous pathway,—what then? What good is
effected; what end is gained? Are you any nearer to the accomplishment
of the vow you uttered in the Rue de l’Archevêque?”

“What do you mean, Richard?”

“I mean that to prove this man’s guilt is not to avenge your father’s
death. Neither you nor the law has any power to punish him. He may or
may not have cheated your poor father. At this distance of time you can
prove nothing; except that he played écarté in the private room of a
café, and that he won all your father’s money. He would only laugh in
your face, my poor Nelly, if you were to bring such a charge as this
against him.”

“If I can once prove that, which I now believe as firmly as if every
mortal proof had demonstrated its truth, I know how to punish Launcelot
Darrell,” replied the girl.

“You know how to punish him?”

“Yes. His uncle—that is to say, his great-uncle—Maurice de Crespigny,
was my father’s firmest friend. I need not tell you that story, Dick,
for you have heard it often enough from my poor father’s own lips.
Launcelot Darrell hopes to inherit the old man’s money, and is, I
believe, likely enough to do so. But if I could prove to the old
man that my father died a melancholy and untimely death through his
nephew’s treachery, Launcelot Darrell would never receive a sixpence
of that money. I know how eagerly he looks forward to it, though he
affects indifference.”

“And you would do this, Eleanor?” asked Richard, staring aghast at his
companion. “You would betray the secrets of this young man’s youth to
his uncle, and compass his ruin by that revelation?”

“I would do what I swore to do in the Rue de l’Archevêque—I would
avenge my father’s death. The last words my poor father ever wrote
appealed to me to do that. I have never forgotten those words. There
may have been a deeper treachery in that night’s work than you or I
knew of, Richard. Launcelot Darrell knew who my father was; he knew
of the friendship between him and Mr. de Crespigny. How do we know
that he did not try to goad the poor old man to that last act of his
despair?—how do we know that he did not plan those losses at cards, in
order to remove his uncle’s friend from his pathway? O God! Richard, if
I thought that——!”

The girl rose from her chair in a sudden tumult of passion, with her
hands clenched and her eyes flashing.

“If I could think that his treachery went beyond the baseness of
cheating my father of his money for the money’s sake, I would take
_his_ life for that dear life as freely and as unhesitatingly as I lift
my hand up now.”

She raised her clenched hand towards the ceiling as she spoke, as
if to register some unuttered vow. Then, turning abruptly to the
scene-painter, she said, almost imploringly,——

“It can’t be, Richard; he cannot have been so base as that! He held my
hand in his only a few days ago. I would cut off that hand if I could
think that Launcelot Darrell had planned my father’s death.”

“But you cannot think it, my dear Eleanor,” Richard answered,
earnestly. “How should the young man know that your father would take
his loss so deeply to heart? We none of us calculate the consequences
of our sins, my dear. If this man cheated, he cheated because he wanted
money. For Heaven’s sake, Nelly, leave him and his sin in the hands of
Providence! The future is not a blank sheet of paper, for us to write
any story we please upon, but a wonderful chart, mapped out by a Divine
and unerring Hand. Launcelot Darrell will not go unpunished, my dear.
‘My faith is strong in Time,’ as the poet says. Leave the young man to
time—and to Providence.”

Eleanor Vane shook her head, smiling bitterly at her friend’s
philosophy. Poor mad Constance’s reply always rose, in some shape
or other, to the girl’s lips in answer to Richard’s arguments. The
Cardinal reasons with wonderful discretion, but the bereaved mother
utters one sentence that is more powerful than all the worthy man’s
moralities: “He talks to me that never had a son!”

“It is no use preaching to me,” Miss Vane said. “If _your_ father had
died by this man’s treachery, you would not feel so charitably disposed
towards him. I _will_ keep the promise made three years ago. I _will_
prove Launcelot Darrell’s guilt; and that guilt shall stand between him
and Maurice de Crespigny’s fortune.”

“You forget one point in this business, Eleanor.”

“What point?”

“It may take you a very long time to obtain the proof you want. Mr.
de Crespigny is an old man and an invalid. He may make a will in Mr.
Darrell’s favour and die before you are in a position to tell him of
his nephew’s treachery to your poor father.”

Eleanor was silent for a few moments. Her arched brows contracted, and
her mouth grew compressed and rigid.

“I must go back to Hazlewood, Dick,” she said, slowly. “Yes, you are
right; there is no time to be lost. I _must_ go back to Hazlewood.”

“That is not very practicable, is it, Nell?”

“I _must_ go back, if I go in some disguise—if I go and hide myself in
the village, and watch Launcelot Darrell when he least thinks he is
observed. I don’t care how I go, Richard, but I must be there. It can
only be from the discoveries I make in the present that I shall be able
to trace my way back to the history of the past. I must go there!”

“And begin at once upon the business of a detective? Eleanor, you shall
not do this, if I can prevent you.”

Richard Thornton’s unavowed love gave him a certain degree of authority
over the impulsive girl. There is always a dignity and power in every
feeling that is really true. Throughout the story of Notre Dame de
Paris, the hunchback’s love for Esmeralda is never once contemptible.
It is only Phœbus, handsome, glittering, and false, who provokes our
scorn.

Eleanor Vane did not rebel against the young man’s tone of authority.

“Oh, Dick, Dick!” she cried, piteously, “I know how wicked I am. I have
been nothing but a trouble to you and the dear Signora. But I cannot
forget my father’s death—I cannot forget the letter he wrote to me. I
must be true to the vow I made then, Richard, if I sacrifice my life in
keeping my word.”

Eliza Picirillo came in before the scene-painter could reply to this
speech. It had been agreed between the two young people that the
Signora should know nothing of Miss Vane’s discoveries; so Eleanor and
Richard saluted the music-mistress in that strain of factitious gaiety
generally adopted under such circumstances.

Signora Picirillo’s perceptions were perhaps a little blunted by the
wear-and-tear of half-a-dozen hours’ labour amongst her out-door
pupils; and as Eleanor bustled about the room preparing the tea-table
and making the tea, the good music-mistress fully believed in her
protégée’s simulated liveliness. When the table had been cleared, and
Richard had gone to smoke his short meerschaum amongst the damp straw
and invalid cabs in the promenade before the Pilasters, Eleanor seated
herself at the piano, in order to escape the necessity of conversation.
Her fingers flew over the keys in a thousand complexities of harmony,
but her mind, for ever true to one idea, brooded upon the dark scheme
of vengeance which she had planned for herself.

“Come what may,” she thought again and again, “at any price I must go
back to Hazlewood.”




CHAPTER XXIV.

THE ONE CHANCE.


Eleanor Vane lay awake through the greater part of the night which
succeeded her interview with the shipbroker. She lay awake, trying
to fashion for herself some scheme by which she might go back to
Hazlewood. The discovery which she had to make, the proof positive
that she wanted to obtain of Launcelot Darrell’s guilt, could only be
procured by long and patient watching of the young man himself; the
evidence that was to condemn him must come from his own lips. Some
chance admission, some accidental word, might afford a clue that would
guide her back to the secret of the past. But to obtain this clue
she must be in intimate association with the man whom she suspected.
In the careless confidence of daily life, in the freedom of social
intercourse, a hundred chances might occur which could never be brought
about while the gates of Hazlewood were closed upon her.

There was one other chance, it was true. Launcelot Darrell had asked
her to become his wife. His love, however feeble to withstand the wear
and tear of time, must, for the moment at least, be real. A line from
her would no doubt bring him to her side. She could lure him on by
affecting to return his affection, and in the entire confidence of such
an association she might discover the truth.

No! not for the wide world—not even to be true to her dead father—could
she be so false to every sentiment of womanly honour!

“Richard was right,” she thought, as she dismissed this idea with a
humiliating sense of her own baseness in having even for one brief
moment entertained it. “He was right. What shame and degradation I must
wade through before I can keep my promise!”

And to keep her promise she must go back to Hazlewood. This was the
point to which she always returned. But was it possible for her to
regain her old position in Mrs. Darrell’s house? Would not Mrs. Darrell
take care to keep her away, having once succeeded in banishing her from
Launcelot’s society?

Miss Vane was not a good schemer. Transparent, ingenuous, and
impulsive, she had the will and the courage which would have prompted
her to denounce Launcelot Darrell as a traitor and a cheat; but she did
not possess one of the attributes which are necessary for the watcher
who hopes to trace a shameful secret through all the dark intricacies
of the hidden pathway that leads to it.

It was long after daylight when the young lady fell asleep, worn out,
harassed, and baffled. The night had brought no counsel. Eleanor Vane
dropped off into a fitful slumber, with a passionate prayer upon her
lips,—a prayer that Providence would set her in the way of bringing
vengeance upon her father’s destroyer.

She flung herself upon Providence—after the manner of a great many
persons—when she found her own intellect powerless to conduct her to
the end she wanted to gain.

Throughout the next day Miss Vane sat alone on the chintz-covered sofa
by the window, looking down at the children playing hop-scotch, and
gambling for marbles upon the rugged flags below; “weary of the rolling
hours,” and unable to bring herself to the frame of mind necessary
for the ordinary purposes of life. Upon any other occasion she would
have tried to do something whereby she might lighten the Signora’s
burden, being quite competent to take the pupils off her friend’s
hands; but to-day she had suffered Eliza Picirillo to trudge out under
the broiling August sky, through the stifling London streets, and had
made no attempt to lessen her labours. She seemed even incapable of
performing the little domestic offices which she had been in the habit
of doing. She let the London dust accumulate upon the piano; she left
the breakfast-table scattered with the débris of the morning’s meal;
she made no effort to collect the stray sheets of music, the open
books, the scraps of needlework that littered the room; but with her
elbow on the smoky sill of the window, and her head resting on her
hand, she sat, looking wearily out, with eyes that saw nothing but
vacancy.

Richard had gone out early, and neither he nor his aunt was expected to
return till dusk.

“I can have everything ready for them when they come back,” she
thought, looking listlessly at the unwashed tea-things, which seemed to
stare at her in mute reproachfulness; and then her eyes wandered back
to the sunny window, and her mind returned with a cruel constancy to
the one idea that occupied it.

Had she been really looking at the objects on which her eyes seemed
to be fixed, she must have been surprised by the advent of a tall
and rather distinguished-looking stranger, who made his way along
the straw-littered promenade, between the Colonnade and the stables,
erasing the chalk diagrams of the hop-scotch players with the soles
of his boots, and rendering himself otherwise objectionable to the
juvenile population.

This stranger came straight to the shop of the shoemaker with whom
Signora Picirillo lodged, and inquired for Miss Vincent.

The shoemaker had only heard Eleanor’s assumed name a day or two
before, when Laura’s letter had arrived at the Pilasters. He had a
vague idea that the beautiful golden-haired young woman, who had first
entered his dwelling in the early freshness of budding girlhood, was
going to distinguish herself as a great musical genius, and intended to
astonish the professional world under a false name.

“It’s Miss Eleanor you want, I suppose, sir?” the man said, in answer
to the stranger’s question.

“Miss Eleanor?—yes.”

“Then, if you’ll please to step up-stairs, sir. The young lady’s all
alone to-day, for Mr. Richard he’s over the water a scene-paintin’ away
for dear life, and the S’nora she’s out givin’ lessons so poor young
miss is alone, and dismal enough she must be, cooped in-doors this fine
weather. It’s bad enough when one’s obliged to it, you know, sir,” the
man added, rather obscurely. “Will you please to walk up, sir? It’s the
door facing you at the top of the stairs.”

The shoemaker opened a half-glass door communicating with a dingy back
parlour and a steep staircase that twisted corkscrew-wise up to the
first floor. The visitor waited for no further invitation, but ascended
the stairs in a few strides, and paused for a moment before the door of
Signora Picirillo’s sitting-room.

“He’s one of these here London managers, I dessay,” thought the simple
cordwainer, as he went back to his work. “Mr. Cromshaw come here one
day after Mr. Richard in a pheeaton and pair, and no end of diamond
rings and breastpins.”

Eleanor Vane had not noticed the stranger’s footsteps on the uncarpeted
stair, but she started when the door opened, and looked round. Her
unexpected visitor was Mr. Monckton.

She rose in confusion, and stood with her back to the window, looking
at the lawyer. She was too much absorbed by her one idea to be troubled
by the untidiness of the shabby chamber, by the disorder of her own
hair or dress, or by any of those external circumstances which are
generally so embarrassing to a woman. She only thought of Gilbert
Monckton as a link between herself and Hazlewood. She did not even
wonder why he had come to see her.

“I may find out something; I may learn something from him,” she thought.

Against the great purpose of her life, even this man, who of all others
she most respected and esteemed, sank into utter insignificance. She
never cared to consider what he might think. She only regarded him as
an instrument which might happen to be of use to her.

“You are very much surprised to see me, Miss Vincent,” the lawyer said,
holding out his hand.

The girl put her hand loosely in his, and Gilbert Monckton started
as he felt the feverish heat of the slim fingers that touched his so
lightly. He looked into Eleanor’s face. The excitement of the last
three days had left its traces on her countenance.

Mrs. Darrell had made a confidant of the lawyer. It had been absolutely
necessary to explain Eleanor’s absence. Mrs. Darrell had given her own
version of the business, telling the truth, with sundry reservations.
Miss Vincent was a handsome and agreeable girl, she said; it was of
vital consequence to Launcelot that he should not form any attachment
or entertain any passing fancy, that might militate against his future
prospects. An imprudent marriage had alienated her, Mrs. Darrell,
from her uncle, Maurice de Crespigny. An imprudent marriage might
ruin the young man’s chance of inheriting the Woodlands estate.
Under these circumstances it was advisable that Miss Vincent should
leave Hazlewood; and the young lady had very generously resigned her
situation upon the matter being put before her in a proper light.

Mrs. Darrell took very good care not to make any allusion to that
declaration of love which she had overheard through the half-open door
of her son’s painting-room.

Mr. Monckton had expressed no little vexation at the sudden departure
of his ward’s companion; but his annoyance was of course felt solely on
account of Miss Mason, who told him, with her eyes streaming, and her
voice half-choked with sobs, that she could never be happy without her
darling Eleanor.

The lawyer said very little in reply to these lamentations, but took
care to get Miss Vincent’s address from his ward, and on the day after
his visit to Hazlewood went straight from his office to the Pilasters.

Looking at the change in Eleanor Vane’s face, Mr. Monckton, began to
wonder very seriously if the departure from Hazlewood had been a matter
of indifference to her; and whether it might not be that Mrs. Darrell’s
alarms about her son’s possible admiration for the penniless companion
were founded on stronger grounds than the widow had cared to reveal to
him.

“I was afraid that Laura’s frivolous fancy might be caught by this
young fellow,” he thought, “but I could never have believed that this
girl, who has ten times Laura’s intellect, would fall in love with
Launcelot Darrell.”

He thought this, while Eleanor’s feverish hand lay, loose and passive,
in his own.

“It was not quite kind of you to leave Hazlewood without seeing me,
or consulting me, Miss Vincent,” he said: “you must remember that I
confided to you a trust.”

“A trust!”

“Yes. You promised that you would look after my foolish young ward, and
take care that she did not fall in love with Mr. Darrell.”

Mr. Monckton watched the girl’s face very closely while he pronounced
Launcelot Darrell’s name, but there was no revelation in that pale
and wearied countenance. The grey eyes returned his gaze frankly and
unhesitatingly. Their brightness was faded, but their innocent candour
remained, in all its virginal beauty.

“I tried to do what you wished,” Miss Vane answered. “I am afraid that
Laura does admire Mr. Darrell. But I can’t quite understand whether she
is serious or not, and in any case nothing I could say would influence
her much, though I know she loves me.”

“No, I suppose not,” said Mr. Monckton, rather bitterly; “women are
not easily to be influenced in these matters. A woman’s love is the
sublimation of selfishness, Miss Vincent. It is delightful to a woman
to throw herself away; and she is perfectly indifferent as to how many
unoffending victims she drags to destruction in her downfall. An Indian
woman sacrifices herself out of respect to her dead husband. An English
woman offers up her husband and children on the altar of a living
lover. Pardon me if I speak too plainly. We lawyers become acquainted
with strange stories. I should not at all wonder if my ward were to
insist upon making herself miserable for life because Launcelot Darrell
has a Grecian nose.”

Mr. Monckton seated himself, uninvited, by the table on which the
unwashed tea-things bore testimonies to Eleanor’s neglect. He looked
round the room, but not rudely; for in one brief observant glance he
was able to see everything, and to understand everything.

“Have you ever _lived_ here, Miss Vincent?” he asked.

“Yes; I lived here a year and a half before I went to Hazlewood. I
was very happy,” Eleanor added, hastily, as if in deprecation of the
lawyer’s look, which betrayed a half-compassionate interest. “My
friends are very good to me, and I never wish for a better home.”

“But you have been accustomed to a better home, in your childhood?”

“No, not very much better. I always lived in lodgings, with my poor
father.”

“Your father was not rich, then?”

“No, not at all rich.”

“He was a professional man, I suppose?”

“No, he had no profession. He had been rich—very rich—once.”

The colour rose to Eleanor’s face as she spoke, for she suddenly
recollected that she had a secret to keep. The lawyer might recognize
George Vane by this description, she thought.

Gilbert Monckton fancied that sudden blush arose from wounded pride.

“Forgive me for asking you so many questions, Miss Vincent,” he said,
gently. “I am very much interested in you. I have been very much
interested in you for a long time.”

He was silent for some minutes. Eleanor had resumed her seat near the
window, and sat in a thoughtful attitude, with her eyes cast upon
the ground. She was wondering how she was to make good use of this
interview, and discover as much as possible of Launcelot Darrell’s
antecedents.

“Will you forgive me if I ask you a few more questions, Miss Vincent?”
the lawyer asked, after this brief silence.

Eleanor raised her eyes, and looked him full in the face. That bright,
straight, unfaltering gaze was perhaps the greatest charm which Miss
Vane possessed. She had no reason to complain that Nature had gifted
her with a niggardly hand; she had beauty of feature, of outline, of
colour; but this exquisitely candid expression was a rarer beauty, and
a higher gift.

“Believe me,” said Mr. Monckton, “that I am actuated by no unworthy
motive when I ask you to deal frankly with me. You will understand,
by-and-by, why and by what right I presume to question you. In the
meantime I ask you to confide in me. You left Hazlewood at Mrs.
Darrell’s wish, did you not?”

“Yes: it was at her wish that I left.”

“Her son had made you an offer of his hand?”

The question would have brought a blush to the face of an ordinary
girl. But Eleanor Vane was removed from ordinary women by the
exceptional story of her life. From the moment of her discovery of
Launcelot Darrell’s identity, all thought of him as a lover, or an
admirer, had been blotted out of her mind. He was removed from other
men by the circumstances of his guilt; as she was set apart from other
women by the revengeful purpose in her breast.

“Yes,” she said. “Mr. Darrell asked me to be his wife.”

“And did you—did you refuse him?”

“No; I gave him no answer.”

“You did not love him, then?”

“Love him! Oh, no, no!”

Her eyes dilated with a look of surprise as she spoke, as if it was
most astounding to her that Gilbert Monckton should ask such a question.

“Perhaps you do not think Launcelot Darrell worthy of a good woman’s
love?”

“I do not,” answered Eleanor. “Don’t talk of him, please. At least, I
mean, don’t talk of him, and of love,” she added, hastily, remembering
that the very thing she wished was that the lawyer should talk of
Launcelot Darrell. “You—you must know a great deal of his youth. He was
idle and dissipated, was he not; and—and—a card-player?”

“A card-player?”

“Yes—a gambler; a man who plays cards for the sake of winning money?”

“I never heard any one say so. He was idle, no doubt, and loitered away
his time in London under the pretence of studying art; but I never
remember hearing that gambling was one of his vices. However, I don’t
come here to speak of him, but of you. What are you going to do, now
that you have left Hazlewood?”

Eleanor was cruelly embarrassed by this question. Her most earnest
wish was to return to Hazlewood, or at least to the neighbourhood of
Launcelot Darrell’s home. Absorbed by this wish, she had formed no
scheme for the future. She had not even remembered that she stood alone
in the world, with only a few pounds saved out of her slender salary,
unprovided with that which is the most necessary of all weapons in any
warfare, Money!

“I—I scarcely know what I shall do,” she said. “Mrs. Darrell promised
to procure me a situation.”

But as she spoke she remembered that to accept a situation of Mrs.
Darrell’s getting would be in some manner to eat bread provided by the
kinswoman of her father’s foe, and she made a mental vow to starve
rather than to receive the widow’s patronage.

“I do not put much confidence in Mrs. Darrell’s friendship when her own
end is gained,” Gilbert Monckton said, thoughtfully. “Ellen Darrell is
only capable of loving one person, and that person is, according to the
fashion of the world, the one who has used her worst. She loves her
son, Launcelot, and would sacrifice a hecatomb of her fellow-creatures
for his advantage. If she can get you a new home, I dare say she will
do so. If she cannot, she has succeeded in removing you from her son’s
pathway, and will trouble herself very little about your future.”

Eleanor Vane lifted her head with a sudden gesture of pride.

“I do not want Mrs. Darrell’s help,” she said.

“But you would not refuse the counsel, or even the help of any one you
liked, would you, Eleanor?” returned the lawyer. “You are very young,
very inexperienced,—the life at Hazlewood suited you, and it might
have gone on for years without danger of unhappiness or disquiet, but
for the coming of Launcelot Darrell. I have known you for a year and
a half, Miss Vincent, and I have watched you very closely. I think I
know you very well. Yes, if a lawyer’s powers of penetration and habit
of observation are to go for anything, I _must_ know you by this time.
I may have been an egregious fool twenty years ago; but I must be wise
enough now to understand a girl of eighteen.”

He said this rather as if reasoning with himself than talking to
Eleanor. Miss Vane looked at him, wondering what all this talk would
lead to, and what motive, under heaven, could have induced a lawyer of
high standing to leave his chambers in the middle of the business day,
for the purpose of sitting in a shabby lodging-house chamber, with his
elbow resting upon a dirty tablecloth amid the confusion of unwashed
breakfast cups and saucers.

“Eleanor Vincent,” Mr. Monckton said by-and-by, after a very long
pause, “country people are most intolerable gossips. You cannot have
lived at Hazlewood for a year and a half without having heard something
of my history.”

“Your history?”

“Yes, you heard that there was some secret trouble in the early part of
my life—that there were some unpleasant circumstances connected with my
purchase of Tolldale.”

Eleanor Vane was unskilled in the art of prevarication. She could not
give an evasive answer to a straight question.

“Yes,” she said, “I have heard people say that.”

“And you have no doubt heard them say that my trouble—like every other
trouble upon this earth, as it seems to me—was caused by a woman.”

“Yes, I heard that.”

“I was very young when that sorrow came to me, Eleanor Vincent, and
very ready to believe in a beautiful face. I was deceived. My story is
all told in those three words, and it is a very old story after all.
Great tragedies and epic poems have been written upon the same theme,
until it has become so hackneyed that I have no need to enlarge upon
it. I was deceived, Miss Vincent, and for twenty years I have profited
by that bitter lesson. Heaven help me if I feel inclined to forget it
now. I am forty years of age, but I do not think that the brightness of
my life has quite gone yet. Twenty years ago I was in love, and in the
ardour and freshness of my youth, I dare say I talked a great deal of
nonsense. I am in love once more, Eleanor. Will you forgive me if all
my faculty for sentimental talk is lost? Will you let me tell you, in
very few and simple words, that I love you; that I have loved you for a
long time; and that you will make me unspeakably happy if you can think
my earnest devotion worthy of some return?”

Every vestige of colour faded slowly from Eleanor’s face. There had
been a time—before the return of Launcelot Darrell—when a word of
praise, an expression of friendliness or regard from Gilbert Monckton,
had been very precious to her. She had never taken the trouble to
analyze her feelings. That time, before the coming of the young man,
had been the sunniest and most careless period of her youth. She had
during that interval been false to the memory of her father—she had
suffered herself to be happy. But now a gulf yawned between her and
that lapse of forgetfulness. She could not look back clearly; she
could not remember or recall her former feelings. Gilbert Monckton’s
offer might then have awakened some answering sentiment in her own
breast. Now his hand struck upon the slackened chords of a shattered
instrument; and there was no music to respond harmoniously to the
player’s touch.

“Can you love me, Eleanor? Can you love me?” the lawyer asked,
imploringly, taking the girl’s two hands in his own.

“Your heart is free: yes, I know that; and that at least is something.
Heaven forgive me if I try to bribe you. But my youth is passed, and I
can scarcely expect to be loved for myself alone. Think how dreary and
undefended your life must be, if you refuse my love and protection.
Think of that, Eleanor. Ah! if you knew what a woman is when thrown
upon the world _without_ the shelter of a husband’s love, you would
think seriously. I want you to be more than my wife, Eleanor. I want
you to be the guardian and protectress of that poor frivolous girl
whose future has been trusted to my care. I want you to come and live
at Tolldale, my darling, so as to be near that poor child at Hazlewood.”

Near Hazlewood! The hot blood rushed into Eleanor’s face at the sound
of those two words, then faded suddenly away and left her deadly white,
trembling and clinging to the back of her chair for support. To all
else that Gilbert Monckton had said she had listened in a dull stupor.
But now her intellect arose and grasped the full importance of the
lawyer’s supplication. In a moment she understood that the one chance
which of all other things upon this earth she had most desired, and
which of all other things had seemed farthest removed from her, was now
within her reach.

She might go back to Hazlewood. She might return as Gilbert Monckton’s
wife. She did not stop to consider how much was involved in this. It
was her nature to be ruled by impulse, and impulse only; and she had
yet to learn submission to a better guidance. She could go back to
Hazlewood. She would have returned there as a kitchen-maid, had the
opportunity of so doing offered itself to her; and she was ready to
return as Gilbert Monckton’s wife.

“My prayers have been heard,” she thought. “My prayers have been heard:
Providence will give me power to keep my promise. Providence will set
me face to face with that man.”

Eleanor Vane stood with her hands clasped upon the back of her
chair, thinking of this, and looking straight before her, in utter
unconsciousness of the earnest eyes that were fixed upon her face,
while the lawyer waited breathlessly to hear her decision.

“Eleanor,” he cried, entreatingly, “Eleanor, I have been deceived once;
do not let me be a woman’s dupe, now that there are streaks of grey
amongst my hair. I love you, my dear. I can make you independent and
secure; but I do not offer you a fortune or a position of sufficient
magnitude or grandeur to tempt an ambitious woman. For God’s sake do
not trifle with me. If you love me now, or can hope to love me in the
future, be my wife. But if any other image holds the smallest place in
your heart—if there is one memory, or one regret, that can come between
us, Eleanor, dismiss me from you unhesitatingly. It will be merciful to
me—to you also, perhaps, to do so. I have seen many a union in which
there has been love on one side, and indifference—or something worse
than indifference—upon the other. Eleanor, think of all this, and then
tell me, frankly, if you can be my wife.”

Eleanor Vane dimly comprehended that there was a depth of passionate
feeling beneath the quiet earnestness of the lawyer’s manner. She tried
to listen, she tried to understand; but she could not. The one idea
which held possession of her mind, kept that mind locked against every
other impression. It was not his love, it was not his name, or his
fortune, that Gilbert Monckton offered her—he offered her the chance of
returning to Hazlewood.

“You are very good to me,” she said. “I will be your wife. I will go
back to Hazlewood.”

She held out her hand to him. No trace of womanly confusion, or natural
coquetry, betrayed itself in her manner. Pale and absorbed, she held
out her hand, and offered up her Future as a small and unconsidered
matter, when set against the one idea of her life—the promise to her
dead father.




CHAPTER XXV.

ACCEPTED.


When a man sets his happiness in the balance, he is apt to be contented
with a very slight turning of the scale. He is not likely to be
critical as to the wording of the verdict which gives him the prize he
has asked for.

Mr. Gilbert Monckton had no contemptible opinion of his own judgment
and deliberation, his perceptive faculties and powers of reasoning; but
as blindly as Macbeth accepted the promises of the oracular voices in
the witches’ cave, so did this grave and eminent lawyer receive those
few cold words in which Eleanor Vane consented to be his wife.

It was not that he refrained from reflecting upon the girl’s manner of
accepting his offer. He did reflect upon it; and proved to himself,
by unerring logic, that she could scarcely have spoken in any other
way. There were a thousand reasons why she should have employed those
very words, and pronounced them in that very tone. Maidenly modesty,
innocent surprise, inexperience, girlish timidity:—he ran over a whole
catalogue of causes, naming every possible cause, save one, and that
one was the thing he had most dreaded—indifference, or even repugnance
to himself. He looked into her face. His professional career had
given him the faculty of putting together the evidences of smiles and
frowns, involuntary contractions of the eyebrows, scarcely perceptible
compressions of the lips, every tone and semi-tone in the facial
diapason. He looked at Eleanor Vane’s face, and said to himself:

“This girl _cannot_ be mercenary. She is as pure as an angel; as
unselfish as Jephtha’s daughter; as brave as Judith, or Joan of Arc.
She _cannot_ be anything but a good wife. The man who wins her has
reason to thank God for his bounty.”

It was with such thoughts as these that the lawyer received the
feminine decision which was to influence his future life. He bent over
the girl’s fair head—tall as she was, her face was only on a level
with Gilbert Monckton’s shoulder—and pressed his lips to her forehead,
solemnly, almost as if setting a seal upon his own.

“My darling,” he said, in a low voice, “my darling, you have made
me very happy; I dare not tell you how much I love you. I struggled
against my love, Eleanor. I once meant to have kept the secret till I
went down to my grave. I think I could have kept silence so long as
you remained within my reach, protected and sheltered by people whom
I could trust, happy in the bright years of your innocent girlhood.
But when you left Hazlewood, when you went out into the world, my
courage failed. I wanted to give you my love as a shield and a defence.
Better that I should be deceived, I thought; better that I should be
miserable, than that she should be undefended.”

Eleanor Vane listened to the lawyer’s happy talk. He could have talked
to her for ever, now that the ice was broken, and the important step—so
long considered, so long avoided—actually taken. It seemed as if his
youth came back to him, bestowed by some miraculous power; invisible,
but most palpably present in that shabby Bloomsbury dwelling. His
youth came back; the intellectual cobwebs of twenty years were swept
away by one stroke of some benevolent witch’s broomstick. Cherished
prejudices, fondly nursed doubts and suspicions, were blotted out of
his mind, leaving the tablet fair and bright as it had been before the
coming of that shadow which had darkened so much of this man’s life.
Sudden almost as the conversion of Saul, was this transformation of the
misanthropical solicitor under the master influence of a true and pure
affection.

For twenty years he had sneered at women, and at men’s belief in them;
and now, at the end of twenty years, he believed; and, escaping out of
the prison which he had made for himself, he spread his recovered wings
and was free.

A sigh escaped from Eleanor’s lips as she listened to her lover. The
time in which she could have hoped to pay him back all this great
debt which he was heaping upon her, was past and gone. She felt a
sense of oppression beneath the load of this obligation. She began
to perceive—as yet only dimly, so intense was the egotism engendered
out of the single purpose of her life—that she was binding herself to
something that she might not be able to perform; she was taking upon
herself a debt that she could scarcely hope to pay. For a moment she
thought this, and was ready, under this new impulse, to draw back
and say, “I cannot become your wife; I am too much tied and bound
by the obligations of the past, to be able to fulfil the duties of
the present. I am set apart from other women, and must stand alone
until the task I have set myself is accomplished, or the hope of its
fulfilment abandoned.”

She thought this, and the words trembled on her lips; but in the next
moment the image of her father arose angry and reproachful, as if to
say to her, “Have you so little memory of my wrongs and my sorrows that
you can shrink from any means of avenging me?”

This idea banished every other consideration.

“I will keep my promise first, and do my duty to Gilbert Monckton
afterwards,” thought Eleanor. “It will be easy to be a good wife to
him. I used to like him very much.”

She recalled the old days in which she had sat a little way apart from
the lawyer and his ward, envying Laura Mason her apparent influence
over Mr. Monckton; and for a moment a faint thrill of pleasure and
triumph vibrated through her veins as she remembered that henceforth
her claim upon him would be higher than that of any other living
creature. He would be her own—her lover, her husband—adviser, friend,
instructor; everything in the wide world to her.

“Oh, let me avenge my father’s cruel death,” she thought, “and then I
may be a good and happy wife.”

Mr. Monckton could have stood for ever by the side of his betrothed
wife in the sunny window looking out upon the mews. The prospect of
the half-open stable doors; the lounging grooms smoking and drinking
in the intervals of their labour; the scantily draperied women hanging
out newly-washed linen, and making as it were triumphal arches of
wet garments across the narrow thoroughfare; the children playing
hop-scotch, or called away from that absorbing diversion to fetch damp
steaming quartern loaves and jugs of beer for their elders,—all these
things were beautiful in the eyes of the owner of Tolldale Priory. An
overplus of that sunshine which filled his own breast glorified these
common objects, and Mr. Monckton gazed upon the angular proportions of
the bony Roman-nosed horses, the classic outlines of decrepit Hansom
cabs, and all the other objects peculiar to the neighbourhood of the
Pilasters, with such a radiance of contentment and delight upon his
countenance as might have induced the observer, looking at the lawyer’s
face, and _not_ at the prospect, to believe that the bay of Naples was
spread out in purple splendour under the open window of Miss Vane’s
sitting-room.

Signora Picirillo returned from her day’s labours, and found Eleanor’s
visitor thus absorbed; but he understood directly who she was,
and greeted her with a cordiality that very much astonished the
music-mistress. Eleanor Vane slipped out of the room while Mr. Monckton
was explaining himself to the Signora. She was only too glad to get
away from the man to whom she had so rashly bound herself. She went to
the glass to brush her hair away from her hot forehead, and then threw
herself on the bed, prostrated by all the excitement she had undergone,
powerless even to think.

“I almost wish I could lie here for ever,” she thought: “it seems so
like peace to lie still and leave off thinking.” Her youth had held out
bravely against the burdens she had put upon her strength and spirits,
but the young energies had given way at last, and she fell into a heavy
dreamless slumber: a blessed and renovating sleep, from which nature
takes compensation for the wrongs that have been done her.

Gilbert Monckton told his story very briefly and simply. He had no
occasion to say much himself, for Eleanor had written a great deal
about him in her letters to the Signora, and had often talked of him
during her one holiday at the Pilasters.

Eliza Picirillo was too entirely unselfish to feel otherwise than
pleased at the idea that Eleanor Vane had won the love of a good man,
whose position in life would remove her from every danger and from
every trial. But, mingled with this unselfish delight, there was a
painful recollection. The music-mistress had fathomed her nephew’s
secret; and she felt that Eleanor’s marriage would be a sad blow to
Richard Thornton.

“I don’t believe poor Dick ever hoped to win her love,” Signora
Picirillo thought; “but if he could have gone on loving her and
admiring her, and associating with her, in a frank brotherly way, he
might have been happy. Perhaps it’s better as it is, though; perhaps
that very uncertainty might have blighted his life, and shut him out
from some possible happiness.”

“As my dear girl is an orphan,” Gilbert Monckton said, “I feel that
you, Madame Picirillo, are the only person I need consult. I have heard
from Eleanor how much she owes you; and believe me that when I ask her
to become my wife, I do not wish her to be less your adopted daughter.
She has told me that in the greatest miseries of her life, you were as
true a friend to her as her own mother could have been. She has never
told me what those miseries were, but I trust her so fully that I do
not care to torment her with questions about a past which she tells me
was sorrowful.”

Eliza Picirillo’s eyelids fell under the earnest gaze of the lawyer:
she remembered the deception that had been practised upon Mrs. Darrell
in deference to the pride of Eleanor’s half-sister.

“This Mr. Monckton must know Nelly’s story before he marries her,”
thought the straightforward Signora. She explained this to Eleanor the
next morning, when the girl rose, invigorated by a long sleep, and
inspired by a desperate hopefulness—the hope of speedily avenging her
father’s wrongs.

For some time Miss Vane passionately combated the Signora’s arguments.
Why should she tell Gilbert Monckton her real name? she demanded. She
wished to keep it a secret from Mr. de Crespigny: from the people at
Hazlewood. She must keep it a secret, she said.

But little by little Eliza Picirillo overcame this determination. She
explained to the passionate girl that if her marriage was to be legally
unassailable, she must be married in her true name. She explained this:
and she said a great deal about the moral wrong which would be done if
Eleanor persisted in deceiving her future husband.

The marriage was pushed on with terrible haste, as it seemed to Richard
Thornton and the Signora; but even the brief delay that occurred
between Gilbert Monckton’s declaration of his love and the day fixed
for the wedding was almost intolerable to Eleanor. The all-important
step which was to make her the lawyer’s wife seemed nothing to her.
She ignored this great crisis of her life altogether, in her desire
to return to Hazlewood, to discover and denounce Launcelot Darrell’s
treachery before Maurice de Crespigny’s death.

There were preparations to be made, and a trousseau to be provided. It
was a very simple trousseau, fitter for the bride of some young curate
with seventy pounds a year, than for a lady who was to be mistress
of Tolldale Priory. Eleanor took no interest in the pretty girlish
dresses, pale and delicate in colour, simple and inexpensive in texture
and fashion, which the Signora chose for her protégée. There was a
settlement to be drawn up also; for Gilbert Monckton insisted upon
treating his betrothed as generously as if she had been a woman of
distinction, with an aristocratic father to bargain and diplomatize for
her welfare; but Eleanor was as indifferent to the settlement as about
the trousseau, and could scarcely be made to understand that, on and
after her wedding-day, she would be the exclusive possessor of a small
landed estate worth three hundred a year.

Once, and once only, she thanked Gilbert Monckton for his generosity;
and this was when, for the first time, the thought flashed into her
mind, that this three hundred a year, to which she was so indifferent,
would enable her to place Eliza Picirillo in a position of independence.

“Dear Signora,” she cried, “you shall never work after I am married.
How good it is of you to give me this money, Mr. Monckton,” she added,
her eyes filling with sudden tears; “I will try to deserve your
goodness, I will indeed.”

It was upon the evening on which Eleanor spoke these few grateful and
earnest words to her betrothed husband, that the revelation of her
secret was made.

“I am going to Doctors’ Commons to-morrow morning, Signora,” the lawyer
said, as he rose to leave the little sitting-room—he had spent his
evenings in the Pilasters during his brief courtship, perfectly at home
and unspeakably happy in that shabby and Bohemian colony. “Eleanor and
I have determined that our marriage is to take place at St. George’s,
Bloomsbury. It is to be a very quiet wedding. My two partners,
yourself, and Mr. Thornton, are to be the only witnesses. The Berkshire
people will be surprised when I take my young wife back to Tolldale.”

He was going away, when the Signora laid her hands on Eleanor’s
shoulder.

“You _must_ tell him to-night, Nelly,” she whispered; “he must not be
allowed to take out the license in a false name.”

The girl bent her head.

“I will do as you wish, Signora,” she said.

Five minutes afterwards, when Gilbert Monckton gave Eleanor his hand,
she said, quietly:

“Do not say good night yet. I will come down stairs with you; I have
something to say to you.”

She went down the narrow staircase, and out into the colonnade with
Mr. Monckton. It was ten o’clock; the shops were closed, and the
public-house was quiet. Under the August moonlight the shabby tenements
looked less commonplace, the dilapidated wooden colonnade was almost
picturesque. Miss Vane stood with her face turned frankly towards her
lover, her figure resting slightly against one of the slender pillars
before the shoemaker’s emporium.

“What is it that you want to tell me, Eleanor dearest?” Mr. Monckton
asked, as she paused, looking half-doubtfully in his face, uncertain
what she should say to him.

“I want to tell you that I have done very wrong—I have deceived you.”

“Deceived me! Eleanor! Eleanor!”

She saw the lawyer’s face turn pale under the moonlight. That word
deception had such a terrible meaning to him.

“Yes, I have deceived you. I have kept a secret from you, and I can
only tell it to you upon one condition.”

“Upon what condition?”

“That you do not tell it to Mr. de Crespigny, or to Mrs. Darrell, until
you have my permission to do so.”

Gilbert Monckton smiled. His sudden fears fled away before the
truthfulness of the girl’s voice, the earnestness of her manner.

“Not tell Mr. de Crespigny, or Mrs. Darrell?” he said; “of course not,
my dear. Why should I tell them anything which concerns you, and that
you wish me to keep from them?”

“You promise, then?”

“Most certainly.”

“You give me your solemn promise that you will not tell Mr. de
Crespigny, or any member of his family, the secret which I am going to
confide to you; under no circumstances whatever will you be tempted to
break that promise?”

“Why, Nelly,” cried Mr. Monckton, “you are as serious as if you were
the chief of a political society, about to administer some terrible
oath to a neophyte. I shall not break my promise, my dear, believe
me. My profession has accustomed me to keeping secrets. What is it,
Eleanor; what is this tremendous mystery?”

Miss Vane lifted her eyes, and looked full in her lover’s face, upon
the watch for any change of expression that might indicate displeasure
or contempt. She was very fearful of losing the lawyer’s confidence and
esteem.

“When I went to Hazlewood,” she said, “I went in a false name, not at
my own wish, but to please my sister, who did not want Mrs. Darrell to
know that any member of her family could be in a dependent position.
My name is not Vincent. I am Eleanor Vane, the daughter of Mr. de
Crespigny’s old friend.”

Gilbert Monckton’s astonishment was unbounded. He had heard George
Vane’s history from Mrs. Darrell, but he had never heard of the birth
of the old man’s youngest daughter.

“Eleanor Vane?” he said; “then Mrs. Bannister is your sister.”

“She is my half-sister, and it was at her wish that I went to Hazlewood
under a false name. You are not angry with me for having done so, are
you?”

“Angry with you? No, my dear, the deception was harmless enough; though
it was a piece of foolish pride upon your sister’s part. My Eleanor was
in no way degraded by having to turn her accomplishments to use and
profit. My poor, self-reliant girl,” he added, tenderly, “going out
into the world with a secret to keep. But why do you wish this secret
to be still preserved, Eleanor; you are not ashamed of your father’s
name?”

“Ashamed of his name? Oh, no, no!”

“Why keep your real name a secret, then?”

“I can’t tell you why. But you’ll keep your promise. You are too
honourable to break your promise.”

Mr. Monckton looked wonderingly at the girl’s earnest face.

“No, my dear, I won’t break my promise,” he said. “But I can’t
understand your anxiety for this concealment. However, we will say
nothing more about it, Nelly,” he added, as if in reply to an appealing
look from Miss Vane; “your name will be Monckton when you go back to
Berkshire; and nobody will dare to question your right to that name.”

The lawyer put his lips to the girl’s forehead, and bade her good night
upon the threshold of the shoemaker’s door.

“God bless you, my own darling!” he said, in a very low voice, “and
preserve our faith in each other. There must be no secrets between you
and me, Nelly.”




CHAPTER XXVI.

AN INSIDIOUS DEMON.


On a bright September morning a hired carriage took Miss Vane and her
friends to the quiet old church in Hart Street, Bloomsbury. There was a
little crowd assembled about the door of the shoemaker’s dwelling, and
sympathetic spectators were scattered here and there in the mews, for
a marriage is one of those things which the cleverest people can never
contrive to keep a secret.

Miss Eleanor Vane’s pale fawn-coloured silk dress, black mantle, and
simple white bonnet did not form the established costume of a bride,
but the young lady looked so very beautiful in her girlish dress
and virginal innocence, that more than one of the lounging grooms
who came out of the stables to see her go by to her hired carriage,
confidentially remarked to an acquaintance that he only wished he
could get such a young woman for _his_ missus. Richard Thornton was
not in attendance upon the fair young bride. There was a scene to be
painted for Spavin and Cromshaw upon that particular day which was more
important than any scene Dick had ever painted before. So the young
man set out early upon that September bridal morning, after saluting
Eleanor Vane in the most tender and brotherly fashion but I am sorry
to say that instead of going straight to the Royal Phœnix Theatre,
Mr. Thornton walked with a slow and listless gait across Westminster
Bridge, then plunged with a sudden and almost ferocious impetus into
the remotest intricacies of Lambeth, scowling darkly at the street boys
who came in his way, skirting the Archbishop’s palace, glowering at
the desolation of Vauxhall, and hurrying far away into the solitudes
of Battersea Fields, where he spent the better part of the afternoon
in the dreary parlour of an obscure public-house, drinking adulterated
beer, and smoking bad tobacco.

The Signora wore a rustling black silk dress—Eleanor’s present of the
previous Christmas—in honour of her protégée’s wedding; but Eliza
Picirillo’s heart was sadly divided upon this quiet bridal day; half
rejoicing in Miss Vane’s fortune and advancement; half sorrowful for
poor desolate Dick wandering away amongst the swamps by the water-side.

Mr. Monckton and his two partners were waiting for the bride in the
portico of the church. The senior of the two, an old man with white
hair, was to give Eleanor away, and paid her many appropriate though
rather obsolete compliments upon the occasion. Perhaps it was now for
the first time that Miss Vane began to regard the step she was about to
take as one of a somewhat serious and indeed awful nature; perhaps it
was now for the first time that she began to think she had committed a
sin in accepting Gilbert Monckton’s love so lightly.

“If he knew that I did not promise to marry him because I loved him,
but because I wanted to get back to Hazlewood,” she thought.

But presently the grave shadows passed away from her face and a faint
blush rose to her cheek and brow.

“I will love him by-and-by, when I have avenged my father’s death,” she
said to herself.

Some such thought as this was in her mind when she took her place
beside Gilbert Monckton at the altar.

The autumn sunshine streamed in upon them through the great windows
of the church, and wrapped them in yellow light, like the figures of
Joseph and Mary in an old picture. The bride and bridegroom looked
very handsome standing side by side in this yellow sunshine. Gilbert
Monckton’s twenty years’ seniority only dignified and exalted him;
investing the holy marriage promise of love and protection with a
greater solemnity than it could have had when spoken by a stripling of
one or two and twenty.

Everything seemed auspicious upon this wedding morning. The lawyer’s
partners were in the highest spirits, the beadle and pew-opener were
elevated by the idea of prospective donations. The Signora wept quietly
while the marriage service was being read, thinking of her nephew
Richard smoking and drinking desperately, perhaps, in his desolate
painting-room; but when the ceremony was over the good music-mistress
dried her tears, banishing all traces of sorrow before she kissed and
complimented the bride.

“You are to come and see us at the Priory, dear Signora,” Eleanor said,
as she clung about her friend before leaving the vestry; “Gilbert says
so, you know.”

Her voice faltered a little, and she glanced shyly at her husband as
she spoke of him by his Christian name. It seemed as if she had no
right to allude so familiarly to Mr. Monckton, of Tolldale Priory. And
presently Eliza Picirillo stood alone—or attended only by the beadle,
obsequiously attentive in proportion to the liberality of the donation
he had just received—under the portico of the Bloomsbury church,
watching the lawyer’s carriage drive away towards the Great Northern
railway station. Mr. Monckton, in the absence of any preference upon
Eleanor’s part, had chosen a quiet Yorkshire watering-place as the
scene of his honeymoon.

Signora Picirillo sighed as she went down the steps before the church,
and took her seat in the hired vehicle that was to take her back to the
Pilasters.

“So Bloomsbury has seen the last of Eleanor,” she thought, sadly; “we
may go down to see her, perhaps, in her grand new house, but she will
never come back to us. She will never wash the tea-things and make tea
and toast again for a tired-out old music-mistress.”

       *       *       *       *       *

The dying glory of red and orange in the last sunset of September
sank behind the grey line of the German Ocean, after the closing day
of Gilbert Monckton’s honeymoon. Upon the first of October the lawyer
was to take his young wife to Tolldale Priory. Mr. and Mrs. Monckton
walked upon the broad sands as that low orange light faded out of the
western sky. The lawyer was grave and silent, and every now and then
cast a furtive glance at his companion’s face. Sometimes that glance
was succeeded by a sigh.

Eleanor was paler and more careworn than she had looked since the day
after her visit to the shipbroker’s office. The quiet and seclusion
of the place to which Gilbert Monckton had brought his bride had
given her ample opportunity of brooding on the one idea of her life.
Had he plunged her into a vortex of gaiety, it is possible that she
might have been true to that deep-rooted purpose which she had so
long nursed in her breast; but, on the other hand, there would have
been some hope that the delights of change and novelty, delights to
which youth cannot be indifferent—might have beguiled the bride from
that for-ever-recurring train of thought which separated her from her
husband as effectually as if an ocean had rolled between them.

Yes, Gilbert Monckton had discovered the fatal truth that marriage
is not always union, and that the holiest words that were ever spoken
cannot weave the mystic web which makes two souls indissolubly one,
if there be one inharmonious thread in the magical fabric. Gilbert
Monckton felt this, and knew that there was some dissonant note in the
chord which should have been such a melodious combination.

Again and again, while talking to his wife—carried away, perhaps, by
the theme of which he was speaking, and counting on her sympathy as a
matter of course—he had looked into Eleanor’s face, and seen that her
thoughts had wandered far away from him and his conversation, into
some unknown region. He had no clue by which he could follow those
wanderings; no chance word ever fell from his wife’s lips which might
serve as the traitor silk that guided ruthless Eleanor to Rosamond’s
hiding-place. So thus, before the honeymoon was over, Gilbert Monckton
began to be jealous of his bride, thereby fostering for himself a nest
of scorpions, or a very flock of young vultures, which were henceforth
to make their meals off his entrails.

But it was not the ferocious or Othello-like jealousy. The green-eyed
monster did not appear under his more rugged and uncivilized form,
finding a vent for his passions in pillows, poisons, and poniards. The
monster disguised himself as a smooth and philosophical demon. He hid
his diabolical attributes under the gravity and wisdom of a friendly
sage. In other words, Gilbert Monckton, feeling disappointed at the
result of his marriage, set himself to reason upon the fact; and was
for ever torturing himself with silent arguments and mute conjectures
as to the cause of that indescribable something in his young wife’s
manner, which told him there was no perfect union between them. The
lawyer reproached himself for his weak folly in having built a fairy
palace of hope upon the barren fact of Eleanor’s acceptance of his
hand. Did not girls, situated as George Vane’s daughter had been
situated, marry for money, again and again, in these mercenary days?
Who should know this better than Gilbert Monckton the solicitor, who
had drawn up so many marriage settlements, been concerned in so many
divorces, and assisted at so many matrimonial bargains, whose sordid
motives were as undisguised as in any sale of cattle transacted in the
purlieus of Smithfield? Who should know better than he, that beautiful
and innocent girls every day bartered their beauty and innocence for
certain considerations set down by grave lawyers, and engrossed upon
sheets of parchment at so much per sheet?

He did know this, and in his mad arrogance he had said to himself,
“I—amongst all other men—will be an exception to the common rule. The
girl I marry is poor; but she will give herself to me for no meaner
considerations than my love, and my truth, and my devotion; and those
shall be hers until my dying day.”

Gilbert Monckton had said this; and already a mocking demon had made
a permanent perch for himself upon this wretched man’s shoulders, for
ever whispering insidious doubts into his ear, for ever instilling
shadowy fears into his mind.

Eleanor had not seemed happy during those few honeymoon weeks. She had
grown weary of the broad sands stretching far away, flat and desolate
under the September sky, and weary of the everlasting and unbroken
line that bounded that wide grey sea. This weariness she had displayed
frankly enough; but she had not revealed its hidden source, which
lay in her feverish impatience to go back to the neighbourhood of
Hazlewood, and to make the discovery she wished to make, before Maurice
de Crespigny’s death.

She had sounded her husband upon the subject of the old man’s health.

“Do you think Mr. de Crespigny will live long?” she asked, one day.

“Heaven knows, my dear,” the lawyer answered, carelessly. “He has been
an invalid for nearly twenty years now, and he may go on being an
invalid for twenty years more, perhaps. I fancy that his death will be
very sudden whenever it does happen.”

“And do you think that he will leave his money to Launcelot Darrell?”

Eleanor’s face grew a little paler as she mentioned the young man’s
name. The invisible familiar perched upon Mr. Monckton’s shoulder
directed the lawyer’s attention to that fact.

“I don’t know. Why should you be interested in Mr. Darrell’s welfare?”

“I am not interested in his welfare; I only asked you a question,
Gilbert.”

Even the malice of the familiar could take no objection to the tone in
which Eleanor said this: and Mr. Monckton was ashamed of the passing
twinge which Launcelot Darrell’s name had caused him.

“I dare say De Crespigny will leave his money to young Darrell, my
dear,” he said, in a more cordial voice; “and though I have no very
high opinion of the young man’s character, I think he ought to have the
fortune. The maiden ladies should have annuities, of course. Heaven
knows they have fought hard enough for the prize.”

“How can people act so contemptibly for the sake of money!” cried
Eleanor, with sudden indignation.

The lawyer looked admiringly at her glowing face, which had crimsoned
with the intensity of her feeling. She was thinking of her father’s
death, and of that hundred pounds which had been won from him on the
night of his suicide.

“No,” thought Mr. Monckton, “she cannot be mercenary. That bright
impulsive creature could never be guilty of any deliberate meanness—and
what could be a worse meanness than that of the woman who could marry a
man out of sordid and mercenary motives, beguiling him by a simulated
affection, in order to compass her own advancement?”

“If I have won her heart, in its untainted freshness,” thought Gilbert
Monckton, “I must be content, though that girlish heart may seem cold.
She will love me better by-and-by. She will learn to confide in me; she
will learn to sympathize with me.”

By such arguments as these Mr. Monckton endeavoured to satisfy
himself—and sometimes, indeed, succeeded in doing so—that his young
wife’s absent and thoughtful manner was a matter of course; the
thoughtfulness of a girl unused to her new position, and perhaps a
little bewildered by its strangeness. But on the morning of the first
of October, Gilbert Monckton perceived a change in Eleanor’s manner,
and on that morning the demon familiar took up a permanent station upon
the lawyer’s shoulder.

Mrs. Monckton was no longer grave and listless. A feverish impatience,
a sudden flow of high spirits, seemed to have taken possession of her.

“You observe,” whispered the demon familiar, as Mr. Monckton sat
opposite his wife in a compartment of the express train that was to
take them to London, _en route_ for Berkshire, “you observe the glow in
her cheeks, the brightness of her eyes. You saw her turn pale the other
day when she mentioned Launcelot Darrell’s name. You know what the
young man’s mother told you. You can do the commonest sum in logical
arithmetic, I suppose. You can put two and two together. Your wife has
been wearied to death of the north, and the sea, and the sands—and of
_you_. She is in high spirits to-day, and it is very easy to account
for the change in her manner. She is glad to go back to Berkshire—she
is glad to go back there, because _she will see Launcelot Darrell_.”

Mr. Monckton, with a cambric handkerchief thrown over his face, kept a
covert watch upon his wife from between its artfully adjusted folds,
and enjoyed such converse as this with the spirit he had chosen for his
companion.




CHAPTER XXVII.

SLOW FIRES.


The new life which began for Eleanor Monckton at Tolldale Priory seemed
very strange to her. The prim respectability of the old mansion
weighed heavily upon her spirits. The best part of her existence
had been spent in a very free-and-easy and Bohemian manner: and her
improved position was at first more strange than pleasant to her.
The well-trained servants who waited upon her in respectful silence,
acknowledging her as their mistress, and obsequiously eager to give
her pleasure, were very different people to the familiar landladies
of those lodgings in which she had lived with her father, or the
good-natured shoemaker-landlord at the Pilasters.

At Hazlewood she had been only a dependent; and those who served her
had given her their service out of love for her brightness and beauty;
rendering her little benefits with frank smiles and familiar greetings.
But the mistress of Tolldale had a certain dignity to support; and new
duties to learn in her new position.

At first those duties seemed very hard to the impulsive girl, who had a
sort of instinctive contempt for all ceremonial usages and stereotyped
observances. They seemed more especially hard, perhaps, because Gilbert
Monckton expected his young wife to assume her new position as a thing
of course, and was inclined to be very jealous of any omission that
derogated from her dignity.

He was inclined to be jealous of her girlish inconstancy of thought and
action, seeing in all this an evidence that she regretted the freedom
of her girlhood. He was inclined to be jealous. That one sentence
reveals the secret of a great deal of misery which this gentleman made
for himself. He was inclined to be jealous of anything and everything,
where his young wife was concerned.

It was thus that Gilbert Monckton began his married life. It was thus
that, of his own doing, he set a breach between himself and the woman
he idolized. And when the breach was made, and the dreary gulf of
distrust and misapprehension stretched black and impassable between
this weak man and that which he loved dearest in all the world, he
could only cast himself down beside the yawning ravine and bemoan his
desolation.

I have called Gilbert Monckton a weak man advisedly. In all the
ordinary business of life, and in all the extraordinary businesses that
fell in his professional pathway, the lawyer’s clearness of perception
and power of intellect were unsurpassed by any of his compeers. Strong;
stern; decided and unyielding, where his judgment was once formed; he
was trusted as an oracle by those who had dealings with him. But in his
love for his wife he was weaker and more irresolute than any desponding
swain of five-and-twenty.

He had been deceived once by a woman whom he had loved as he now loved
Eleanor; and he could not forget that early deception. The shadow that
had fallen upon his life was not to be lifted off by any sunshine of
trust and love. He had been deceived once, and he might be deceived
again.

The wrong which a woman’s falsehood does to the man whom she betrays is
a lasting and sometimes irrecoverable wrong. The wound festers, deep
down below the outer scar; and while sympathetic friends are rejoicing
in the slow obliteration of that surface evidence of the past, the
hidden canker still endures, gaining force by time.

The secret sorrow of Gilbert Monckton’s youth had made him suspicious
of all womanly truth and purity. He watched his wife, as it had been
his habit to watch his ward, doubtfully and fearfully; even when he
most admired her, regarding her in some wise as a capricious and
irresponsible being who might at any moment turn upon him and betray
him.

He had fought against his love for his ward’s beautiful companion.
He had tried to shut his mind against all consciousness of her
fascinations; he had endeavoured not to believe in her. If she had
stayed at Hazlewood, that silent struggle might have gone on in the
lawyer’s breast for years; but her sudden departure had taken the grave
man of forty off his guard. Hurried away by an impulse, he had revealed
the secret that had been so skilfully repressed, and, for the second
time in his life, perilled his happiness upon the hazard of a woman’s
truth.

“What do I know of her more than I knew of Margaret Ravenshaw?” he
thought sometimes; “can I trust her because she looks full in my
face, with eyes that are as clear as the sky above my head? There is
generally some landmark by which a man’s character can be understood,
however practiced he may be in hypocrisy; but a woman——Bah! a woman’s
beauty defies a physiognomist. We trust and believe because we admire.
‘She can’t be wicked with such a Grecian nose,’ we say. ‘Those red,
smiling lips cannot speak anything but the truth!’”

If Gilbert Monckton’s young wife had seemed happy in her new home, he
would have accepted the fair omen, and would have sunned himself in the
brightness of her gaiety. But she was not happy; he could clearly see
that; and day and night he tormented himself with vain endeavours to
find out the cause of her uncertain spirits, her fits of abstraction,
her long pauses of thoughtful silence.

And while Mrs. Monckton’s husband was nursing all these tortures, and
every day widening the gulf of his own making, his wife, absorbed by
her own secret purpose, was almost unconscious of all else in the
world. If she saw the lawyer’s face thoughtful or gloomy, she concluded
that his moodiness arose from business anxieties with which she had
no concern. If he sighed, she set down his melancholy to the same
professional causes. A tiresome will case, a troublesome chancery
suit—something in those dusty offices had annoyed him; and that
professional something had of course no concern for her.

Eleanor Monckton had taken upon herself an unnatural office; she had
assumed an abnormal duty; and her whole life fashioned itself to
fit that unwomanly purpose. She abnegated the privileges, and left
unperformed the duties, of a wife—true to nothing except to that fatal
promise made in the first madness of her grief for George Vane’s death.

She had been more than a week at Tolldale Priory, and she had not
advanced one step upon the road which she had so desperately determined
to pursue. She had not yet seen Launcelot Darrell.

Gilbert Monckton had spent the day after his return to Berkshire in
riding about the neighbourhood, calling upon those few people with whom
he kept up any acquaintance, and informing them of his marriage with
the young lady who, a few weeks before, had been the companion of his
ward. Of course he received friendly congratulations and good wishes
from every one to whom he imparted this intelligence; and of course
when his back was turned, the same people who had tendered those good
wishes set to work to wonder at his folly, and to prognosticate all
manner of evil from his absurd and imprudent marriage.

His longest visit was paid to Hazlewood, and here his tidings afforded
real and unmixed satisfaction. Launcelot Darrell was at work in his
painting-room, and was therefore out of the way of hearing the news.
The widow was pleased to think that Eleanor’s marriage would secure her
son against the immediate danger of taking a penniless wife; and Laura
was sincerely rejoiced at the idea of seeing her friend again.

“I may come to Tolldale soon, mayn’t I, Mr. Monckton?” she asked. “Dear
Nelly, I do so long to see her! But to think of her being married to
you! I never was so surprised in my life. Why, you must be old enough
to be her father. It does seem so funny!”

Gilbert Monckton did not feel particularly grateful to his ward for
the extreme candour of these remarks, but he invited the young lady to
spend the following day with Eleanor.

“I shall be in town to-morrow,” he said, “and I dare say Mrs. Monckton
will find the Priory dull.”

“Mrs. Monckton!” cried Laura; “oh, to be sure; why, that’s Nelly, of
course! Find the Priory dull? Yes, I should think she would indeed!
Poor Eleanor, in those damp, overgrown gardens, with the high walls all
round, and the tops of the trees above the walls. How lonely she’ll be.”

“Lonely! I shall come home to dinner every day.”

“Yes, at seven o’clock; and from breakfast time till seven poor Nell
must amuse herself in the best way she can. But I’m not going to
grumble; I’m only too happy to think she will be near me.”

Mr. Monckton stood by the garden gate—that gate near which he had so
often loitered with Eleanor—listening with no very great satisfaction
to his ward’s frivolous prattle. His young wife would feel unhappy in
the dulness of her new life, perhaps. If that were to be so, it would
be proof positive that she did not love him. He could never have felt
dull or lonely in her society, though Tolldale had been some grim and
isolated habitation in the middle of an African desert.

“So you think she will be dull, Laura?” he said, rather despondently.

“Why, _of course_ she will,” answered the young lady; “but now don’t
think me inquisitive, please,” she added, in a very insinuating tone,
“but I do _so_ much want you to tell me something.”

“You want me to tell you what?” asked the lawyer, rather sharply.

Laura linked her hand through his arm, and raising herself on tiptoe,
so as to bring her rosy lips within easier reach of his ear, whispered
archly,

“Does she _really_ love you? Was it _really_ a love match?”

Gilbert Monckton started as violently as if that infantine whisper had
been the envenomed hiss of a snake.

“What do you mean, child?” he said, turning sharply upon his ward; “of
course Eleanor and I married because we loved each other? Why else
should we have married?”

“No, to be sure. Girls marry for money sometimes. I heard Mrs. Darrell
say that one of the Penwoods, of Windsor, married a horrid, old, rich
city man for the sake of his money. But I don’t think Eleanor would do
that sort of thing. Only it seems so funny that she should have been in
love with you all the time.”

“All what time?”

“Why, all the time she and I were together. How could she help talking
of you, I wonder?”

The lawyer bit his lip.

“She never talked of me, then?” he said, with a feeble attempt to make
his tone careless.

“Oh, yes, she spoke of you sometimes, of course; but not in that way.”

“Not in what way? When will you learn to express yourself clearly, Miss
Mason? Are you going to be a child all your life?”

Gilbert Monckton’s ward looked up at him with a half comic look of
terror. He was not accustomed to speak so sharply to her.

“Don’t be angry, please,” she said, “I know I don’t always express
myself clearly. I dare say it’s because I used to get other girls to do
my themes—they call exercises in composition themes, you know—when I
was at school. I mean that Eleanor didn’t talk of you as if she was in
love with you—not as I talk—not as I _should_ talk of any one if I were
in love with them,” added the young lady, blushing very much as she
corrected herself.

Miss Mason had only one idea of the outer evidences of the
master-passion. A secret or unrequited affection, which did not make
itself known by copious quotations of Percy Shelley and Letitia London,
was in her mind a very commonplace affair.

Mr. Monckton shrugged his shoulders.

“Who set you up as a judge of how a woman should speak of the man she
loves?” he said, sharply. “My wife has too much modesty to advertise
her affection for any man. By the bye, Miss Mason, would you like to
come and live at Tolldale?”

Laura looked at her guardian with unmitigated surprise.

“Come and live at Tolldale!” she said; “I thought you didn’t like me; I
thought you despised me because I’m so frivolous and childish.”

“Despise you, Laura,” cried Gilbert Monckton, “not like you! My poor
dear child, what a brute I must have been if I ever have given you
such an impression as that. I am very fond of you, my dear,” he added,
gravely, laying his hand upon the girl’s head as he spoke, and looking
down at her with sorrowful tenderness. “I am very much attached to you,
my poor dear child. If I ever seem vexed with your girlish frivolity,
it is only because I am anxious about your future. I am very, very
anxious about your future.”

“But why are you so anxious?”

“Because your mother was childish and light-hearted like you, Laura,
and she was led to do a very cruel thing for want of thought.”

“My poor mother. Ah, how I wish you would tell me about her.”

Laura Mason looked very serious as she said this. Her hands were folded
round the lawyer’s arm; her bright blue eyes seemed to grow of a more
sombre colour as she looked earnestly upward to his grave face.

“Not now, my dear; some day; some day, perhaps, we’ll talk about all
that. But not now. You haven’t answered my question, Laura. Would you
like to live at Tolldale?”

The young lady blushed crimson and dropped her eyelids.

“I should dearly like to live with Eleanor,” she said. “But——”

“But what?”

“I don’t think it would be quite right to leave Mrs. Darrell, would
it? The money you pay her is of great use to her, you know; I have
heard her say she could scarcely get on without it, especially now that
Launcelot—now that Mr. Darrell has come home.”

The blushes deepened as Laura Mason said this.

The lawyer watched those deepening blushes with considerable
uneasiness. “She is in love with this dark-eyed young Apollo,” he
thought.

“You are very scrupulous about Mrs. Darrell and her convenience,
Laura,” he said. “I should have fancied you would have been delighted
to live with your old friend and companion. You’ll come to-morrow to
spend the day with Eleanor, I suppose?”

“Oh, yes; if you please.”

“I’ll send the carriage for you, after it has taken me to Slough.
Good-bye.”

Mr. Monckton rode slowly homewards. His interview with Laura had not
been altogether agreeable to him. The girl’s surprise at his marriage
with Eleanor had irritated and disturbed him. It seemed like a protest
against the twenty years that divided his age from that of his young
wife. There was something abnormal and exceptionable in the marriage,
it seemed, then; and the people who had congratulated him and wished
him well, were so many bland and conventional hypocrites, who no doubt
laughed in their sleeves at his folly.

The lawyer rode back to Tolldale Priory with a moody and overclouded
brow.

“That girl is in love with Launcelot Darrell,” he thought. “She
betrayed her secret in her childish transparence. The young man must
be wonderfully attractive, since people fall in love with him in this
manner. I don’t like him; I don’t believe in him; I should not like
Laura to be his wife.”

Yet in the next moment Mr. Monckton reflected that, after all, a
marriage between his ward and Launcelot might not be altogether
unadvisable. The young man was clever and gentlemanly. He came of a
good stock, and had at least brilliant expectations. He might marry
Laura and go to Italy, where he could devote a few years to the
cultivation of his art.

“If the poor child is in love with him, and he returns her affection,
it would be cruel to come between them with any prudential tyranny,”
thought Mr. Monckton. “The young man seems really anxious to achieve
success as an artist, and if he is to do so he ought certainly to study
abroad.”

The lawyer’s mind dwelt upon this latter point throughout the
remainder of his ride, and when he crossed the stone-paved hall
where the cavaliers’ boots and saddles hung in the glowing light
that stole through the emblazoned windows, he had almost come to
the determination that Laura Mason and Launcelot Darrell ought to be
married forthwith. He found his wife sitting in one of the windows of
the library, with her hands lying idle in her lap, and her eyes fixed
upon the garden before her. She started as he entered the room, and
looked up at him with a bright eagerness in her face.

“You have been to Hazlewood?” she said.

“Yes, I have just come from there.”

“And you have seen——?”

She stopped suddenly. Launcelot Darrell’s name had risen to her lips,
but she checked herself before uttering it, lest she should betray
her eager interest in him. She had no fear of that interest being
misconstrued; no idea of such a possibility had ever entered her head.
She only feared that some chance look or word might betray her vengeful
hatred of the young man.

“You saw Laura—and—and Mrs. Darrell, I suppose?” she said.

“Yes, I saw Laura and Mrs. Darrell,” answered Gilbert Monckton,
watching his wife’s face. He had perceived the hesitation with which
she had asked this question. He saw now that she was disappointed in
his reply.

Eleanor was incapable of dissimulation, and her disappointment betrayed
itself in her face. She had expected to hear something of Launcelot
Darrell, something which would have at least given her an excuse for
questioning her husband about him.

“You did not see Mr. Darrell, then?” she said, after a pause, during
which Mr. Monckton had placed himself opposite to her in the open
window. The afternoon sunshine fell full upon Eleanor’s face; lighting
up every change of expression; revealing every varying shade of thought
that betrayed itself unconsciously in a countenance whose mobility was
one of its greatest charms.

“No, Mr. Darrell was in his painting-room; I did not see him.”

There was a pause. Eleanor was silent, scarcely knowing how to fashion
any question that might lead to her gaining some information about the
man whose secrets she had set herself to unravel.

“Do you know, Eleanor,” said the lawyer after this pause, during
which he had kept close watch upon his wife’s face, “I think I have
discovered a secret that concerns Launcelot Darrell.”

“A secret?”

Sudden blushes lit up Eleanor Monckton’s cheeks like a flaming fire.

“A secret!” she repeated. “You have found out a secret!”

“Yes, I believe that my ward, Laura Mason, has fallen in love with the
young man.”

Eleanor’s face changed. Her feverish eagerness gave place to a look of
indifference.

“Is that all?” she said.

She had no very great belief in the intensity of Miss Mason’s feelings.
The girl’s sentimental talk and demonstrative admiration had to her
mind something spurious in their nature; Mrs. Monckton was ready to
love Laura very dearly when the business of her life should be done,
and she could have time to love anybody; but in the meantime she gave
herself no uneasiness about Miss Mason’s romantic passion for the young
painter.

“Laura is as inconstant as the wind,” she thought. “She will hate
Launcelot Darrell when I tell her how base he is.”

But what was Eleanor’s surprise when Mr. Monckton said, very quietly:

“If the girl is really attached to this young man, and he returns her
affection—she is so pretty and fascinating, that I should think he
could scarcely help being in love with her—I don’t see why the match
should not take place.”

Eleanor looked up suddenly.

“Oh, no, no, no,” she cried; “you would never let Laura marry Launcelot
Darrell.”

“And why not, Mrs. Monckton?”

The insidious imp which the lawyer had made his bosom companion of
late, at this moment transformed himself into a raging demon, and
gnawed ravenously at the vitals of its master.

“Why shouldn’t Laura marry Launcelot Darrell?”

“Because you have a bad opinion of him. What did you say to me by the
garden-gate at Hazlewood, when Mr. Darrell first came home? You said he
was selfish, shallow, frivolous; false, perhaps. You said there was a
secret in his life.”

“I thought so then.”

“And have you ceased to think so now?”

“I don’t know. I may have been prejudiced against the young man,”
answered Mr. Monckton, doubtfully.

“I don’t think you were,” Eleanor said; “I don’t think he is a good
man. Pray, pray don’t let Laura marry him.”

She clasped her hands in her eagerness, as she looked up in her
husband’s face.

Gilbert Monckton’s brow darkened.

“What does it matter to you?” he asked.

Eleanor looked surprised at the almost angry abruptness of her
husband’s manner.

“It matters a great deal to me,” she said. “I should be very sorry if
Laura were to make an unhappy marriage.”

“But must her marriage with Launcelot Darrell be necessarily unhappy?”

“Yes; because he is a bad man.”

“What right have you to say that, unless you have some special reason
for thinking it?”

“I have a special reason.”

“What reason?”

“I cannot tell you—now.”

The ravenous demon’s tooth grew sharper than usual when Eleanor said
this.

“Mrs. Monckton,” the lawyer said, sternly, “I am afraid that there can
be very little happiness in store for you and me if you begin your
married life by keeping secrets from your husband.”

Gilbert Monckton was too proud to say more than this. A dull despair
was creeping into his breast, a sick loathing of himself and of his
folly. Every one of those twenty years which made him his young wife’s
senior rose up against him, and gibed and twitted him.

What right had he to marry a young wife, and believe that she could
love him? What justification could he find for his own folly in taking
this girl from poverty and obscurity, and then expecting that she
should feel any warmer sentiment than some feeble gratitude to him for
having given her an advantageous bargain? He had given her a handsome
house and attentive servants, carriages and horses, prosperity and
independence, in exchange for her bright youth and beauty, and he was
angry with her because she did not love him.

Looking back at that interview in the Pilasters—every circumstance of
which was very clear to him now, by the aid of a pair of spectacles
lent him by the jealous demon, his familiar—Mr. Monckton remembered
that no confession of love had dropped from Eleanor’s lips. She had
consented to become his wife, nothing more. She had, no doubt—in
those moments of maidenly hesitation, during which he had waited so
breathlessly—deliberately weighed and carefully balanced the advantages
that were to be won from the sacrifice demanded of her.

Of course the perpetual brooding upon such fancies as these very much
tended to make Gilbert Monckton an agreeable and lively companion for
an impulsive girl. There is something remarkable in the persistency
with which the sufferer from that terrible disease called jealousy
strives to aggravate the causes of his torture.




CHAPTER XXVIII

BY THE SUNDIAL.


Laura Mason came to live at Tolldale. Gilbert Monckton argued with
himself that his most reasonable motive for marrying Eleanor Vane had
lain in his desire to provide a secure home and suitable companionship
for his ward. The girl was very glad to be with Eleanor; but a little
sorry to leave Hazlewood, now that Mr. Launcelot Darrell’s presence
gave a new charm to the place.

“Not that he is very lively, you know, Nelly,” Miss Mason remarked to
her guardian’s wife in the course of a long discussion of Mr. Darrell’s
merits. “He never seems happy. He’s always roaming about the place,
looking as if he had something upon his mind. It makes him look very
handsome, though, you know; I don’t think he’d look half so handsome if
he hadn’t anything on his mind. He was awfully dull and gloomy after
you went away, Nell; I’m sure he must have been in love with you. Mrs.
Darrell says he wasn’t; and that he admires another person: quite a
different person. Do you think I’m the person, Eleanor dear?” asked
the young lady, blushing and smiling, as she looked shyly up at her
companion’s grave face.

“I don’t know, Laura; but I almost hope not, for I should be very sorry
if you were to marry Launcelot Darrell,” Eleanor said.

“But why should you be sorry, Nelly?”

“Because I don’t think he’s a good man.”

Miss Mason pouted her under lip and shrugged her shoulders, with the
prettiest air of impatience.

“It’s very unkind of you to say so, Nell,” she exclaimed. “I’m sure
he’s good! Or if he isn’t good, I like him all the better for it,” she
added, with charming inconsistency. “I don’t want to marry a good man,
like my guardian, or Mr. Neate, the curate of Hazlewood parish. The
Corsair wasn’t good; but see how fond Gulnare and Medora were of him. I
don’t suppose it was good of the Giaour to kill Hassan; but who could
have had the heart to refuse to marry the Giaour?”

Mrs. Monckton did not attempt to argue with a young lady who expressed
such opinions as these. Laura’s romantic infatuation only made Eleanor
more impatient for the coming of that hour in which she should be able
to denounce Launcelot Darrell as a cheat and a traitor.

“He shall be disappointed in his hope of a fortune, and through me,”
she thought. “He shall be cast off by the woman who has loved him,
and through me. And when he suffers most I will be as pitiless to
his suffering, as he was pitiless to the old man whom he cheated and
abandoned to despair.”

A fortnight passed after Eleanor’s arrival at the Priory before she
had any opportunity of seeing Launcelot Darrell. She had proposed
going to Hazlewood several times, but upon each occasion Mr. Monckton
had contrived to interpose some objection to her visit. She began
to despair of entering upon the silent struggle with her father’s
destroyer. It seemed as if she had come to Tolldale for no purpose. In
her impatience she dreaded that Maurice de Crespigny would die, leaving
his fortune to his nephew. She knew that the old man’s life hung by a
slender thread, which at any moment might be severed.

But at last the opportunity she had so anxiously awaited arrived
unexpectedly, not brought about by any scheming or foresight upon her
part. Laura had been a few days at the Priory, and the two girls were
walking in one of the sheltered pathways of the old-fashioned garden,
waiting for Gilbert Monckton’s arrival, and the clanging summons of the
great dinner-bell.

The October sunshine was bright and pleasant; the autumn flowers
enlivened the dark luxuriance of the garden with their gaudy splendour.
The tall hollyhocks waved in the breeze.

The two girls had walked up and down the smooth gravel path for some
time in silence. Eleanor was absorbed in her own thoughts, and even
Laura could not talk for ever without encouragement.

But presently this latter young lady stopped with a blush and a start,
clasping her hand tightly about her companion’s wrist. At the other
end of the sheltered walk, amongst the flickering patches of sunshine
that trembled on the filbert-trees, she had perceived Launcelot Darrell
advancing towards them.

Eleanor looked up.

“What is the matter, Laura?” she asked.

In the next moment she recognized Mr. Darrell. The chance had come at
last.

The young man advanced to meet Mrs. Monckton and her companion. He was
pale, and had a certain gravity in his face expressive of some hidden
sorrow. He had been in love with Eleanor Vane, after his own fashion,
and was very much disposed to resent her desertion of him. His mother
had told him the reason of that desertion very frankly, after Eleanor’s
marriage.

“I come to offer you my congratulations, Mrs. Monckton,” he said,
in a tone which was intended to wound the young wife to the quick,
but which, like everything else about this young man, had a certain
spuriousness, an air of melodrama that robbed it of all force. “I
should have accompanied my mother when she called on you the other
day—but——”

He paused abruptly, looking at Laura with an air of ill-concealed
vexation.

“Can I speak to you alone, Mrs. Monckton?” he asked; “I have something
particular to say to you.”

“But you can say it before Laura, I suppose?”

“No, not before Laura, or before any one. I must speak to you alone.”

Miss Mason looked at the object of her admiration with a piteous
expression in her childish face.

“How cruel he is to me,” she thought; “I do believe he is in love with
Eleanor. How wicked of him to be in love with my guardian’s wife.”

Mrs. Monckton did not attempt to refuse the privilege which the young
man demanded of her.

“I am quite willing to hear anything you may have to say to me,” she
said.

“Oh, very well!” cried Laura. “I’m sure I’ll go away if you want to
talk about secrets that I mustn’t hear. Only I don’t see how you can
have any secrets. You haven’t known Mr. Darrell a day longer than I
have, Eleanor; and I can’t imagine what he can have to say to you.”

After this protest Miss Mason turned her back upon her companions, and
ran away towards the house. She shed a few silent tears behind the
shelter of a great clump of chrysanthemums.

“He doesn’t care for me a bit,” she muttered, as she dried her eyes:
“Mrs. Darrell is a wicked old story-teller. I feel just as poor Gulnare
must have felt when the Corsair was so rude to her, after she’d
committed a murder for his sake.”

Eleanor and Launcelot left the sheltered pathway, and walked slowly
across the broad lawn towards an old sundial, quaint in shape, and
covered with the moss that had slowly crept over the grey stonework.
Here the young man stopped, lounging against the moss-grown pedestal,
and resting his elbow upon the broken dial.

“I have come here to-day to tell you that you have treated me very ill,
Eleanor Monckton,” he said.

The young wife drew herself up proudly.

“What do you mean?” she asked.

“I mean that you jilted me.”

“Jilted you!”

“Yes. You played fast and loose with me. You listened to my declaration
of love. You suffered me to believe that you loved me.”

“Mr. Darrell!”

“You did more, Eleanor,” cried the young man, passionately; “you _did_
love me. This marriage with Gilbert Monckton, a man twenty years your
senior, is a marriage prompted by base and mercenary motives. You loved
me, Eleanor; your silence admitted it that day, if your words did not.
You had no right to be cajoled by my mother; you had no right to leave
Hazlewood without a word of explanation to me. You are false-hearted
and mercenary, Mrs. Monckton; and you have married this man here
because he is the owner of a fine house, and can give you money to
spend upon your womanly caprices—your selfish vanities.”

He pointed scornfully to her silk dress as he spoke, and to the golden
trinkets that guttered at her waist.

She looked at him with a strange expression in her face.

“Think of me as you please,” she said; “think that I was in love with
you, if you like.”

It was as if she had said to him, “Fall into a trap of your own
setting, if you please. I am not base enough to lay such a snare for
you.”

“Yes, Eleanor, you were false and mercenary. You were foolish, perhaps,
as well: for I may be a rich man before very long. I may be master of
the Woodlands property.”

“I don’t think you ever will inherit that fortune,” Eleanor said,
slowly. “You talk of my being base and mercenary; you are at liberty to
think so if you please. But have _you_ never done base things for the
sake of money, Launcelot Darrell?”

The man’s face darkened.

“Nobody is immaculate, I dare say,” he answered. “I have been very
poor, and have been obliged to do what the rest of the world does when
its purse is empty.”

As Eleanor watched his moody face she suddenly remembered that this
was not the way her cards must be played. The task which she had set
herself to perform was not to be accomplished by candour and openness.
This man had betrayed her father, and she must betray him.

She held out her hand to Launcelot Darrell.

“Let us be friends,” she said; “I wish to be friends with you.”

There were two witnesses looking on at this gesture. Laura Mason was
standing by her guardian, watching the group beside the sundial.
Gilbert Monckton had returned from town, and had come into the garden
in search of his wife.

“They sent me away from them,” Laura said, as her guardian looked at
Launcelot and Eleanor. “He had something particular to say to her: so I
wasn’t to hear it, and they sent me away. You’ll ask him to dinner, I
suppose?”

“No,” answered the lawyer, sharply.

Launcelot Darrell held Eleanor’s hand some moments before he released
it.

“I wish to be friends with you, Mr. Darrel!,” she said; “I’ll come to
Hazlewood to-morrow to see your pictures, if you please. I want to see
how the Rosalind and Celia goes on.”

She hated herself for her hypocrisy. Every generous impulse of her soul
revolted against her falsehood. But these things were only a natural
part of the unnatural task which she had set herself to perform.




CHAPTER XXIX.

KEEPING WATCH.


Two pair of jealous eyes kept constant watch upon Eleanor Monckton for
some time after that October afternoon on which the lawyer and Miss
Mason stood side by side, looking at the two figures by the sundial.

Gilbert Monckton was too proud to complain. He laid down the fair hopes
of his manhood in the grave that already held the broken dreams of his
youth. He bowed his head and resigned himself to his fate.

“I was mistaken,” he thought; “it was too preposterous to suppose that
at forty I could win the love of a girl of eighteen. My wife is good
and true, but——”

But what? Could this girl be good and true? Had she not deceived her
lover most cruelly, most deliberately, in her declaration of utter
indifference towards Launcelot Darrell.

Mr. Monckton remembered her very words, her sudden look of
astonishment, her almost shuddering gesture of surprise, as he asked
the important question,

“And you do not love Launcelot Darrell?”

“Love him! oh, no, no, no!”

And in spite of this emphatic denial, Mrs. Monckton had, ever since her
arrival at Tolldale Priory, betrayed an intense, an almost feverish
interest in the young scapegrace artist.

“If she is capable of falsehood,” thought the lawyer, “there must
surely be no truth upon this earth. Shall I trust her and wait
patiently for the solution of the mystery? No; between man and wife
there should be no mystery! She has no right to keep any secret from
me.”

So Mr. Monckton hardened his heart against his beautiful young wife,
and set himself sternly and indefatigably to watch her every look, to
listen to every intonation of her voice, to keep a rigorous guard over
his own honour and dignity.

Poor Eleanor was too innocent to read all these signs aright; she
only thought that her husband was changed; that this stern and gloomy
companion was not the same Gilbert Monckton whom she had known at
Hazlewood; not the patient “guide, philosopher, and friend,” whose
subdued bass voice, eloquent in the dusky evenings long ago—a year is
very long to a girl of eighteen—in Mrs. Darrell’s simple drawing-room,
had seemed a kind of intellectual music to her.

Had she not been absorbed always by that one thought, whose intensity
had reduced the compass of her mind to a monotone, the young wife would
very bitterly have felt this change in her husband. As it was she
looked upon her disappointment as something very far away from her;
something to be considered and regretted by-and-by; by-and-by, when the
grand business of her life was done.

But while the gulf between the young wife and her husband every day
grew wider, this grand business made no progress. Day after day, week
after week passed by, and Eleanor Monckton found herself no nearer the
end.

She had paid several visits to Hazlewood; she had acted her part to
the best of her abilities, which were very mediocre in all matters
where deception is necessary; she had watched and questioned Launcelot
Darrell; but she had obtained no vestige of proof to set before Maurice
de Crespigny when she denounced his niece’s son.

No; whatever secrets were hidden in the young man’s breast, he was
so guarded as to baffle Eleanor Monckton at every point. He was so
thoroughly self-possessed as to avoid betraying himself by so much as a
look or a tone.

He was, however, thrown a good deal in Eleanor’s society, for Mr.
Monckton, with a strange persistence, encouraged the penniless artist’s
attentions to Laura Mason; while Launcelot Darrell, too shallow to
hold long to any infatuation, influenced upon one side by his mother,
and flattered upon the other by Laura’s unconcealed admiration, was
content, by-and-by, to lay down his allegiance at this new shrine, and
to forgive Mrs. Monckton for her desertion.

“Eleanor and my mother were both right, I dare say,” the young man
reflected, contemplating his fate with a feeling of despondent languor.
“They were wiser than I was, I dare say. I ought to marry a rich woman.
I could never drag out an existence of poverty. Bachelor poverty is bad
enough, but, at least, there’s something artistic and Bohemian about
that. Chambertin one day, and vin ordinaire the next; Veuve Clicquot
at the Trois Frères or the Café de Paris to-night, and small beer in
a garret to-morrow morning. But married poverty! Squalid desolation
instead of reckless gaiety; a sick wife and lean hungry children, and
the husband carrying wet canvases to the pawnbroker! Bah! Eleanor was
right; she has done a good thing for herself; and I’d better go in and
win the heiress, and make myself secure against any caprice of my
worthy great-uncle.”

It was thus that Launcelot Darrell became a frequent visitor at
Tolldale Priory, and as, at about this time, Mr. Monckton’s business
became so unimportant as to be easily flung entirely into the hands
of the two junior partners, the lawyer was almost always at home to
receive his guest.

Nothing could have been more antagonistic than the characters of the
two men. There was no possibility of sympathy or assimilation between
them. The weakness of one was rendered more evident by the strength of
the other. The decided character of the lawyer seemed harsh and rigid
when contrasted with the easy-going languid good-nature of the artist.

Eleanor Monckton, perceiving this wide difference between the two men,
admired her husband as much as she despised Launcelot Darrell.

If the lawyer could have known this,—if he could have known that when
his wife’s earnest eyes followed every change of expression in the
young man’s face, when she listened most intently to his careless and
rambling, yet sometimes almost brilliant talk, she read his shallow
nature and its worthlessness better than that nature had ever yet been
read by the closest observer,—if Gilbert Monckton could have understood
these things, what wasted agonies, what futile tortures, might have
been spared him!

“What would have become of me if I had loved this man?” Eleanor
thought, as day by day, with an intellect rendered preternaturally
clear by the intensity of her one desire, she grew more familiar with
Launcelot Darrell’s character.

In the meanwhile, Laura Mason walked along a pathway of roses, whose
only thorns were those jealous twinges which the young lady experienced
on account of Eleanor Monckton.

“He loved her first,” the heiress thought, despondently, “I know he
did, and he made her an offer upon the day the dressmaker brought home
my blue silk, and it was so short-waisted I was obliged to make her
take it back for alteration. And that was why she—I mean Eleanor, not
the dressmaker—left Hazlewood. And it’s not pleasant to think that the
man one idolizes has idolized somebody else not three months before he
proposes to one; and I don’t think it was right of Eleanor to lead him
on.”

It was by this latter very vague phrase that Miss Mason was in the
habit of excusing her lover’s delinquency. Eleanor had led him on;
and he was thereby in a manner justified for that brief infatuation
which had beguiled him from poor Laura. In what this “leading on”
had consisted the young lady did not seek to understand. She wanted
to forgive her lover, and she wanted reasons for her forgiveness;
as weak women do when they deliver themselves up to the bondage of
a sentimental affection for a handsome face. But although Launcelot
Darrell had made his peace with Mr. Monckton’s ward, wooing her with
a great many tender words and pretty stereotyped phrases under the
gloomy shadow of the yew-trees in the old-fashioned priory garden,
and although he had formally demanded her hand, and had been accepted
by her guardian and herself, Laura was not yet quite satisfied. Some
lingering sentiment of distrust still held its place in her breast, and
the jealous twinges, which, as I have said, constituted the thorns upon
her rose-bestrewn pathway, were very sharp and numerous.

Nor was Mr. Monckton wholly free from anxiety on his ward’s account.
He had consented to her engagement with Launcelot Darrell. He had done
even more; he had encouraged the young man’s suit; and now that it was
too late to undo his work, he began to argue with himself as to the
wisdom of his conduct.

He tried to palter with his conscience; but he could not disguise from
himself that the leading motive which had induced him to consent to his
ward’s engagement was his desire to remove Launcelot Darrell out of the
society of his wife. He could not be so blind to his own weakness as to
be unaware of the secret pleasure he felt in being able to demonstrate
to Eleanor the worthlessness of an affection which could be so easily
transferred from one object to another.

Apart from this, Gilbert Monckton tried to believe that he had taken
the best course within his power of choice, for the frivolous girl whom
it was his duty to protect. To have opposed Laura’s attachment would
have been to cause her great unhappiness. The young man was clever and
agreeable. He was the descendant of a race which was almost noble by
right of its origin. His character would grow stronger with time, and
it would be the guardian’s duty to foster all that was good in the
nature of his ward’s husband; and to put him in a fair way of occupying
an honourable position.

“I will try and develope his talent—his genius, perhaps,” Gilbert
Monckton thought; “he shall go to Italy, and study the old masters.”

So it was settled that the marriage should take place early in the
spring, and that Launcelot and his wife should start immediately
afterwards upon a tour through the great art cities of the continent.
It was arranged that they should remain away for at least a
twelvemonth, and that they should spend the winter in Rome.

Eleanor Monckton grew deathly pale when her husband announced to her
the probable date of the marriage.

“So soon!” she said, in a low, half-stifled voice. “So soon! why,
December has already begun—the spring will be here directly.”

Gilbert Monckton watched her face with a thoughtful frown.

“What is there to wait for?” he said.

Eleanor was silent for a few moments. What could she say? Could she
suffer this engagement to continue? Could she allow Launcelot Darrell
to hold his place amongst these people who so ignorantly trusted in
him? She would have spoken, perhaps, and confided at least some part
of her secret to her husband, but she refrained from doing so: for
might not he too laugh at her, as Richard Thornton had done? Might not
he, who had grown lately cold and reserved in his manner towards her,
sometimes even sarcastic and severe—might not he sternly reprobate her
mad desire for vengeance, and in some manner or other frustrate the
great purpose of her life?

She had trusted Richard Thornton, and had implored his help. No
good had ever come of that confidence: nothing but remonstrances,
reproaches, entreaties; even ridicule. Why, then, should she trust any
one else? No, she was resolved henceforward to hold her secret in her
own keeping, and to look to herself alone for victory.

“Why should the marriage be delayed?” Mr. Monckton demanded, rather
sharply, for the second time; “is there any reason for delay?”

“No,” Eleanor faltered, “not if you think Mr. Darrell worthy of Laura’s
confidence; not if you think him a good man.”

“Have you any reason to think otherwise of him?”

Mrs. Monckton evaded a direct answer to this question.

“It was you who first taught me to doubt him,” she said.

“Indeed!” answered her husband; “I had quite forgotten that. I wonder,
Eleanor, that you should appear so much interested in this young man,
since you have so bad an opinion of him.”

Mr. Monckton left the room after launching this dart at the breast
which he believed was guilty of hiding from him a secret regard for
another.

“God help her, poor child!” thought the lawyer, “she married me for my
position; and perhaps thought that it would be an easy thing to conquer
some slight sentimental predilection for Launcelot Darrell. She tries
to do her duty, I believe; and when this young man is safely out of the
way she may learn to love me perhaps.”

Such reflections as these were generally followed by a change in the
lawyer’s manner, and Eleanor’s failing spirits revived in the new
sunshine of his affection. She had respected and admired Gilbert
Monckton from the hour of her meeting with him at the Great Western
terminus; and she was ready to love him truly and cordially whenever
she could succeed in her great purpose, and disengage her mind from its
one absorbing idea.




CHAPTER XXX.

AN OLD MAN’S FANCY.


Although Eleanor Monckton’s utmost watchfulness revealed to her nothing
that could be twisted into a proof of Launcelot Darrell’s identity with
the man who had been the indirect cause of her father’s death, she made
some progress in another quarter, very much to the annoyance of several
people, amongst whom must be included the young painter.

Maurice de Crespigny, who for some years past had not been known to
take an interest in anything, exhibited a very great interest in
Gilbert Monckton’s young wife.

The old man had never forgotten the day upon which he had been
suddenly carried back to the past, by the apparition of a fair-haired
girl who seemed to him the living image of his lost friend. He had
never forgotten this: and when, a few days after Eleanor’s arrival at
Tolldale, he happened to encounter her in one of his airings, he had
insisted on stopping to talk to her, much to the aggravation of his two
maiden warders.

Eleanor caught eagerly at any chance of becoming familiar with her
father’s friend. It was to him she looked for her promised vengeance.
The law could give her no redress; but Maurice de Crespigny held in his
hand the disposition of that wealth for which his young kinsman hoped,
and thus possessed power to punish the cheat and traitor who had robbed
a helpless old man.

Even if this motive had not existed, Eleanor’s love for her dead
father would have been sufficient to inspire her with every tender
feeling towards the owner of Woodlands. Her manner, modified by this
tenderness, acted almost like a spell upon Maurice de Crespigny. He
insisted upon coming, in the course of his daily airing, to that part
of the grounds where the two estates were only divided by a slender
wire fence, and where he might hope to meet Eleanor. By-and-by he
extorted from her the promise to meet him on every fine day at a
particular hour, and it was in vain that the maiden sisters endeavoured
by every stratagem they could devise, to detain him in-doors at this
appointed time. They were fain to pray for perpetual wet weather, for
storms and fogs, whirlwinds, and other caprices of nature, which might
keep the invalid a prisoner to the house.

But at last even rain and tempest ceased to be of any avail to these
distressed and expectant spinsters, for Maurice de Crespigny insisted
upon inviting Mr. and Mrs. Monckton to Woodlands. They were to come
whenever they could, every day if they could, the old man wrote, with
a tremulous hand that was apt to go a little astray over the paper;
but which was yet strong enough and firm enough to inscribe a decent
signature at the foot of a will.

The two sisters never saw him write without thinking of this document.
Was it made, and made in their favour? Was it yet to make? Or was it
made in accordance with the expectations of Ellen Darrell and her son?

Lavinia and Sarah de Crespigny were agonized by the mere thought of
this latter possibility. It was not the money alone that they thought
of, the lands and tenements alone that they considered. There was the
family house in which they had lived so long, the household treasures
which their own careful hands had dusted, as things too sacred to be
approached by meaner fingers.

There were the old silver salvers, the antique tea and coffee services,
the great dragon-china jars on the staircase, the inlaid card-tables in
the green parlour,—would the ruthless young man come into possession,
and seize even upon those particular household gods which were most
sacred to the maiden sisters?

They knew that they had no claim to any great mercy from Launcelot
Darrell. Had they not urged his Indian voyage, and for ever offended
him by so doing? It would have been better perhaps to have been
friendly towards him, and to have suffered him to remain in England,
and to be as much at Woodlands as he pleased, thereby affording him
ample opportunity for giving offence to his great-uncle.

“Who can count upon an old man’s caprices?” thought the maiden sisters;
“perhaps because our uncle has seen very little of Launcelot, he may be
all the more kindly disposed towards him.”

On the other hand, there was now the more imminent danger of this
sudden fancy with which Eleanor Monckton had inspired the invalid; and
the sisters grew paler and more lugubrious every day as they watched
the progress of this eccentric friendship.

Gilbert Monckton placed no obstacle in the way of his wife’s visits to
Woodlands. He knew how sternly the doors of Mr. de Crespigny’s house
were guarded against his widowed niece and her son; and he knew that
there at least Eleanor was not likely to meet Launcelot Darrell.

Mrs. Monckton was therefore free to visit her dead father’s friend when
she pleased; and she was not slow to avail herself of this privilege.
It was of vital importance to her to be on familiar terms with Maurice
de Crespigny, to be able to enter his house when and how she would.
She saw enough in the old man’s face, in the fearful uncertainty of his
health—which one day suffered him to be bright and cheerful, and on
the next laid him prostrate and helpless upon a sick bed—to convince
her that his state was terribly precarious. He might linger for years.
He might die suddenly. He might die, leaving his fortune to Launcelot
Darrell.

The sisters watched, with ever-increasing alarm, the progress that Mrs.
Monckton was making in their uncle’s favour. The old man seemed to
brighten under the influence of Eleanor’s society. He had no glimmering
idea of the truth; he fully believed that the likeness which the
lawyer’s young wife bore to George Vane was one of those accidental
resemblances so common to the experience of every one. He believed
this; and yet in spite of this he felt as if Eleanor’s presence brought
back something of his lost youth. Even his memory was revivified by
the companionship of his dead friend’s daughter; and he would sit for
hours together, talking, as his nieces had not heard him talk in many
monotonous years, telling familiar stories of that past in which George
Vane had figured so prominently.

To Eleanor these old memories were never wearisome; and Maurice de
Crespigny felt the delight of talking to a listener who was really
interested. He was accustomed to the polite attention of his nieces,
whose suppressed yawns sometimes broke in unpleasantly at the very
climax of a story, and whose wooden-faced stolidity had at best
something unpleasantly suggestive of being listened to and stared at
by two Dutch clocks. But he was not accustomed to see a beautiful and
earnest face turned towards him as he spoke; a pair of bright grey eyes
lighting up with new radiance at every crisis in the narrative; and
lovely lips half parted through intensity of interest.

These things the old man was not accustomed to, and he became entirely
Eleanor’s slave and adorer. Indeed, the elderly damsels congratulated
themselves upon Miss Vincent’s marriage with Gilbert Monckton;
otherwise Maurice de Crespigny, being besotted and infatuated, and the
young woman mercenary, there might have been a new mistress brought
home to Woodlands instead of to Tolldale Priory.

Happily for Eleanor, the anxious minds of the maiden sisters were
ultimately set in some degree at rest by a few words which Maurice de
Crespigny let drop in a conversation with Mrs. Monckton. Amongst the
treasures possessed by the old man—the relics of a past life, whose
chief value lay in association—there was one object that was peculiarly
precious to Eleanor. This was a miniature portrait of George Vane, in
the cap and gown which he had worn sixty years before, at Magdalen
College, Oxford.

This picture was very dear to Eleanor Monckton. It was no very
wonderful work of art, perhaps, but a laborious and patient
performance, whose production had cost more time and money than the
photographic representations of half the members of the Lower House
would cost to-day. It showed Eleanor a fair-haired stripling, with
bright hopeful blue eyes. It was the shadow of her dead father’s youth.

Her eyes filled with tears as she looked at the little ivory portrait
in its oval case of slippery red morocco.

“Crocodile!” thought one of the maiden sisters.

“Sycophant!” muttered the other.

But this very miniature gave rise to that speech which had so much
effect in calming the terrors of the two ladies.

“Yes, my dear,” Maurice de Crespigny said; “that portrait was painted
sixty years ago. George Vane would have been close upon eighty if he
had lived. Yes, close upon eighty, my love. You don’t see your own
likeness to that picture, perhaps; people seldom do see resemblances
of that kind. But the lad’s face is like yours, my dear, and you bring
back the memory of my youth, just as the scent of some old-fashioned
flower, that our advanced horticulture has banished to a cottager’s
garden, brings back the grass-plot upon which I played at my mother’s
knees. Do you know what I mean to do, Mrs. Monckton?”

Eleanor lifted her eyebrows with an arch smile, as who should say,
“Your caprices are quite beyond my power of divination.”

“I mean to leave that miniature to you in my will, my dear.”

The maiden sisters started simultaneously, agitated by the same
emotion, and their eyes met.

“Yes, my dear,” Maurice de Crespigny repeated, “I shall leave that
miniature to you when I die. It’s not worth anything intrinsically;
but I don’t want you to be reminded of me when I am dead and gone,
except through your own tender feelings. You have been interested in
my stories of George Vane—who, with all his faults, and I’m not slow
to acknowledge them, was a brighter and better man than I was—and
it may please you sometimes to look at that picture. You’ve brought
a ray of sunlight across a very dismal pathway, my love,” added the
invalid, quite indifferent to the fact that this remark was by no
means complimentary to his devoted nurses and guardians, “and I am
grateful to you. If you were poor, I should leave you money. But you
are the wife of a rich man; and, beyond that, my fortune is already
disposed of. I am not free to leave it as I might wish; I have a duty
to perform, my dear; a duty which I consider sacred and imperative; and
I shall fulfil that duty.”

The old man had never before spoken so freely of his intentions with
regard to his money. The sisters sat staring blankly at each other,
with quickened breaths and pale faces.

What could this speech mean? Why, clearly that the money must be left
to them. What other duty could Maurice de Crespigny owe to any one? Had
they not kept guard over him for years, shutting him in, and separating
him from every living creature? What right had he to be grateful to any
one but them, inasmuch as they had taken good care that no one else
should ever do him a service?

But to the ears of Eleanor Monckton, the old man’s speech had another
signification; the blood mounted to her face, and her heart beat
violently. “He is thinking of Launcelot Darrell,” she thought; “he will
leave his fortune to Launcelot Darrell. He will die before he learns
the secret of my father’s wrongs. His will is already made, no doubt,
and he will die before I can dare to say to him, ‘Your niece’s son is a
trickster and a villain!’”

This was the only occasion upon which Maurice de Crespigny ever spoke
of his intentions with regard to the fortune that he must leave behind
him. He said, plainly enough, that Eleanor was to have none of his
money; and the sisters, who had until now kept a jealous watch upon
the old man and his favourite, were henceforward content to let Mrs.
Monckton come and go as she pleased. But for all this Eleanor was no
nearer the accomplishment of her great purpose.

Launcelot Darrell came to Tolldale, and in a certain easy and somewhat
indifferent manner paid his homage to his affianced wife. Laura was
happy by fits and starts; and by fits and starts utterly miserable,
when the horrible pangs of jealousy—jealousy of Eleanor, and jealous
doubts of her lover’s truth—tortured her breast. Gilbert Monckton
sat day after day in the library or the drawing-room, or Eleanor’s
morning-room, as the case might be, keeping watch over his wife and the
lovers.

But though the days and weeks went by with an unnatural rapidity, as it
seemed to Mrs. Monckton—with a wearisome slowness in the opinion of her
husband—the progress of time brought George Vane’s daughter no further
onward, by so much as one step, upon the pathway which she had chosen
for herself.

Christmas came; and the girl whose youth had been spent in the shabby
lodgings in which her father had hidden the poverty of his decline, the
patient young housekeeper who had been used to eke out ounces of tea,
and to entreat for brief respite and grace from aggrieved chandlers,
was called upon to play my Lady Bountiful at Tolldale Priory, and to
dole out beef and bread, blankets and brandy, coals and flannels, to a
host of hungry and shivering claimants.

Christmas passed, and the new year straggled into life under every
disadvantage of bad weather; while the spring, the dreaded early
spring, which was to witness Laura’s marriage, approached with a
stealthy footfall, creeping day by day nearer and nearer.

Eleanor, in very despair, appealed to Richard Thornton.

She appealed to him from the force of habit, perhaps: as a fretful
child complains to its mother: rather than from any hope that he could
aid her in her great scheme.

“Oh, Richard,” she wrote, despairingly, “help me, help me, help me! I
thought all would be so easy if I could once come to this place. But I
am here, and I see Launcelot Darrell every day, and yet I am no nearer
the end. What am I to do? January is nearly over; and in March, Laura
Mason is to marry that man. Mr. de Crespigny is very ill, and may die
at any moment, leaving his money to his niece’s son. Is this man, who
caused my father’s death, to have all the brightest and best things
this world can give? Is he to have a noble fortune and an amiable wife?
and am I to stand by and permit him to be happy; remembering what
happened upon that dreadful night in Paris—remembering that my father
lies in his unconsecrated grave, and that his blood is upon this man’s
head? Help me, Richard. Come to me; help me to find proof positive of
Launcelot Darrell’s guilt. You can help me, if you please. Your brain
is clearer, your perception quicker, than mine. I am carried away by my
own passion—blinded by my indignation. You were right when you said I
should never succeed in this work. I look to you to avenge my father’s
death.”




CHAPTER XXXI.

A POWERFUL ALLY.


Richard Thornton was not slow to respond to Eleanor’s summons. The same
post which carried Mrs. Monckton’s letter to the young man conveyed
another letter, addressed to the Signora, urging her to abandon her
pupils, for a time at least, and to come at once to Tolldale.

Eleanor had not forgotten the faithful friends who had succoured her
in the day of her desolation, but the Signora’s habits of independence
were not to be conquered, and Mrs. Monckton found there was very little
that Eliza Picirillo would consent to accept from her.

She had insisted upon removing the music-mistress from the eccentric
regions of the Pilasters to a comfortable first-floor in Dudley Street.
She had furnished this new shelter with easy chairs, and Brussels
carpets, an Erard’s piano, and proof impressions of the Signora’s
favourite pictures; and in doing this she had very nearly exhausted
her first year’s income, much to the satisfaction of Gilbert Monckton,
who implored her to call upon him freely for any money she might want
for her friends.

It pleased him to see her do these things. It was a delight to him to
see her thus tenderly grateful to the friends of her adversity.

“A mercenary woman would have cast off these humble associations,” he
thought: “this girl must be the noble creature I believed her to be,
when I flung down my happiness for the second time at a woman’s feet.”

But although Eleanor would have gladly lavished every shilling
she possessed upon Eliza Picirillo and her nephew, she could not
persuade either the music-mistress or the scene-painter to work less
hard than it had been their wont to do for many wearisome years.
The Signora still went from house to house in attendance upon her
out-of-door pupils, and still received young ladies bent upon wearing
the laurel crown of the lyric drama. Richard still painted snow-clad
mountain-tops, and impossible Alpine passes, impracticably prosperous
villages, and wide-spreading farm-lands of yellow corn, bounded by
fragile white palings, and occupied by husbandmen in linen gaiters and
chintz waistcoats. It was in vain, therefore, that Mrs. Monckton had
hitherto implored her friends to come to Tolldale, and it was only in
consequence of a very serious misunderstanding with Messrs. Spavin and
Cromshaw, which for a time threw the scene-painter out of employment,
that Richard Thornton was able to respond to Eleanor’s earnest appeal.

A January that had been bleaker and colder than even January is
expected to be was drawing to a close, when Signora Picirillo and her
nephew arrived at the Priory. The woods round Tolldale were shrouded
with snow, the broad lawns before Woodlands were as white as Richard’s
Alpine passes, and Maurice de Crespigny had been for many weeks a
prisoner to the house. Laura’s wedding-day was appointed for the
fifteenth of March, and that young lady, when unoccupied by her lover’s
society, was entirely absorbed in the millinery and mantua-making
necessary for the preparation of her bridal outfit.

Richard Thornton had considerably modified the eccentric fashion of his
beard and had bought a new suit of clothes in honour of his fair young
hostess. The scene-painter had not seen Eleanor since the morning on
which he had fled away from the Pilasters to hide his sorrows amongst
the swamps of Battersea. The meeting, therefore, was a painful one to
him; all the more painful, perhaps, because Mrs. Monckton received him
with the frankly affectionate welcome which she would have bestowed
upon a brother.

“You must help me, Dick,” she said, “for the sake of others, if not
for my sake; you cannot now refuse to fathom this mystery. If Launcelot
Darrell is the man I believe him to be, he is no fit husband for an
affectionate and trusting girl. He has no right to inherit Maurice de
Crespigny’s fortune! The marriage between Laura and this man is to
take place upon the fifteenth of March. Maurice de Crespigny may die
to-morrow. We have very little time before us, Richard.”

So Mr. Thornton was fain to obey the imperious young lady, who had been
in the habit of ordering him about ever since the days in which he had
kept rabbits and silkworms for her gratification. He set himself to
his task very faithfully; and did his best to become acquainted with
Launcelot Darrell’s character.

The well-born young artist, who meant to do something very great in the
Academy at his earliest convenience, treated the scene-painter with a
supercilious good-nature that was by no means agreeable to Mr. Thornton.

Dick had resolved _not_ to be prejudiced against Eleanor’s fancied
enemy, lest that young lady’s vehement impulses should have led her
into rather an awkward mistake; but there was something in the insolent
assurance of Launcelot Darrell that aroused Richard’s indignation, and
it was not without an effort that he contrived to be commonly civil to
poor Laura’s affianced husband.

Launcelot dined at Tolldale upon the evening of the arrival of
Eleanor’s guests, and it was at the dinner-table that Richard first had
an opportunity of observing the man he had been entreated to watch.
Mr. Monckton, sitting at the bottom of the table, and looking at his
wife athwart a glittering array of glass and silver, became aware of a
change in Eleanor’s manner, a change that mystified and bewildered him,
but which was not altogether unpleasant to him.

The lawyer’s jealousy had been chiefly aroused by the perpetual
uneasiness of Eleanor’s manner when Launcelot Darrell was present; by
the furtive yet unregarded watch which she kept upon the young man’s
movements. To-night, for the first time, her manner had changed. It was
no longer Launcelot Darrell, but Richard Thornton whom she watched.

Following every varying expression of her face, Gilbert Monckton saw
that she looked at the scene-painter with an earnest, questioning,
appealing glance, that seemed to demand something of him, or urge him
on to the performance of something that she wanted done. Looking from
his wife to Richard, the lawyer saw that Launcelot Darrell was still
watched; but this time the eyes that observed him were those of the
Signora’s nephew.

Mr. Monckton felt very much like a spectator who looks on at a drama
which is being acted in a language that is unknown to him. The
_dramatis personæ_ come in and go out; they are earnest or vehement,
joyous or sorrowful, as the case may be; but not having any clue to the
plot, the wretched looker-on can scarcely feel intense delight in the
performance.

Eleanor contrived to question her ally in the course of the evening.

“Well, Richard,” she said, “is Launcelot Darrell the man who cheated my
father?”

“I don’t know about that, Mrs. Monckton, but——”

“But you think——?”

“I think he is by no means the most delightful, or the best of men. He
snubs me because I paint scenery for the Phœnix; and he accepts that
silly little girl’s homage with the air of a sultan.”

“Then you don’t like him, Dick!”

Mr. Thornton drew a long breath, as if by some powerful effort of his
will he repressed a vehement and unseemly expression of feeling.

“I think he’s—you know what a great tragedian used to call people when
they rang down the act-drop three minutes before Lear had finished
using bad language to his eldest daughter, or came up in the witches’
cauldron with their backs to the audience—and nervous people have been
known to do that, Eleanor:—it isn’t pleasant to stand on a rickety
ladder and talk to a quick-tempered tragedian out of a canvas saucepan,
with a smell of burning rosin in your nostrils, and another nervous
apparition wanting to get you off the ladder before you’ve finished
your speech. I think Launcelot Darrell is—a BEAST, Mrs. Monckton; and I
have no doubt he would cheat at cards, if he had the chance of doing it
with perfect safety and convenience.”

“You think that?” cried Eleanor, seizing upon this latter part of
Richard’s speech; “you think that he would cheat a helpless old man?
Prove that, Richard; prove it, and I will be as merciless to Launcelot
Darrell as he was to my father—his uncle’s friend, too; he knew that.”

“Eleanor Monckton,” Richard said, earnestly, “I have never been
serious before upon this matter; I have hoped that you would outlive
your girlish resolution; I hoped above all that when you married”—his
voice trembled a little here, but he went bravely on—“new duties would
make you forget that old promise; and I did my best, Heaven knows,
to wean you from the infatuation. But now that I have seen this man,
Launcelot Darrell, it seems to me as if there may have been something
of inspiration in your sudden recognition of him. I have already seen
enough of him to know at least that he is no fit husband for that poor
little romantic girl with the primrose-coloured ringlets; and I will do
my best to find out where he was, and what he was doing, during those
years in which he is supposed to have been in India.”

“You will do this, Richard?”

“Yes, Mrs. Monckton.” The young man addressed his old companion by this
name, using the unfamiliar appellation as a species of rod by which he
kept in order and subdued certain rebellious emotions that would arise
as he remembered how utterly the beautiful girl, whose presence had
made sunshine in the shabbiest, if not the shadiest of places, was now
lost to him. “Yes, Mrs. Monckton, I will try and fathom the mystery.
This Launcelot Darrell must be very clever if he can have contrived to
do away with every vestige of the years in which he was or was not in
India. However softly Time may tread, he leaves his footmarks behind
him; and it will be strange if we can’t find some tell-tale impression
whereby Mr. Darrell’s secret may be discovered. By the bye, Mrs.
Monckton, you have had a good deal of time for observation. What have
you done towards investigating the young man’s antecedents?”

Eleanor blushed, and hesitated a little before she answered this very
direct question.

“I have watched him very closely,” she said, “and I’ve listened to
every word he has ever said——”

“To be sure. In the expectation, no doubt, that he would betray himself
by frowns and scowls, and other facial contortions, after the manner of
a stage villain; or that he would say, ‘At such a time I was in Paris;’
or ‘At such a time I cheated at _écarté_.’ You go cleverly to work,
Mrs. Monckton, for an amateur detective!”

“What ought I to have done, then?” Eleanor asked, despondently.

“You should have endeavoured to trace up the history of the past by
those evidences which the progress of life can scarcely fail to leave
behind it. Watch the man’s habits and associations, rather than the man
himself. Have you had access to the rooms in which he lives?”

“Yes; I have been with Laura to Hazlewood often since I came here. I
have been in Launcelot Darrell’s rooms.”

“And have you seen nothing there? no book, no letter; no scrap of
evidence that might make one link in the story of this man’s life?”

“Nothing—nothing particular. He has some French novels on a shelf in
one corner of his sitting-room.”

“Yes; but the possession of a few French novels scarcely proves that he
was in Paris in the year ’53. Did you look at the titles of the books?”

“No; what could I have gained by seeing them?”

“Something, perhaps. The French are a volatile people. The fashion
of one year is not the fashion of another. If you had found some work
that made a _furore_ in that particular year, you might have argued
that Launcelot Darrell was a _flâneur_ in the Galerie d’Orleans, or on
the Boulevard, where the book was newly exhibited in the shop-windows.
If the novels were new ones, and not Michel Lévy’s eternal reprints of
Sand and Soulié, Balzac and Bernard, you might have learnt something
from them. The science of detection, Mrs. Monckton, lies in the
observation of insignificant things. It is a species of mental geology.
A geologist looks into the gravel pit, and tells you the history of the
creation; a clever detective ransacks a man’s carpet-bag, and convicts
that man of a murder or a forgery.”

“I know I have been very stupid,” Eleanor murmured, almost piteously.

“Heaven forbid that you should ever be very clever in such a line
as this. There must be detective officers; they are the polished
bloodhounds of our civilized age, and very noble and estimable animals
when they do their duty conscientiously: but fair-haired young ladies
should be kept out of this _galère_. Think no more of this business,
then, Eleanor. If Launcelot Darrell was the man who played _écarté_
with your father on the 11th of August, ’53, I’ll find a proof of his
guilt. Trust me to do that.”

“I will trust you, Richard.”

Mrs. Monckton held out her hand with a certain queenliness of gesture,
as if she would thereby have ratified a bond between herself and her
old friend; and as the flower of bygone chivalry were wont to vow the
accomplishment of great deeds on the jewelled hilt of a cross-handled
sword, so Richard Thornton, bending his honest head, swore allegiance
upon the hand of Gilbert Monckton’s young wife.

“One word more, Mrs. Monckton,” said the scene-painter, “and then we
had better leave off talking, or people will begin to wonder why we
are so confidential and mysterious. This Mr. Darrell is an artist, I
understand. Does he paint much?”

“Oh, yes, a great deal; that is to say, he begins a great many things.”

“Precisely; he does a good many rough sketches, scraps of pencil and
crayon, eh?”

“And he fills portfolios with such scrape, and litters his studio with
them?”

“Yes.”

“Then I must have a look at his studio, Mrs. Monckton. An artist—yes,
even the poorest artist, the furthest away from the sublimity of
genius—is sure to be fond of his art. He makes a confidant of it; he
betrays a hundred secrets, that he keeps locked from every living
creature, in the freedom of his studio. His pencil is the outer
expression of his mind; and whatever falsehoods he may impose upon his
fellow-men, his sketch-book will tell the truth. It will betray him
when he is false, and reveal him when he is true. I must have a look
at Launcelot Darrell’s studio, Mrs. Monckton. Let me see the man’s
pictures; and I may be able to tell you more about the man, himself.”




CHAPTER XXXII.

THE TESTIMONY OF THE SKETCH-BOOK.


It is only natural that one painter should take an interest in the
work of another. Mr. Darrell testified no surprise, therefore, when
Richard Thornton appeared at Hazlewood the morning after his arrival at
Tolldale, under convoy of Mrs. Monckton and Laura.

“I’ve come to say how sorry I was at your not coming to dinner last
night, dear Mrs. Darrell,” Laura said, to the lady who was so soon
to be her mother-in-law; “and I want to ask you whether I ought to
have the sprigged muslin morning dresses trimmed with pink or blue,
or whether I ought to have three of them pink and three blue, for
Launcelot might get tired of seeing me in the same colours, you know,
and I might have two of them trimmed with peach, if it came to that;
and Eleanor has come with me; and Mr. Thornton—Mr. Thornton, Mrs.
Darrell; Mrs. Darrell, Mr. Thornton—has come too, because he is an
artist and wants to see Launcelot’s pictures—especially the beautiful
picture that’s going into the Academy, and that the committee is sure
to hang on the line; and I’m sure Launcelot will let Mr. Thornton see
his studio—won’t you, dear Launcelot?”

Miss Mason pursed up her rosy lips, and put her head on one side like
an insinuating canary, as she addressed her affianced husband. She
looked very pretty in her winter costume, with a good deal of rich
brown fur about her, and a dash of scarlet here and there. She looked
like a fashionably-dressed Red Ridinghood, simple enough to be deluded
by the weakest-minded of wolves. She was so pretty that her lover
glanced down at her with a gratified smile, deriving considerable
pleasure from the idea that she belonged to him, and that she was, on
the whole, something to be rather proud of; something that added to the
young sultan’s dignity, and bore testimony to his supreme merits.

Eleanor looked at the lovers with a contemptuous curve lifting her firm
upper lip. She despised Launcelot Darrell so utterly, that she was
almost cruel enough to despise Laura for loving him.

“Yes,” she thought, “Mr. Monckton is right. Shallow, selfish, and
frivolous! He is all these, and he is false as well. Heaven help you,
Laura, if I cannot save you from a marriage with this man.”

Mr. Darrell was very well pleased to do the honours of his studio
to Richard Thornton. It would be quite a new sort of thing to this
scene-painting fellow, the embryo Academician thought: the poor devil
would pick up fresh ideas, and get a glimpse at the higher regions of
art, for the first time in his life perhaps.

Launcelot Darrell led the way to that pleasant, prettily furnished,
room which he called his studio. The “Rosalind and Celia” still
occupied the post of honour on the easel. Mr. Darrell worked very
hard; but in that spasmodic fashion which is antagonistic to anything
like progress. The enthusiasm which upon one occasion kept him at his
picture long after the fading light had given him notice to leave it,
entirely deserted him upon another; and was perhaps followed by a fit
of disgust with himself and with his art, which kept him idle for weeks
together.

He made a merit of this fitfulness, depreciating a power of steady and
persistent labour as the faculty of a tradesman, rather than an artist.
He took credit to himself for the long pauses of idleness in which he
waited for what he called inspiration; and imposed upon his mother by
his grand talk about earnestness, conscientiousness, reverence for
the sublimity of art, and a great many more fine phrases by which
he contrived to excuse the simple fact of his laziness. So Eleanor
Vane, as sorrowful _Rosalind_, still smiled sadly upon a simpering
_Celia_:—it had been quite impossible to prevent Miss Mason’s assuming
the conventional simper of the weak-minded sitter who can’t forget
that his portrait is being taken, and that he is in the very act of
handing down his smile to posterity, or to the furniture brokers—out
of an unfinished background, and clad in robes of unfinished satin and
velvet. Mr. Thornton wondered as he looked at the young man’s work, and
remembered how many miles of canvas it had been his own fate to cover
since first he had handled his brushes and splashed in sky borders and
cloud pieces for the chief scene-painter at the Phœnix.

Launcelot Darrell, with his mahlstick in his hand, smiled with sublime
patronage upon Eleanor’s humble friend.

“This sort of thing is rather different to what you’ve been used to,
I suppose?” he said; “rather another kind of work than your pantomime
scenes, your grots of everlasting bliss, and caves of constant content,
where the waterfalls are spangles sewn upon white tape, and the
cloudless skies are blue gauze and silver foil?”

“But we’re not always painting transformations, you know,” Mr. Thornton
answered, in nowise offended by the artist’s graceful insolence;
“scene-painting isn’t _all_ done with Dutch metal and the glue-pot:
we’re obliged to know a little about perspective, and to have a slight
knowledge of colour. Some of my brotherhood have turned out tolerable
landscape-painters, Mr. Darrell. By the bye, you don’t do anything in
the way of landscape, do you?”

“Yes,” Launcelot Darrell answered, indifferently, “I used to try my
hand at landscape; but human interest, human interest, Mr. Thornton, is
the strong point of a picture. To my mind a picture should be a story,
a drama, a tragedy, a poem—something that explains itself without any
help from a catalogue.”

“Precisely. An epic upon a Bishop’s half-length,” Richard Thornton
answered, rather absently. He saw Eleanor’s watchful eyes fixed upon
him, and knew that with every moment she was losing faith in him.
Looking round the room he saw, too, that there were a couple of bloated
portfolios leaning against the wall, and running over with sheets of
dirty Bristol board and crumpled drawing paper.

“Yes,” Launcelot Darrell repeated, “I have tried my hand at landscape.
There are a few in one of those portfolios—the upper one, I think—not
the purple one; I keep private memoranda and scraps in that. The green
portfolio, Mr. Thornton; you may find some things there that will
interest you—that might be useful to you, perhaps.”

The artist threw down his mahlstick, and strolled across the room to
talk to Laura Mason and his mother, who were sitting near the fire. In
doing this he left Eleanor and Richard side by side, near the easel and
the corner in which the portfolios leaned against the wall.

There was a large old-fashioned window in this corner of the room, the
casement against which Eleanor had stood when Launcelot Darrell asked
her to be his wife. The window was in a deep recess, shaded by thick
crimson curtains, and in the recess there was a table. Any one sitting
at this table was almost concealed from the other inmates of the room.

Richard Thornton lifted both the portfolios, and placed them on this
table. Eleanor stood beside him, breathless and expectant.

“The purple portfolio contains private memoranda,” whispered the young
man; “it is in that portfolio we must look, Mrs. Monckton. There is no
such thing as honour on the road we have chosen for ourselves.”

The scene-painter untied the strings of the loaded scrap-book, and
flung it open. A chaotic mass of drawings lay before him. Crayon
sketches; pencil scraps; unfinished and finished water-coloured
drawings; rough caricatures in pen-and-ink, and in water-colours;
faint indications of half-obliterated subjects; heads, profiles, chins,
and noses; lithographed costumes; prints; etchings; illustrations
torn out of books and newspapers; all flung together in bewildering
confusion.

Mr. Thornton, seated at the table with his head bent over the papers
before him, and with Eleanor standing at his shoulder, began steadily
and deliberately to examine the contents of this purple portfolio.

He carefully scrutinized each drawing, however slight, however roughly
done, however unpretentious. He looked also at the back of each
drawing, sometimes finding a blank, sometimes a faint pencil indication
of a rubbed-out sketch, or a rough outline in pen-and-ink.

For a long time he found nothing in which the utmost ingenuity could
discover any relation to that period of Launcelot Darrell’s existence
which Eleanor believed to have been spent in Paris.

“Belisarius. Girl with basket of strawberries. Marie Antoinette.
Headsman. Flower-girl. Oliver Cromwell refusing the crown. Oliver
Cromwell denouncing Sir Harry Vane. Oliver Cromwell and his daughters.
Fairfax,” — muttered Richard, as he looked over the sketches. “Didn’t
I tell you, Eleanor, that a man’s sketch-book contains the record of
his life? These Cromwell drawings are all dated in the same year.
Nearly ten years ago; that is to say, when Mr. Darrell had very little
knowledge of anatomy, and a tremendous passion for republicanism.
Further on we come to a pastoral strata, you see. The Watermill: Rosa.
There is a perpetual recurrence of Rosa and the Watermill; Rosa in a
bridal dress; the mill by moonlight; Rosa in a russet cloak; the mill
in a thunderstorm: Rosa sad; the mill at sunset; and the series bears
date two years later, when the artist was desperately in love with a
rustic beauty in this neighbourhood. Now we lose sight of Rosa, and
come upon a Roman period; the artist goes in for the grand and classic.
The Roman period lasts a very short time. Now we are in London; yes, we
are up to our eyes in student life in the metropolis. Here are sketches
of artist existence in Clipstone Street and the purlieus of Fitzroy
Square. Here is the Haymarket by night. An opera-box. Lady Clara Vere
de Vere. Lady Clara at the flower-show—in Hyde Park—at a concert. Aha!
the artist is in love again; and this time the beauty is highborn and
unapproachable. Here are pen-and-ink hints at contemplated suicide; a
young man lying on a pallet bed, an empty bottle on the floor labelled
Prussic Acid; the same young man leaning over the parapet of Waterloo
Bridge on a moonlit night, with St. Paul’s in the background. Yes,
there have been wasted love and despair, and a wild yearning for death,
and that generally morbid and unpleasant state of mind which is the
common result of idleness and strong liquors. Stay!” cried Richard
Thornton, suddenly, “we’re all wrong here.”

“What do you mean?” asked Eleanor. She had watched the young man’s
examination of the drawings with eager interest, with ever-increasing
impatience, in her desire to come to something that should be evidence
against Launcelot Darrell.

“What do you mean?” she said, and then she added, impatiently, “How
slow you are, Dick! What do I want to know of this man except the one
proof that will identify him with that man upon the Boulevard?”

“I’m afraid we’ve been making a mistake all this time,” Richard said,
in rather a despondent tone. “These sketches must have been done by
some companion of Mr. Darrell’s. I’m afraid they’re none of them his.”

“Not his? But why—why not?”

“Because the first lot, the Cromwells and the Rosas, are all signed
with a flourishing autograph—‘Launcelot Darrell, pinxt.,’ in full, as
if the young man was rather proud of his name.”

“Yes, yes; but what then?”

“The London-life sketches, the Lady Claras, and the suicides, which are
much better than the first lot, though I should have thought they had
been by the same man, are all signed with a monogram.”

“A monogram?”

“Yes, of two initials. I’ve been trying to make them out for ever so
long, and I’ve only just succeeded. The two letters are R. L.”

Richard Thornton felt Eleanor’s hand, which had been resting lightly
upon the back of his chair, tighten suddenly upon the rosewood
scroll-work; he heard her breath grow quicker; and when he turned his
head he saw that she was deadly pale.

“It is coming home to him, Richard,” she said. “The man who cheated my
father called himself ‘Robert Lan—’ Part of the name was torn away in
my father’s letter, but the initials of that false name are R. L. Go
on, Dick; go on quickly, for pity’s sake; we shall find something more
presently.”

Eleanor Monckton had spoken in a whisper, but at this moment the
scene-painter laid his hand upon her wrist and reminded her by a
gesture of the need of caution. But Mr. Darrell, and the two ladies
at the other end of the roomy studio, were in no manner observant of
anything that might be going on in the curtained recess of the window.
Laura was talking, and her lover was laughing at her; half pleased,
half amused, by her childish frivolity.

Richard Thornton turned over a heap of sketches without speaking.

But presently he came upon a water-colour drawing of a long lamplit
street, crowded with figures in grotesque costumes, and with masks upon
their faces.

“We have crossed the Channel, Eleanor,” he said. “Here is Paris in
Carnival time, and here is the assumed name, too, in full,—‘Robert
Lance, March 2nd, ’53.’ Be quiet, Eleanor, be calm, for Heaven’s sake.
The man is guilty; I believe that, now, as fully as you do; but we have
to bring his guilt home to him.”

“Keep that sketch, Richard,” whispered the girl, “keep it. It is the
proof of his false name. It is the proof that he was in Paris when he
was believed to be in India. It is the proof that he was in Paris a few
months before my father’s death.”

The scene-painter folded the tumbled sheet of drawing-paper and thrust
it into the breast-pocket of his loose overcoat.

“Go on, Richard; go on,” said Eleanor; “there may be something more
than this.”

The young man obeyed his eager companion; one by one he looked at the
pen-and-ink sketches, the crayon drawings, the unfinished scraps in
Indian ink or water-colour.

They all bore evidence of a life in Paris and its neighbourhood. Now a
_débardeur_ hanging on the arm of a student; now a grisette drinking
lemonade with an artisan beyond the barrier; a funeral train entering
the gates of Père la Chaise; some children, with garlands in their
hands, kneeling by a grave; a showman on the Boulevard; a group of
Zouaves; a bit of landscape in the forest of Saint Germain, with
equestrian figures beneath an arch of foliage; a scene in the Champs
Elysées.

And at last, a rough pencil sketch of a group in a small chamber at a
_café_; an old man seated at a lamplit table playing _écarté_ with a
man whose face was hidden; an aristocratic-looking, shabby-genteel old
man, whose nervous fingers seemed to clutch restlessly at a little pile
of napoleons on the table before him.

There was a third figure; the figure of a smartly-dressed Frenchman
standing behind the old man’s chair; and in this watcher of the game
Eleanor recognized the man who had persuaded her father to leave her on
the Boulevard,—the companion of the sulky Englishman.

The sketch was dated August 12, 1853; the very day on which Richard
Thornton had recognized the dead man in the ghastly chamber of the
Morgue. On the back of the drawing were written these words, “Sketch
for finished picture, to be called ‘The last of the Napoleons’—Robert
Lance.”

The likeness of the principal figure to George Vane was unmistakable.
The man who had been heartless enough to cheat his kinsman’s friend,
had made this record of the scene of his cruelty; but had not been so
callous as to carry out his design after the suicide of his victim.




CHAPTER XXXIII.

MAURICE DE CRESPIGNY’S WILL.


Richard Thornton folded the pencil sketch and put it in his pocket with
the water-coloured drawing.

“I told you that Launcelot Darrell would make a confidant of his
pencil,” he said, in a low voice. “We may as well tie up the portfolio,
Mrs. Monckton; there will be nothing more in it that can help us. The
memory of your father would scarcely be pleasant to this young man
after the 12th of August. When he made this sketch he had yet to learn
the consequences of what he had done.”

Eleanor stood behind the scene-painter’s chair, silent and motionless.
Her face was pale, and her mouth compressed and rigid with the effort
by which she controlled her agitation. But a flame of fire burned in
her eyes, and her nostrils quivered with a convulsive movement. Mr.
Thornton carefully replaced the sketches in the purple portfolio, tied
the strings, and laid the book in its old place against the wall. Then,
unfastening the green portfolio, he went rapidly through the landscape
scraps which it contained.

“The hand is weak here,” Richard said: “Mr. Launcelot Darrell has no
sympathy with nature. He might be a clever figure painter if he had
as much perseverance as he has talent. His pictures are like himself;
shallow, artificial, and meretricious; but they are clever.”

The scene-painter said this with a purpose. He knew that Eleanor stood
behind him, erect and statuesque, with her hand grasping the back of
his chair, a pale Nemesis bent on revenge and destruction. He wanted,
if possible, to let her down to commonplace feeling, by his commonplace
talk, before Launcelot Darrell saw her face. But, looking round at
that pale young face, Richard saw how terrible was the struggle in the
girl’s breast, and how likely she was at any moment to betray herself.

“Eleanor,” he whispered, “if you want to carry this business to the
end, you must keep your secret. Launcelot Darrell is coming this way.
Remember that an artist is quick to observe. There is the plot of a
tragedy in your face at this moment.”

Mrs. Monckton tried to smile; but the attempt was very feeble; the
smile wan and sickly. Launcelot Darrell came to the curtained recess,
but he was not alone: Laura Mason came with him, talking very fast,
and asking innumerable questions, now turning to her lover, now
appealing to Eleanor or Richard Thornton.

“What a time you’ve been looking over the sketches,” she said, “and how
do you like them, and which do you like best? Do you like the sea-side
bits, or the forest sketches? There’s a picture of Tolldale with the
cupola and the dinner-bell, Eleanor; I like the sketches in the other
portfolio best; Launcelot lets _me_ look at them, though he won’t allow
any one else to see them. But I don’t like Rosa. I’m terribly jealous
of Rosa—yes, I _am_, Launcelot; and it’s not a bit of use telling me
you were never in love with her, and you only admired her because she
was a pretty rustic model. Nobody in the world could believe that,
could they, Mr. Thornton? Could they, Eleanor? When an artist paints
the same face again and again, and again and again, he must be in love
with the original; mustn’t he now?”

Nobody answered the young lady’s eager questions. Launcelot Darrell
smiled and twisted his dark moustache between his slender womanish
fingers. Laura’s unrestrained admiration of him was very agreeable; and
he was beginning to be in love with her, after his own fashion, which
was a very easy one.

Eleanor looked at her husband’s ward with a strange expression in her
face—a stern unpitying gaze, that promised little good to the young
heiress.

“What is this foolish girl’s fancy to me, that it should weigh against
my father’s death?” she thought. “What is it to me that she may have
to suffer? Let me remember the bitterness of his sufferings; let me
remember that long night upon which I watched for him,—that miserable
night in which he despaired and died. Surely the remembrance of this
will shut every thought of pity from my heart.”

Perhaps Eleanor Monckton had need to reason with herself thus. It
might be difficult to be true to her scheme of vengeance, when, in the
path she had to tread, this girl’s heart must be trampled upon; this
innocent, childish, confiding little creature who had clung to her, and
trusted in her, and loved her, from the hour of their first meeting.

“Should I be pitiful, or merciful, or just to her, if I suffered her
to marry a bad man?” Mrs. Monckton asked herself. “No; for her sake,
as much as for the memory of my father, it is my duty to denounce
Launcelot Darrell.”

Throughout the drive back to Tolldale, Mrs. Monckton silently brooded
upon the morning’s work. Richard Thornton had indeed proved a powerful
ally. How often she had been in that studio, and not once had the
idea occurred to her of looking amongst the artist’s sketches for the
evidence of his life.

“I told you that you could help me, Richard,” she said, when she found
herself alone with the scene-painter. “You have given me the proof
which I have waited for so long. I will go to Woodlands to-night.”

“What for?”

“To show those two sketches to Mr. de Crespigny.”

“But will that proof be strong enough to convince a man whose powers
of perception must be weakened by age? What if Mr. de Crespigny should
fail to understand the evidence of those sketches? What if he should
refuse to believe your accusation of his nephew?”

“I will show him my father’s letter.”

“You forget that your father’s letter accuses Robert Lance, and not
Launcelot Darrell.”.

“But the sketches are signed ‘Robert Lance.’”

“And Mr. Darrell may deny his identity with the man who signed himself
by that name. You cannot ask Maurice de Crespigny to believe in his
nephew’s guilt on the testimony of a pencil drawing which that nephew
may boldly repudiate. No, Eleanor, the work of to-day is only one step
upon the road we have to tread. We must be patient, and wait for more
conclusive proof than that which we hold in these two sketches.”

Eleanor sighed wearily.

“And in the meantime the 15th of March may come, or Mr. de Crespigny
may die,” she said. “Oh, let me go to him at once; let me tell him who
I am, and show him my father’s letter; let me tell him the cruel story
of his old friend’s death! He knows nothing but that which he learned
from a brief notice in a newspaper. He _cannot_ refuse to believe me.”

Richard Thornton shook his head.

“You have asked me to help you, Eleanor,” he said, gravely; “if I am
to do so, you must have some faith in my counsel. Wait until we have
fuller power to prove our case, before you reveal yourself to Mr. de
Crespigny.”

Mrs. Monckton could not very well refuse to submit herself to the
scene-painter’s guidance. He had already most decisively demonstrated
the superiority of his deliberate policy, as compared with the
impulsive and unconsidered course of action recklessly followed by a
headstrong girl.

“I must obey you, Dick,” Eleanor said, “because you are so good to me,
and have done so much to prove that you are a great deal wiser than I
am. But if Mr. de Crespigny should die while we are waiting for further
proof, I——”

“You’ll blame me for his death, I suppose, Mrs. Monckton,” interrupted
Richard, with a quiet smile, “after the manner of your sex?”

Eleanor had no little difficulty in obeying her counsellor, for when
Gilbert Monckton met his wife at dinner, he told her that he had been
at Woodlands that morning, and that her friend Maurice de Crespigny was
daily growing weaker, and was not expected to live through the early
spring months.

“The old man is fading slowly away,” the lawyer said. “His quiet and
temperate habits have enabled him to hold out much longer than the
doctors expected. It is like the gradual going out of a candle, they
say. The flame sinks little by little in the socket. You must go and
see the poor old man, Eleanor, before he dies.”

“Before he dies!” repeated Mrs. Monckton, “before he dies! Do you think
he will die very soon, then, or suddenly?”

“Yes, I think he may go off suddenly at last. The medical men say as
much, I understand.”

Eleanor looked at Richard Thornton.

“I must see him, and must see him before he dies,” she said. “Is his
mind unimpaired, Gilbert? Is his intellect still as clear as it was a
week ago?”

“Yes,” answered Mr. Monckton, “I have every reason to believe so; for
while I was talking to the two ladies in the breakfast-parlour, the
chief clerk to Henry Lawford, the Windsor attorney, came in, and asked
me to go up to Mr. de Crespigny’s room. What do you think I was wanted
for, Eleanor?”

“I have no idea.”

“I was wanted to act as witness to the old man’s will, in conjunction
with Lawford’s clerk. It seems the old man had sent to Windsor in a
great hurry for Lawford; but Lawford happened to be out, so his clerk
went instead, and De Crespigny had dictated the will to him. I need
scarcely tell you I was not a little astonished to find that Maurice
de Crespigny had only now made up his mind as to the disposal of
his money. I suppose he has made half-a-dozen wills, and destroyed
one after another according to his humour. I only hope the maiden
sisters may get a decent reward for their long years of patience and
expectation.”

Eleanor’s trembling fingers trifled nervously with the ornaments at
her watch-chain. It was with difficulty that she could control her
agitation.

“But to whom is the fortune left?” she asked, breathlessly. “Did you
hear that, Gilbert?”

“No, my dear, it isn’t usual to make the witness to a will acquainted
with the body of the deed. I saw poor Maurice de Crespigny execute his
feeble autograph, and I put my own muscular-looking signature in the
place indicated to me, and I asked no questions. It was enough for me
to know that _I_ had no interest in the document.”

“But did Mr. de Crespigny say nothing—nothing that could lead you to
guess who——”

“Mr. de Crespigny said nothing whatever calculated to throw any light
upon his intentions. He seemed relieved by the idea that his will
was made and the business settled. The clerk wanted to carry off the
document, but the old man insisted on keeping it in his possession. He
wished to look over it, he said. He wanted to see if his intentions
had been fully carried out, in the spirit as well as in the letter. He
put the parchment under his pillow, and then laid down with an air of
satisfaction. I dare say he has gone through the same little comedy
again and again before to-day.”

“Perhaps he will destroy this will?” Eleanor said, thoughtfully.

“Yes,” Mr. Monckton answered, indifferently, “the old man may change
his mind again, if he lives long enough to repent of this new will. But
I doubt his surviving so long as to do that.”

“And have you no idea, Gilbert,—have you no idea as to whom the fortune
is left?”

Mr. Monckton smiled.

“This is a question that concerns you, Laura,” he said, “a great deal
more nearly than it does us.”

“What question?” asked Miss Mason, looking up from an elaborate piece
of embroidery which she had been showing to Signora Picirillo.

“We are talking of Mr. de Crespigny’s fortune, my dear; you are
interested in the disposal of that, are you not?”

“Oh, yes, of course,” answered the young lady, “I ought to be
interested for Launcelot’s sake, I know; and I know that he ought to
have the fortune, and that nobody has any right to deprive him of it,
especially those nasty old maids who had him sent to India against his
will, and I dare say he will have horrid pains in his liver from the
climate when he’s older. Of course he ought to have the fortune, and
yet sometimes I think it would be nicer for him to be poor. He may
never be a great artist if he’s rich, perhaps; and I’d rather go to
Rome with him and sit by his easel while he works, and pay the hotel
bills, and the travelling expenses, and all that sort of thing, out
of my own money, than have him a country gentleman. I shouldn’t like
him to be a country gentleman; he’d have to hunt, and wear top-boots
and nasty leather gaiters, like a common ploughman, when he went out
shooting. I hate country gentlemen. Byron hasn’t one country gentleman
in all his poems, and that horrid husband in Locksley Hall will show
you what an opinion Tennyson has of them.”

Miss Mason went back to the Signora and the embroidery, satisfied with
having settled the business in her own manner.

“He couldn’t look like the Corsair if he had Woodlands,” she murmured,
despondingly; “he’d have to shave off his moustache if they made him a
magistrate. What would be the good of his talking seriously to poachers
if he wore turned-down collars and loose handkerchiefs round his neck?
People would never respect him unless he was a Guy, with creaky boots,
and big seals hanging to his watch-chain.”

Eleanor pushed the question still further.

“You think that Mr. de Crespigny has left his fortune to Launcelot
Darrell, don’t you, Gilbert?” she asked.

Her husband, prompted by the evil spirit that was his occasional
companion, looked at her, rather suspiciously; but her eyes met his own
with an unfaltering gaze.

“Why are you so interested in this fortune, and in Launcelot Darrell?”
he said.

“I will tell you by-and-by. But tell me now, if you think the estate is
left to Mr. Darrell?”

“I think it scarcely unlikely that it is so. The fact of Maurice de
Crespigny making a fresh will within six months of the young man’s
return looks rather as if he had been led to relent of some previous
determination by the presence of his niece’s son.”

“But Mr. de Crespigny has seen very little of Launcelot Darrell.”

“Perhaps not,” answered Mr. Monckton, coldly. “I may be quite wrong in
my conjecture. You ask for my opinion, and I give it you freely. Pray
let us change the subject. I hate the idea of all this speculation as
to who shall stand in a dead man’s shoes. As far as Launcelot Darrell’s
interests are concerned, I really think there is an undercurrent of
common sense in Laura’s romantic talk. He may be all the better for
being a poor man. He may be all the better for having to go to Italy
and work at his art for a few years.”

Mr. Monckton looked sharply at his young wife as he said this. I rather
think that the demon familiar had prompted this speech, and that the
lawyer watched Eleanor’s face in the desire to discover whether there
was anything unpleasant to her in the idea of Launcelot Darrell’s long
absence from his native country.

But, clever as Gilbert Monckton was, the mystery of his wife’s face was
as yet beyond his power to read. He watched her in vain. The pale and
thoughtful countenance told nothing to the man who wanted the master
key by which alone its expression could be read.




CHAPTER XXXIV.

RICHARD’S DISCOVERY.


An almost ungovernable impulse prompted Eleanor Monckton to make her
way at once into Maurice de Crespigny’s sick-chamber, and say to him,
“Launcelot Darrell is the wretch who caused your old friend’s cruel
death. I call upon you, by the memory of the past, to avenge that dead
friend’s wrongs!”

The struggle was a terrible one, but discretion in the end triumphed,
and Eleanor submitted herself to the guidance of her devoted slave
and ally. She knew now that Launcelot Darrell was guilty; but she had
known that from the moment in which she had seen him lounging in the
Windsor street. The task that lay before her was to procure such proof
as must be convincing to the old man. In spite of her impetuous desire
for immediate action, Eleanor was compelled to acknowledge that the
testimony of the sketch-book was not strong enough in itself to condemn
Launcelot Darrell.

The young man’s answer to any accusation brought against him on such
evidence would be simple enough.

Nothing could be easier than for him to say, “My name is not Robert
Lance. The drawing abstracted by unfair means from my portfolio is not
mine. I am not responsible for the actions of the man who made that
sketch.”

And against this simple declaration there would be nothing but
Eleanor’s unsupported assertion of the identity between the two men.

There was nothing to be done, then, except to follow Richard Thornton’s
advice, and wait.

This waiting was very weary work. Estranged from her husband by the
secret of her life; unhappy in the society of Laura Mason, against
whose happiness she felt that she was, in a manner, plotting;
restrained and ill at ease even in the familiar companionship of Eliza
Picirillo,—Eleanor Monckton wandered about the great rambling mansion
which had become her home, restless and unhappy, yearning with a
terrible impatience for the coming of the end, however dark that end
might be. Every day, and often more than once in the course of the day,
she locked herself in her room, and opened the desk in which she kept
Launcelot Darrell’s sketches and her dead father’s last letter. She
looked at these things almost as if she feared that by some diabolical
influence they might be taken from her before they had served as the
instruments of her revenge. So the weary days wore themselves out.
The first week of Richard’s visit; the second week of Richard’s visit
passed by; the middle of February came, and nothing more had been done.

Eleanor’s health began to suffer from the perpetual mental fever of
anxiety and impatience. Her husband saw her day by day growing thinner
and paler; a hectic flush crimsoned her cheek now at every trifling
agitation, with every surprise, however insignificant; but, except for
these transient flushes, her face was as colourless as marble.

Her husband saw this, and made himself miserable because of the change
in his young wife. He made himself still more wretched by reason of
those unworthy doubts and suspicions that were for ever torturing him.
“Why was Eleanor ill? Why was she unhappy?” He asked himself this
latter question a thousand times a day, and always answered it more or
less after the same fashion.

She was unhappy because of the swiftly approaching marriage between
Laura Mason and Launcelot Darrell. She had opposed that marriage with
all the power she possessed. She had over-estimated her own fortitude
when she sacrificed her love for the young artist to her desire to win
a brilliant position.

“Why should she be different from other women?” the lawyer thought.
“She has married me for my money, and she is sorry for what she has
done, and perhaps upon the eve of poor Laura’s wedding day, there will
be a repetition of the scene that took place at Lausanne nearly twenty
years ago.” This was the manner of meditation to which Mr. Monckton
abandoned himself when the black mood was upon him.

All this time Launcelot Darrell came backwards and forwards between
Hazlewood and Tolldale, after the free-and-easy manner of an accepted
lover, who feels that, whatever advantages he may obtain by the
matrimonial treaty which he is about to form, his own transcendant
merits are so far above every meaner consideration as to render the
lady the gainer by the bargain.

He came, therefore, whenever it pleased him to come. Now dawdling away
a morning over the piano with Laura Mason; now playing billiards with
Richard Thornton, who associated with him as it were under protest,
hating him most cordially all the time.

“The detectives must have a hard time of it,” reflected Mr. Thornton,
after one of these mornings. “Imagine having to hob-and-nob with a
William Palmer, on the chance of his dropping out a word or two that
might help to bring him to the gallows. The profession is extremely
honourable, no doubt, but I don’t think it can be a very pleasant one.
I fancy, upon the whole, a muddy crossing and a good broom must be more
agreeable to a man’s feelings.”

The 15th of February came, dark, cold, and dreary, and Eleanor reminded
the scene-painter that only one month now remained before the day
appointed for Laura’s marriage. That young lady, absorbed amongst a
chaos of ribbons and laces, silks and velvets, had ceased to feel any
jealousy of her guardian’s wife. Her lover’s easy acceptance of her
devotion was sufficient for her happiness. What should the Corsair do
but twist his black moustaches and permit Medora to worship him?

It was on this very 15th of February that, for the first time since
the visit to Launcelot Darrell’s studio, Mr. Richard Thornton made a
discovery.

It was not a very important one, perhaps, nor did it bear directly upon
the secret of the artist’s life, but it was something.

The scene-painter left Tolldale soon after breakfast upon this bleak
February day, in a light dog-cart which Mr. Monckton placed at the
disposal of any guest who might wish to explore the neighbouring
country. Richard did not return until dusk, and he broke in upon
Eleanor’s solitude as the shadows were gathering outside the window of
the room in which she sat. He found his old companion alone in a little
morning-room next her husband’s study. She was sitting on a low stool
by the hearth, her head resting on her hands, and the red firelight on
her face; her attitude altogether expressive of care and despondency.

The door of communication between Gilbert Monckton’s study and the room
in which Eleanor sat was closed.

The girl started and looked up as Richard Thornton opened the door. The
day had been wet as well as cold; drops of rain and sleet hung about
the young man’s rough great-coat, and he brought a damp and chilly
atmosphere into the room.

“Is it you, Richard?” Eleanor said, absently.

“Yes, Mrs. Monckton, I have been out all day; I have been to Windsor.”

“Indeed!”

“Yes. I met Launcelot Darrell there.”

“You met Launcelot Darrell!” repeated Eleanor. “Richard,” she cried,
suddenly, rising as she spoke, and going to where the young man stood,
“you have found something more.”

“I have not found what we want, Eleanor. I have not found the proof
that you must lay before Mr. de Crespigny, when you ask him to leave
his estate away from his nephew. But I think I have made a discovery.”

“What discovery?” asked Mrs. Monckton, with suppressed eagerness. “Do
not speak loudly, Dick,” she added, in a whisper, “my husband is in the
next room. I sit with him sometimes when he is at work there with his
law papers, but I can’t help fancying that my presence annoys him. He
is not the same to me that he used to be. Oh, Richard, Richard, I feel
as if I was divided from every creature in the world, except you: I can
trust you, for you know my secret. When will this end?”

“Very soon, my dear, I hope,” Mr. Thornton answered, gravely. “There
was a time when I urged you to abandon your purpose, Eleanor, but I do
so no longer. Launcelot Darrell is a bad man, and the poor little girl
with the blue eyes and flaxen ringlets must not be suffered to fall
into his power.”

“No, no, not for the world. But you have made some discovery to-day,
Richard?”

“I think so. You remember what Mr. Monckton told us the other day. You
remember his telling us that Mr. de Crespigny had only that day made
his will?”

“Yes, I remember it perfectly.”

“Laura Mason was present when her guardian told us this. It is only
natural she should tell Launcelot Darrell what had happened.”

“She tells him everything; she would be sure to tell him that.”

“Precisely, and Mr. Darrell has not been slow to act upon the hint.”

“What do you mean?”

“I mean that Launcelot Darrell has been guilty of the baseness of
bribing Mr. Lawford’s clerk, in order to find out the secret of the
contents of that will.”

“How do you know this?”

“I discovered it by the merest chance. You owe me no praises, Eleanor.
I begin to think that the science of detection is, after all, very
weak and imperfect; and that the detective officer owes many of his
greatest triumphs to patience, and a series of happy accidents. Yes,
Eleanor, Mr. Launcelot Darrell’s eagerness, or avarice, whichever you
will, would not suffer him to wait until his great-uncle’s death. He
was determined to know the contents of that will; and, whatever the
knowledge may have cost him, I fancy that he is scarcely satisfied with
his bargain.”

“Why?”

“Because I believe that the Woodlands property is not left to him.”

There was a noise as of the movement of a heavy chair in the next room.

“Hush!” Eleanor whispered; “my husband is going to dress for dinner.”

A bell rang while she was speaking, and Richard heard the door of the
next room opened and shut.




CHAPTER XXXV.

WHAT HAPPENED AT WINDSOR.


“Yes,” repeated Richard Thornton, “I have reason to believe that
the will witnessed by your husband is a very unpleasant piece of
literature in the estimation of Launcelot Darrell, for I fancy that
it gives a death-blow to all his expectations, and leaves him without
even the meagre consolation of that solitary shilling which is usually
inherited by unhappy elder sons.”

“But tell me why you think this, Richard.”

“I will, my dear Mrs. Monckton. The story is rather a long one, but I
think I can tell it in a quarter of an hour. Can you dress for dinner
in the other quarter?”

“Oh, yes, yes!”

“What a nuisance civilization is, Nelly. We never dressed for dinner
in the Pilasters; indeed, the fashion amongst the leading families
in that locality leans rather the other way. The gentlemen in the
cab and chimney line generally take off their coats when the mid-day
meal is announced, in order to dine coolly and comfortably in their
shirt-sleeves.”

“Richard, Richard!” cried Eleanor, impatiently.

“Well, well, Mrs. Monckton, seriously, you shall have my Windsor
adventures. I hate this man, Launcelot Darrell, for I believe he is a
shallow, selfish, cold-hearted coxcomb; or else I don’t think I could
have brought myself to do what I’ve done to-day. I’ve been playing
the spy, Eleanor, for a couple of hours at least. The Duke of Otranto
used to find plenty of people for this kind of work—artists, actors,
actresses, priests, women, every creature whom you would least suspect
of baseness. But they manage these things better in France. We don’t
take to the business so readily upon this side of the water.”

“Richard!”

The girl’s impatience was almost uncontrollable. She watched the hands
of a little clock upon the chimney-piece: the firelight flashed every
now and then upon the dial, and then faded out, leaving it dark.

“I’m coming to the story, Nell, if you’ll only be patient,”
remonstrated Mr. Thornton. He was getting over that secret sorrow which
he had nursed for such a long time in the lowest depths of a most true
and faithful breast. He was growing reconciled to the Inevitable, as
we all must, sooner or later; and he had resumed that comfortable
brotherly familiarity which had been so long habitual to him in his
intercourse with Eleanor. “Only be patient, my dear, and let me tell
my story my own way,” he pleaded. “I left here early this morning in
your husband’s dog-cart, intending to drive over to Windsor and amuse
myself by exploring the town, and the castle, if possible, to see if
there was anything in my way to be picked up—donjon keeps, turret
staircases, secret corridors, and so on, you know. You remember what
sort of a morning it was, bleak and dismal enough, but until twelve
o’clock no rain. It was within a quarter of an hour of twelve when I
got into Windsor, and the rain was just beginning, spiteful drops of
rain and particles of sleet, that came down obliquely and cut into your
face like so many needlepoints. I stopped at an inn in a perpendicular
street below the castle, which looks as if it means to topple down
and annihilate that part of the town some of these days. I put up the
dog-cart, and asked a few questions about the possibility of getting
admission to the royal dwelling-place. Of course I was informed that
such admission was to-day utterly impracticable. I could have seen the
state apartments yesterday. I could see them, most likely, by the end
of next week; but I couldn’t see them when I wanted to see them. I
hinted that my chief desire was to see secret passages, donjon keeps,
moats, and sliding panels; but neither the landlord nor the waiter
seemed to understand me, and I sat down rather despondently by the
window of the tavern parlour to wait till the rain was over, and I
could go out and prowl upon the castle terrace to study wintry effects
in the park.”

“But Launcelot Darrell, Richard—where did you meet Launcelot Darrell?”

“I am coming to him presently. The perpendicular street wasn’t
particularly lively upon this wretched February day; so, as there
weren’t any passers-by to look at, I amused myself by looking at the
houses facing the inn. Immediately opposite to me there was a house
very superior to the others in style—a red brick house of the Georgian
era, modernized by plate-glass windows and green blinds—not a large
house, but eminently respectable. A dazzling brass plate adorned the
door, and upon this brass plate, which winked and twinkled in the very
face of the rain, I read the name of Mr. Henry Lawford, solicitor.”

“The lawyer whose clerk made Mr. de Crespigny’s will?”

“Precisely. Upon one side of the door there was a bell-handle inscribed
‘Visitors,’ on the other a duplicate handle inscribed ‘Office.’ I
hadn’t been looking at the house above five minutes, when a young man,
with a slender silk umbrella, struggling against the wind, rang the
office-bell.”

“The young man was Launcelot Darrell?” Eleanor cried, quickly.

“He was. The door was opened by a boy, of whom Mr. Darrell asked
several questions. Whatever the answers were, he walked away, and
the door was shut. But from his manner of strolling slowly along the
street, I was convinced that he was not going far, and that he meant
to come back. People don’t usually stroll in a sharp rain that comes
down obliquely and seems to drift in your face from every point of the
compass. He’ll come back presently, I thought; so I ordered a bottle of
pale ale, and I waited.”

“And he came back?”

“Yes, he came back in about half an hour; but, ten minutes or so
before he returned, I saw a shabby-genteel, elderly man let himself
in with a latch-key at a small green side door with ‘Clerks’ Office’
painted in white letters on the panel. I knew by the look of this man
that he must be a clerk. There’s a look about an attorney’s clerk that
you can’t mistake, even when he doesn’t carry a blue bag; and this man
did carry one. Ten minutes afterwards Launcelot Darrell returned. This
time he knocked with the handle of his umbrella at the green door,
which was opened by the boy, who went to fetch the elderly clerk.
This elderly clerk and Mr. Darrell stood on the door-step talking
confidentially for about five minutes, and then our friend the artist
went away: but this time again strolled slowly through the rain; as if
he had a certain interval to dispose of, and scarcely knew what to do
with himself.

“I suppose the amateur detective business fills a man’s mind with all
manner of suspicious fancies, Eleanor. However that may be, I could
not help thinking that there was something queer in these two visits
of Launcelot Darrell to the red brick house opposite me. What did he
want with a lawyer in the first place? and if he did want a lawyer, why
didn’t he go straight to Mr. Lawford, who was at home—for I could see
his head across the top of the wire blind in one of the plate-glass
windows as he bent over his desk—instead of tampering with small boys
and clerks? There was something mysterious in the manner of his hanging
about the place; and as I had been watching him wearily for a long time
without being able to find out anything mysterious in his conduct, I
determined to make the most of my chances and watch him to some purpose
to-day.

“‘He’ll come back,’ I thought, ‘unless I’m very much mistaken.’

“I was very much mistaken, for Launcelot Darrell did not come back; but
a few minutes after the clock struck one, the green door opened, and
the elderly clerk came out, without the blue bag this time, and walked
nimbly up the street in the direction that Launcelot Darrell had taken.

“‘He’s going to his dinner,’ I thought, ‘or he’s going to meet
Launcelot Darrell.’

“I put on my hat, and went out of the house. The clerk was toiling up
the perpendicular street a good way ahead of me, but I managed to keep
him in sight and to be close upon his heels when he turned the corner
into the street below the towers of the castle. He walked a little way
along this street, and then went into one of the principal hotels.

“‘Ah, my friend!’ I said to myself, ‘you don’t ordinarily take your
dinner at that house, I imagine. It’s a cut above your requirements, I
should think.’

“I went into the hotel, and made my way to the coffee-room. Mr.
Launcelot Darrell and the shabby-genteel clerk were sitting at a table,
drinking sherry and soda-water. The artist was talking to his companion
in a low voice, and very earnestly. It was not difficult to see that he
was trying to persuade the seedy clerk to something which the clerk’s
sense of caution revolted from. Both men looked up as I went into the
room, which they had had all to themselves until that moment; and
Launcelot Darrell flushed scarlet as he recognized me. It was evident,
therefore, that he did not care to be seen in the company of Mr.
Lawford’s clerk.

“‘Good morning, Mr. Darrell,’ I said; ‘I’ve come over to have a look
at the castle, but I find strangers are not admitted to-day, so I’m
obliged to content myself with walking about in the wet for an hour or
two.’

“Launcelot Darrell answered me in that patronizing manner which renders
him so delightful to the people he considers inferior to himself. He
had quite recovered from the confusion my sudden appearance had caused,
and muttered something about Mr. Lawford, the attorney, and ‘business.’
Then he sat biting his nails in an uncomfortable and restless manner,
while I drank another bottle of pale ale. That’s another objection to
the detective business; it involves such a lot of drinking.

“I left the hotel, and left Mr. Darrell and the clerk together; but
I didn’t go very far. I contrived somehow or other to be especially
interested in that part of the exterior of the castle visible from the
street in which the hotel is situated, and, in a manner, kept one eye
upon the stately towers of the royal residence, and the other upon
the doorway out of which Launcelot Darrell and Mr. Lawford’s clerk
must by-and-by emerge. In about half-an-hour I had the satisfaction of
seeing them appear, and contrived, most innocently, of course, to throw
myself exactly in their way at the corner of the perpendicular street.

“I was amply rewarded for any trouble I had taken; for I never saw a
face that so plainly expressed rage, mortification, disappointment,
almost despair, as did the face of Launcelot Darrell, when I came
against him at the street corner. He was as white as a sheet, and he
scowled at me savagely as he passed me by. Not as if he recognized me;
the fixed look in his face showed that his mind was too much absorbed
by one thought for any consciousness of exterior things; but as if
in his suppressed fury he was ready to go blindly against anybody or
anything that came in his way.”

“But why, Richard, why was he so angry?” cried Eleanor, with her hands
clenched and her nostrils quivering with the passage of her rapid
breath. “What does it all mean?”

“Unless I’m very much mistaken, Mrs. Monckton, it means that Launcelot
Darrell has been tampering with the clerk of the lawyer who drew up
Mr. de Crespigny’s last will, and that he now knows the worst——”

“And that is——”

“The plain fact, that unless that will is altered the brilliant Mr.
Darrell will not inherit a penny of his kinsman’s fortune.”

The second dinner-bell rang while Richard was speaking, and Eleanor
ran away to make some hurried change in her toilette, and to appear
in the drawing-room, agitated and ill at ease, ten minutes after Mr.
Monckton’s punctilious butler had made his formal announcement of the
principal meal of the day.




CHAPTER XXXVI.

ANOTHER RECOGNITION.


Lancelot Darrell came to Tolldale Priory upon the day after Richard’s
visit to Windsor, and it was easy for Eleanor, assisted by her
knowledge of what had transpired, to see the change in his manner.
She spent an hour in the drawing-room that morning for the purpose of
seeing this change, and thereby finding confirmation of that which
Richard Thornton had told her. But the alteration in the young man’s
manner must have been very obvious, for even Laura, who was not
particularly observant of any shades of feeling that did not make
themselves manifest by the outward expression of word or gesture,
perceived that there was something amiss with her lover, and drove
Launcelot Darrell well-nigh mad with her childish questionings and
lamentations.

Why was he so quiet? Why was he so much paler than usual? Why did he
sigh sometimes? Why did he laugh in that strange way? Oh, no, not in
his usual way. It was no use saying that it was so. Had he a headache?
Had he been sitting up late at night? Had he been drinking horrid wine
that had disagreed with him? Had he been a naughty, naughty, cruel,
false, treacherous boy, and had he been to some party that he hadn’t
told his poor Laura about, drinking champagne and flirting with girls,
and dancing, and all that? Or had he been working too much at his new
picture?

With such questions as these did the young lady harass and torment her
lover throughout that uncomfortable February morning; until at last Mr.
Darrell turned upon her in a rage, declaring that his head was nearly
split asunder, and plainly telling her to hold her tongue.

Indeed, Mr. Launcelot Darrell made very little effort to disguise his
feelings, but sat over the fire in a low easy chair, with his elbows
resting on his knees, and his handsome dark eyes bent moodily upon the
blaze. He roused himself now and then from a fit of gloomy thought to
snatch up the polished-steel poker, and plunge it savagely amongst the
coals, as if it was some relief to him to punish even them. Another
man might have feared the inferences which spectators might draw from
his conduct, but the principle upon which Launcelot Darrell’s life had
been based involved an utter contempt for almost every living creature
except himself, and he apprehended no danger from the watchfulness of
the inferior beings about him.

Laura Mason, sitting on a low ottoman at his feet, and employed in
working a pair of embroidered slippers—the third pair she had begun
for the use of her future lord and master—thought him more like the
Corsair to-day than ever; but thought at the same time that some
periods of Medora’s existence must have been rather dreary. No doubt it
was Conrad’s habit to sit and stare at the coals, and to poke the fire
savagely when things went amiss with him; when his favourite barque was
scuttled by a mutinous crew, or his cargo confiscated by the minions of
the law.

Launcelot Darrell was engaged to dine at the Priory upon this 16th of
February. Mr. Monckton had invited him, in order that some matters
connected with Laura’s fortune might be discussed.

“It is fully time we should understand each other, Darrell,” the lawyer
said; “so I shall expect you to give me a couple of hours in my study
this evening after dinner, if you’ve no objection.”

Of course Mr. Darrell had no objection, but he had an almost spiteful
manner that day in his intercourse with poor Laura, who was bewildered
by the change in him.

“You think it’s strange that I should dislike all this ceremony about
settlements and allowance. Yes, Laura, _that’s_ a pleasant word,
isn’t it? Your guardian honoured me by telling me he should make us a
handsome allowance for the first few years of our married life. You
think I ought to take kindly to this sort of thing, I dare say, and
drop quietly into my position of genteel pauperism, dependent upon my
pencil, or my wife, for the dinner I eat, and the coat I wear. No,
Laura,” cried the young man, passionately, “I don’t take kindly to it;
I can’t stand it. The thought of my position enrages me against myself,
against you, against everybody and everything in the world.”

Launcelot Darrell talked thus to his betrothed while Richard and
Eleanor were both in the room; the scene-painter sitting in a window
making furtive sketches with a fat little stump of lead pencil upon
the backs of divers letters; Mrs. Monckton standing at another window
looking out at the leafless trees, the black flowerless garden beds,
the rain-drops hanging on the dingy firs and evergreens.

Mr. Darrell knew that he was overheard; but he had no wish that it
should be otherwise. He did not care to keep his grievances a secret.
The egotism of his nature exhibited itself in this. He gave himself
the airs of a victim, and made a show of despising the benefits he was
about to accept from his confiding betrothed. He in a manner proclaimed
himself injured by the existence of his future wife’s fortune; and he
forced her to apologize to him for the prosperity which she was about
to bestow upon him.

“As if it was being a pauper to take my money,” cried Miss Mason, with
great tenderness, albeit in rather obscure English; “as if I grudged
you the horrid money, Launcelot. Why, I don’t even know how much I’m
to have. It may be fifty pounds a-year—that’s what I’ve had to buy my
dresses and things since I was fifteen—or it may be fifty thousand. I
don’t want to know how much it is. If it _is_ fifty thousand a-year,
you’re welcome to it, Launcelot, darling.”

“Launcelot darling” shrugged his shoulders with a peevish gesture,
which exhibited him rather as a discontented darling.

“You talk like a baby, Laura,” he said, contemptuously; “I suppose the
‘handsome allowance’ Mr. Monckton promises will be about two or three
hundred a year, or so; something that I’m to eke out by my industry.
Heaven knows he has preached to me enough about the necessity of being
industrious. One would think that an artist was a bricklayer or a
stonemason, to hear him talk.”

Eleanor turned away from the window as Launcelot Darrell said this; she
could not suffer her husband to be undefended while she was by.

“I have no doubt whatever Mr. Monckton said was right, Mr. Darrell,”
she exclaimed, lifting her head proudly, as if in defiance of any voice
that should gainsay her husband’s merits.

“No doubt, Mrs. Monckton; but there’s a certain sledgehammer-like way
of propounding that which is right that isn’t always pleasant. I don’t
want to be reminded that an artist’s calling is a trade, and that when
the Graces bless me with a happy thought I must work like a slave until
I’ve hammered it out upon canvas and sent it into the market for sale.”

“Some people think the Graces are propitiated by hard labour,” Richard
Thornton said, quietly, without raising his eyes from his rapid pencil,
“and that the happiest thoughts are apt to come when a man has his
brush in his hand, rather than when he is lying on a sofa reading
French novels; though I have known artists who preferred that method of
waiting for inspiration. For my own part, I believe in the inspiration
that grows out of patient labour.”

“Yes,” Mr. Darrell answered, with an air of lazy indifference,—an
air which plainly expressed that he disdained to discuss art-topics
with a scene-painter, “I dare say you find it answer—in your line.
You must splash over a good deal of canvas before you can produce a
transformation-scene, I suppose?”

“Peter Paul Rubens got over a good deal of canvas,” said Richard, “and
Raffaello Sanzio d’Urbino did something in that way, if we may judge by
the cartoons and a few other trifles.”

“Oh, of course, there were giants in those days. I don’t aspire to
rival any such Patagonians. I don’t see why people should be compelled
to walk through a picture-gallery a mile long before they can pronounce
an opinion upon a painter’s merits. I should be very well contented if
my chance with posterity rested upon half-a-dozen pictures no bigger
than Millais’s ‘Huguenots;’ and as good.”

“And I’m sure you could do dozens and dozens as good as that,” cried
Laura. “Why, it’s only a lady tying a scarf round her lover’s arm, and
a lot of green leaves. Of course it’s very pretty, you know, and one
feels very much for her, poor thing, and one’s afraid that he’ll let
those cruel Catholics kill him, and that she’ll die broken-hearted. But
you could paint lots of pictures like that, Launcelot, if you chose.”

The young man did not condescend to notice his affianced wife’s
art-criticism. He relapsed into gloomy silence, and once more betook
himself to that savage kind of consolation afforded by a sturdy
exercise of the poker.

“But, Launcelot,” pleaded Miss Mason, presently, “I’m sure you needn’t
be unhappy about my having money, and your being poor. There’s Mr. de
Crespigny’s fortune, you know; he can’t be shameful and wicked enough
to leave it to any one but you. My guardian said, only the other day,
that he thought it would be left to you.”

“Oh, ah, to be sure,” muttered Mr. Darrell, moodily; “there’s _that_
chance, of course.”

“He couldn’t leave Woodlands to those two old maids, you know,
Launcelot, could he?”

To the surprise of the two listeners, Richard Thornton and Eleanor, the
young man burst into a harsh disdainful laugh.

“My respected maiden aunts!” he exclaimed; “poor devils, they’ve had a
nice time of it.”

Until this moment Richard and Eleanor had most firmly believed that
the will which disinherited Launcelot Darrell bequeathed the Woodlands
fortune to the two maiden sisters, Lavinia and Sarah de Crespigny;
but the young man’s disdainful laugh, and the contemptuous, yet
half-pitying tone in which he spoke of the two sisters, plainly
revealed that if he knew the secret of the disposal of Maurice de
Crespigny’s fortune, and knew that it was not left to himself, he knew
also that equal disappointment and mortification awaited his aunts.

He had been in the habit of speaking of them with a savage though
suppressed animosity. To-day his tone was utterly changed. He had a
malicious pleasure, no doubt, in thinking of the disappointment in
store for them; and he could afford now to feel a kind of disdainful
compassion for all their wasted labours, their useless patience.

But to whom, then, could the fortune be left?

Eleanor and Richard looked at each other in amazement. It might have
been supposed that the old man had left his wealth to Eleanor herself,
influenced by the caprice that had induced him to attach himself to
her, because of her likeness to his dead friend. But this could not
be, for the invalid had distinctly declared that he should leave
nothing but George Vane’s miniature to his new favourite; and Maurice
de Crespigny was not a man to say one thing and mean another. He had
spoken of a duty to be fulfilled, a duty which he was determined to
perform.

Yet, to whom could he possibly owe any duty, except to his kindred? Had
he any other relations except his three nieces and Launcelot Darrell?
He might have other claims upon him. He might have some poor and
modest kindred who had kept aloof from him, and refrained from paying
court to him, and whose forbearance he might choose to reward in an
unlooked-for, unthought-of manner.

And again, he might have bequeathed his money to some charitable
institution, or in trust for some new scheme of philanthropy. Such
a course would scarcely be strange in a lonely old man, who in his
nearest relations might only recognize eager, expectant harpies keeping
anxious watch for the welcome hour of his death.

Eleanor Monckton did not trouble herself much about this question. She
believed, from Launcelot Darrell’s manner, that Richard Thornton had
drawn the right inference from the meeting of the young man and the
lawyer’s clerk.

She believed implicitly that Launcelot Darrell’s name was omitted from
his great-uncle’s last will, and that he knew it.

This belief inspired her with a new feeling. She could afford to be
patient now. If Maurice de Crespigny should die suddenly, he would not
die leaving his wealth to enrich the traitor who had cheated a helpless
old man. Her only thought now must be to prevent Laura’s marriage; and
for this she must look to her husband, Gilbert Monckton.

“He will never let the girl whose destiny has been confided to him
marry a bad man,” she thought; “I have only to tell him the story of my
father’s death, and to prove to him Launcelot Darrell’s guilt.”

The dinner went off very quietly. Mr. Monckton was reserved and silent,
as it had lately become his habit to be. Launcelot Darrell had still
the gloomy, discontented air that had made him a very unpleasant
companion throughout that day. The young man was not a hypocrite, and
had no power of concealing his feelings. He could tell any number of
lies that might be necessary for his own convenience or safety; but
he was not a hypocrite. Hypocrisy involves a great deal of trouble on
the part of those who practise it: and is, moreover, the vice of a man
who sets no little value upon the opinion of his fellow-creatures. Mr.
Darrell was of a listless and lazy temperament, and nourished in utter
abhorrence of all work, either physical or mental. On the other hand,
he had so good an opinion of himself as to be tolerably indifferent to
the opinions of others.

If he had been accused of a crime he would have denied having committed
it, for his own sake. But he never troubled himself to consider what
other people might think of him, so long as their opinion had no power
to affect his personal comfort or safety.

The cloth had been removed; for old fashions held their ground at
Tolldale Priory, where a dinner _à la Russe_ would have been looked
upon as an absurd institution, more like a child’s feast of fruit
and flowers, cakes and sugar-plums, than a substantial meal intended
for sensible people. The cloth had been removed, and that dreary
ceremonial, a good old English dessert, was in progress, when a servant
brought Launcelot Darrell a card upon a salver, and presented it to him
solemnly, amid the silence of the company.

The young man was sitting next Eleanor Monckton, and she saw that the
card was of a highly glazed and slippery nature and of an abnormal
size, between the ordinary sizes of a gentleman’s and a lady’s card.

The blood rushed to Launcelot Darrell’s forehead as he read the name
upon the card, and Eleanor saw his under lip contract with a sudden
movement, expressive of intense vexation.

“How did this—this gentleman come here?” he asked, turning to the
servant.

“The gentleman has driven over from Hazlewood, sir. Hearing you were
dining here, he came on to see you, he says; is he to be shown into the
drawing-room?”

“Yes—no: I’ll come out and see him. Will you excuse me, Mr.
Monckton: this is an old acquaintance of mine? Rather a pertinacious
acquaintance, as you may perceive by his manner of following me up
to-night.”

Mr. Darrell rose, pushed aside his chair, and went out of the
dining-room, followed by the servant.

The hall was brilliantly lighted, and in the few moments during
which the servant slowly followed Launcelot Darrell, Eleanor had an
opportunity of seeing the stranger who had come to the Priory.

He was standing under the light of the large gas-lamp, shaking
the rain-drops from his hat, and with his face turned towards the
dining-room door.

He was short and stout, smartly dressed, and foppish-looking even
in his travelling costume; and he was no other than the talkative
Frenchman who had persuaded George Vane to leave his daughter alone
upon the Boulevard on the night of August 11th, 1853.




CHAPTER XXXVII.

LAUNCELOT’S TROUBLES.


Eleanor Monckton sat looking at the door which had closed upon the
scene in the lamplit hall, almost as if the intensity of her gaze could
have pierced the solid oaken panel and revealed to her that which was
taking place outside the dining-room.

Richard Thornton and her husband, both watching her face, marvelled
at the sudden change in its expression,—the look of rapt wonder and
amazement that had come over it from the moment in which Launcelot
Darrell had gone out into the hall. Richard guessed that something
strange and unexpected had occurred, but Gilbert Monckton, who was
quite in the dark as to his wife’s feelings, could only stare blankly
at her face, and mutely wonder at the mystery which tortured him. Laura
Mason, who had been throughout the day alarmed by her lover’s manner,
was too anxious about Launcelot Darrell to observe the face of her
friend.

“I’m sure there’s something wrong,” she said; “I’m sure there is,
Mr. Monckton. You don’t know how Launcelot’s been going on all day,
frightening me out of my wits. Hasn’t he, now, Eleanor? Hasn’t he, Mr.
Thornton? Saying he won’t be a pauper, dependent upon his wife, and
that you’ve wounded his feelings by talking about art as if you were
a bricklayer; or as if he was a bricklayer, I forget which. I had a
presentiment all day that something was going to happen; and Launcelot
did go on so, staring at the fire, and hammering the coals, and sighing
as if he had something awful on his mind—as if he’d committed a crime,
you know, and was brooding over it,” added the young lady, with an
evident relish of the last idea.

Mr. Monckton looked contemptuously at his ward. The girl’s frivolous
babble was in horrible discord with his own anxiety—a kind of parody of
his own alarm.

“What do you mean by committing crimes, Laura?” he said. “I’m afraid
you’ll never learn to talk like a reasonable being. Is there anything
so very miraculous in the fact that some old acquaintance of Mr.
Darrell’s has come down to Berkshire to see him?”

Laura Mason breathed a sigh of relief.

“You don’t think, then, that Launcelot has done something dreadful, and
that this man has come to arrest him?” she asked. “It seems so odd his
coming here on a dark winter’s night; and Launcelot looked angry when
he saw the card the servant gave him. I’m sure it’s something dreadful.
Let’s go into the drawing-room, Eleanor. We shall have to pass through
the hall, and if there’s anything wrong we can find out all about it.”

Eleanor started as Laura addressed her, and rose suddenly, aroused by
the necessity of having to attend to something that had been said to
her, but scarcely knowing what that something was.

“Eleanor!” exclaimed her husband, “how pale you are, and how strangely
you look at that door. One would think that you were influenced by
Laura’s absurd fears.”

“Oh, no! I am not frightened of anything; only I——”

She paused, hesitating, and looking down in painful embarrassment.

“Only what?”

“I happened to see the person who has come to speak to Mr. Darrell,
and—and—his face reminded me of a man I saw a long time ago.”

Richard looked up quickly.

“But was there anything so very startling in the mere coincidence of a
likeness?”

“Oh, no, nothing startling.”

“Upon my word, Eleanor,” exclaimed Gilbert Monckton, impatiently, “we
seem to live in an atmosphere of mystery, which, to say the least
of it, is far from agreeable to those who only occupy the position
of lookers-on. There, there, go to the drawing-room with Laura. Mr.
Thornton and I will follow you almost immediately. We shall have very
little pleasure in sitting over our wine with a consciousness that a
kind of Gunpowder Plot is going on in the hall outside.”

The lawyer filled his glass with claret, and pushed the crystal
jug towards Richard; but he left the wine untasted before him, and
he sat silently brooding over his suspicions, with a bent brow and
rigidly-compressed lips.

It was no use to struggle against his destiny, he thought. Life was to
be always a dreary French novel, in which he was to play the victim
husband. He had loved and trusted this girl. He had seen innocence
and candour beaming in her face, and he had dared to believe in her;
and from the very hour of her marriage a horrible transformation had
taken place in this frank and fearless creature. A hundred changes
of expression, all equally mysterious to him, had converted the face
he loved into a wearisome and incomprehensible enigma, which it was
the torment of his life to endeavour vainly and hopelessly to guess.
Richard Thornton opened the door, and Eleanor gladly made her escape
from the dining-room, holding Laura’s hand in hers, and with the
Signora following close behind her. The three women entered the hall in
a group, and paused for a moment looking at Launcelot Darrell and the
stranger.

Mr. Darrell stood near the open hall-door with his hands in his
pockets, and his head bent in that sulky attitude which Eleanor had
good reason to remember. The stranger, smoothing the wet nap of his hat
with a careful hand, seemed to be talking in a tone of remonstrance,
and, as it were, urging something upon his companion. This was only
to be guessed by the expression of his face, as the voice in which he
spoke was scarcely above a whisper.

The three ladies crossed the hall and went into the drawing-room.
Eleanor had no need to confirm her sudden recognition of the Frenchman
by any second scrutiny of his face. She sat down near the broad hearth,
and began to think how this man’s unlooked-for coming might affect the
fulfilment of her purpose. Would he be likely to thwart her? or could
he not, perhaps, be induced to help her?

“I must talk to Richard,” she thought. “He knows the world better than
I do. I am almost as much a child as Laura.”

While Mrs. Monckton sat looking absently at the fire, and trying to
imagine how the advent of the Frenchman might be made subservient to
the scheme of her life, Miss Mason burst into a torrent of panegyric
upon the stranger’s appearance.

“He’s such a good-natured-looking dear,” she exclaimed, “with curly
hair and a moustache just like the Emperor’s; and the idea of my
frightening myself so about him, and thinking he was a dreadful
creature in a slouched hat, and with his coat-collar turned up to hide
his face, come to arrest Launcelot for some awful crime. I’m not a bit
frightened now, and I hope Launcelot will bring him in to tea. The idea
of his being a foreigner, too! I think foreigners are _so_ interesting.
Don’t you, Nelly?”

Eleanor Monckton looked up at the sound of her name. She had not heard
a word that Laura had said.

“What, dear?” she asked, listlessly.

“Don’t you think foreigners interesting, Nelly?” repeated the young
lady.

“Interesting? No.”

“What! not Frenchmen?”

Mrs. Monckton gave a faint shiver.

“Frenchmen!” she said. “No, I don’t like them, I——. How do I know,
Laura? Baseness and treachery belong to no peculiar people, I suppose?”

Mr. Monckton and the scene-painter came into the drawing-room at this
moment, followed pretty closely by Launcelot Darrell.

“What have you done with your friend, Darrell?” Gilbert Monckton asked,
with a look of surprise.

“Oh, he’s gone,” the young man answered, indifferently.

“You’ve let him go without asking him to rest, or take some
refreshment?”

“Yes, I contrived to get rid of him.”

“We don’t usually ‘contrive to get rid’ of people when they come here
on a wet winter night,” said Mr. Monckton. “You’ll give Tolldale Priory
a reputation for inhospitality, I fear. Why did you not ask your friend
to stop?”

“Because I didn’t care to introduce him to you,” Launcelot Darrell
answered, coolly. “I never said he was a friend of mine. He’s only
an acquaintance, and a very intrusive acquaintance. He had no right
to ferret out my whereabouts, and to come down here after me. A man
doesn’t want past associations forced upon him, however agreeable they
may have been.”

“And still less when those associations are disagreeable. I understand.
But who is this man?”

“He’s a Frenchman, a _commis voyageur_, or something of that kind; by
no means a distinguished acquaintance. He’s a good fellow, in his own
particular fashion, and would go out of his way to do me a service, I
dare say; but he’s rather too fond of absinthe, or brandy, or any other
spirit he can get hold of.”

“You mean that he is a drunkard,” said Mr. Monckton.

“I don’t say that. But I know that the poor devil has had more than one
attack of delirium tremens in the course of his life. He’s over here in
the interests of a patent mustard, I believe, lately invented by some
great Parisian gastronomer.”

“Indeed; and where did you make his acquaintance?”

The same crimson hue that had mounted to Mr. Darrell’s forehead when
the Frenchman’s card was handed to him dyed his face now, and he
hesitated for a few moments before replying to Gilbert Monckton’s
straight question. But he recovered himself pretty quickly, and
answered with his accustomed carelessness of manner:

“Where did I know him? Oh, in London, of course. He was an inhabitant
of that refuge for the destitute of all nations, some years ago, while
I was sowing my wild oats there.”

“Before you went to India?”

“Yes, of course, before I went to India.”

Mr. Monckton looked sharply at the young man’s face. There were moments
when the lawyer’s prudence, when the conscientious scruples of an
honest man got the better of the husband’s selfish fears; and in those
moments Gilbert Monckton doubted whether he was doing his duty towards
his ward in suffering her to marry Launcelot Darrell.

Was the young man worthy of the trust that was to be confided to him?
Was he a fitting husband for an inexperienced and frivolous girl?

Mr. Monckton could only answer this question in one way. He could only
satisfy his conscience by taking a cynical view of the matter.

“Launcelot Darrell is as good as other young men, I dare say,” he
argued. “He’s good-looking, and conceited, and shallow, and idle; but
the poor little girl has chosen to fall in love with him, and if I
come between them, and forbid this marriage, and make the silly child
unhappy by forcing my choice upon her I may be quite as much mistaken
as she, and after all marry her to a bad man. I may just as well let
her draw her own number in the great lottery, and trust to Providence
for its being a lucky one.”

But to-night there was something in Launcelot Darrell’s manner which
aroused a vague suspicion in the breast of the lawyer.

“Then your friend the _commis voyageur_ has gone back to Windsor, I
suppose?” he said.

“No; I couldn’t very well avoid giving him shelter, as he chose to
come, though he came uninvited. I sent him back to Hazlewood with a
few lines addressed to my mother, who will do her best to make him
comfortable, I dare say. Poor soul, she would scarcely refuse to
shelter a stray dog, if the wandering cur were in any way attached to
me.”

“Yes, Mr. Darrell, you have reason to value your mother’s affection,”
answered the lawyer, gravely. “But we must not forget that we’ve a good
deal of business to transact to-night. Will you come with me into my
study, as soon as you’ve finished that cup of tea?”

Launcelot Darrell bowed, and set down his teacup on the nearest table.
Eleanor and Richard had both watched him closely since his coming into
the drawing-room. It was easy to see that he had by no means recovered
from the unpleasant surprise caused him by the Frenchman’s visit. His
careless manner was only assumed, and it was with evident difficulty
that he responded to each new demand made upon his attention.

He followed Gilbert Monckton slowly and silently from the room,
without having lingered to speak so much as a word to Laura, without
having even made her happy by so much as a look.

“He might have spoken to me,” the young lady murmured, disconsolately,
as she watched her lover’s retreating figure.

Two hours elapsed before the gentlemen returned to the drawing-room;
two dreary hours for Laura, who sat yawning over a book, or playing
with her two dogs, which, by virtue of their high breeding and good
conduct, were constant occupants of the drawing-room at Tolldale.
Richard Thornton and Mrs. Monckton played a game of chess, the
strangest game, perhaps, that ever was played, for the moving backwards
and forwards of the ivory pieces was a mere pretence, by means of which
Eleanor contrived to take counsel with her faithful ally.

“Do you think this man’s coming will help us, Dick?” she asked, when
she had told the story of her recognition of the Frenchman.

Richard shook his head, not negatively, but reflectively.

“How can I tell?” he said; “the man may or may not be inclined to
betray his friend. In any case it will be very difficult for us to get
at him.”

“Not for _you_, Richard,” murmured Eleanor, persuasively.

“Not for _me_,” echoed the young man. “Syren, mermaiden, witch of
the sea, avaunt! It was you and the blue bonnet that settled for the
shipbroker and his clerks. Have you the blue bonnet still, Nell; or
have you any other influence in the millinery line that you can bring
to bear upon this traveller in mustard?”

“But if he should remember me?”

“That’s scarcely likely. His face was impressed upon your mind by
the awful circumstance that followed your meeting with him. You have
changed very much since you were fifteen years of age, Mrs. Monckton.
You were a feminine hobbledehoy then. Now you are—never mind what. A
superb Nemesis in crinoline, bent on deeds of darkness and horror. No,
I do not see any reason to fear this man’s recognition of you.”

The expression of Launcelot Darrell’s face had subsided into a settled
gloom when he reappeared in the drawing-room with Mr. Monckton.

The lawyer seated himself at a reading-table, and began to open the
evening papers, which were sent from Windsor to Tolldale. Launcelot
strolled over to Laura Mason, and, sitting down beside her, amused
himself by pulling the silky ears of the Skye terrier.

“Do tell me everything, Launcelot,” said Miss Mason. “You don’t know
how much I’ve suffered all this evening. I hope the interview was a
pleasant one?”

“Oh, yes, remarkably pleasant,” answered the young man, with a sneer.
“I shall not be exposed to the reproach of having made a mercenary
marriage, Laura, at any rate.”

“What do you mean, Launcelot?” cried the young lady, staring aghast at
her lover. “You don’t mean that my guardian’s been deceiving me all
this time, and that I’m a poor penniless creature after all, and that
I ought to have been a companion, or a nursery governess, or something
of that kind, as Eleanor was before her marriage. You don’t mean that,
Launcelot!”

“Not precisely,” answered Mr. Darrell; “but I mean that the noble
allowance of which your guardian has talked so much is to be two
hundred a year: which, as we are so unfortunate as to possess the
habits of a gentleman and a lady, will not go very far.”

“But ain’t I rich,—ain’t I an heiress?” cried Miss Mason. “Haven’t I
what-you-may-call-’ems—expectations?”

“Oh, yes. I believe there is some vague promise of future wealth
held out as a compensation for all present deprivations. But really,
although your guardian took great pains to explain the dry business
details to me, I was almost too tired to listen to him; and certainly
too stupid to understand very clearly what he meant. I believe there is
some money which you are to have by-and-by, upon the death of somebody.
But as it seems that the somebody is a person in the prime of life, who
has the power of altering his will at any moment that he may take it
into his head to do so, I look upon that expectation as rather a remote
contingency. No, Laura, we must look our position straight in the face.
A life of hard work lies before me; a life of poverty before you.”

Miss Mason made a wry face. Her mind had little power to realize
anything but extremes. Her idea of poverty was something very horrible.
An existence of beggary, with the chance of being called upon to do
plain needlework for her daily bread, and with a workhouse at the end
of the prospect.

“But I shall love you all the same, Launcelot,” she whispered,
“however poor we may be, and I’ll wear dresses without any trimming,
and imitation lace. I suppose _you_ wouldn’t know imitation lace from
real Valenciennes, Launcelot, and it’s so cheap. And I’ll try and make
pies and puddings, and I’ll learn to be economical, and I’ve lots of
jewellery that my guardian has given me, and we can sell that, if you
like. I’ll work as hard as that poor woman in the poem, Launcelot,
for your sake. ‘Stitch, stitch, stitch, band and gusset and seam.’ I
don’t mind the seams, dear; _they’d_ be easy if one didn’t prick one’s
fingers and make knots in one’s thread; but I’m afraid I shall never be
able to manage the gussets. Only promise me that you’ll love me still,
Launcelot. Tell me that you don’t hate me because I’m poor.”

The young man took the soft little hand that was laid with an imploring
gesture on his wrist, and pressed it tenderly.

“I should be a brute if I wasn’t grateful for your love, Laura,” he
said. “I didn’t wish _you_ to be rich. I’m not the sort of fellow who
could contentedly accept a degraded position, and sponge upon a wife’s
fortune. I only wanted—I only wanted what I had been taught to expect,”
he muttered, with a savage accent; “I’m set upon and hemmed in on every
side, and I’ve a hundred mortifications and miseries to bear for want
of money. But I’ll try and make you a good husband, my dear.”

“You will, Launcelot,” cried the girl, melted by some touch of real
earnestness in her lover’s tone that was new and welcome to her.
“How good it is of you to say that. But how should you be otherwise
than good; and you will be a great painter, and all the world will
admire you and talk about you, and we shall be so happy,—shan’t we,
Launcelot?—wandering through Italy together.”

The young man answered her with a bitter laugh.

“Yes, Laura,” he said, “the sooner we get to Italy the better. Heaven
knows, I’ve no particular interest that need keep me in England, now.”




CHAPTER XXXVIII.

MR. MONCKTON BRINGS GLOOMY TIDINGS FROM WOODLANDS.


For some few days after the Frenchman’s arrival, Launcelot Darrell
stopped away from the Priory, much to the regret of his betrothed,
whose delight in her _trousseau_ was not sufficient to fill the blank
made by her lover’s absence. Miss Mason roamed disconsolately about the
house, looking out at the bare trees, and the desolate garden walks,
and quoted Tennyson until she became obnoxious to her fellow-creatures
by reason of her regret that _he_ did not come, and her anxiety that
the day should be done, and other lamentations to the same effect.

She ran out of doors sometimes under the bleak February sky, with a
cambric handkerchief over her head as a sensible protection from the
bitter atmosphere, and her light ringlets flying in the wind, to stand
at a little doorway in the high garden wall, and watch for her lover’s
coming by a narrow pathway through the wood, by which it was his wont
to make a short cut for himself in dry weather.

She was standing in this narrow doorway upon the afternoon of the
22nd of February—only twenty-one days before that eventful morning
which was to make her Launcelot Darrell’s wife—with Eleanor Monckton
by her side. The short winter’s day was closing in, and the shadows
were thickening in the low woodland, whatever light might linger on
the hill-tops above Tolldale. The two women were silent: Eleanor was
in very low spirits, for on this day she had lost her friend and
counsellor, Richard Thornton, who had had no alternative but to leave
Tolldale, or to forfeit a very remunerative and advantageous engagement
at one of the Edinburgh Theatres, whither he had been summoned to paint
the scenery for a grand Easter burlesque, about to be produced with
unusual splendour, by a speculative Scottish manager; and who had,
therefore, departed, taking his aunt with him. George Vane’s daughter
felt terribly helpless in the absence of this faithful ally. Richard
had promised to attend to her summons, and to return to Tolldale at any
hour, if she should have need of his services; but he was separated
from her by a long distance, and how could she tell when the moment of
that need might come? She was alone, amongst people who had no sympathy
with the purpose of her life, and she bitterly felt the desolation
of her position.

It was no very great wonder, then, if she was thoughtful and silent,
and by no means the joyous, light-hearted companion whom Laura Mason
had loved and clung to at Hazlewood, before the coming of Launcelot
Darrell. This young lady watched her now, furtively, almost fearfully,
wondering at the change in her, and speculating as to the cause of it.

“She _must_ have been in love with Launcelot,” Laura thought; “how
could she help being in love with him? And she married my guardian
because he’s rich, and now she’s sorry for having done so. And she’s
unhappy because I’m going to be married to Launcelot. And, oh! suppose
Launcelot should still be in love with her; like the hero of a dreadful
French novel!”

The dusk was deepening in the wood, when two figures emerged from the
narrow pathway. A tall, slenderly-built young man, who switched the low
brushwood and the fern with his light cane as he walked along, and a
puffy little individual with a curly-brimmed hat, who trotted briskly
by his side.

Laura was not slow to recognize her lover even in that doubtful
light, and Eleanor knew that the young man’s companion was the French
commercial traveller.

Mr. Darrell introduced his friend to the two ladies.

“Monsieur Victor Bourdon, Mrs. Monckton, Miss Mason,” he muttered,
hastily. “I dare say you have thought me very neglectful, Laura,”
he added; “but I have been driving Monsieur Bourdon about the
neighbourhood for the last day or two. He’s a stranger in this part of
the country, though he’s almost as much an Englishman as I am.”

Monsieur Bourdon laughed as he acknowledged the compliment, with an air
that was evidently intended to be fascinating.

“Y-a-a-se,” he said, “we have been to Vindsor. It is very naice.”

Launcelot Darrell frowned, and looked angrily at his companion.

“Yes, Bourdon wanted to have a look at the state apartments,” he
said; “he wanted to compare them with those interminable galleries at
Versailles, I suppose, to the disparagement of our national glory.”

“But the apartments are closed,” said Eleanor.

“Oh! of course,” answered Mr. Darrell, looking at her rather
suspiciously, “they always are closed when you happen to want to
see them. Just like everything else in this world of anomalies and
paradoxes.”

“He has taken his friend to Windsor,” Eleanor thought; “had this visit
any relation to his last visit? Did he go there to see Mr. Lawford’s
clerk?”

She was helpless without Richard, and could not answer this question.

“I’ll write to him to-night,” she thought, “and ask him to come back to
me directly.”

But in the next moment she was ashamed of herself for her selfishness.
She might sacrifice her own life to her scheme of vengeance. The voice
of her father crying to her from his unsanctified grave, seemed for
ever urging her to do that; but she had no right to call upon others to
make the same sacrifice.

“No,” she thought, “wherever the road I have chosen may lead me,
however difficult the path may be to follow, I will henceforward tread
it alone. Poor Dick! I have tormented him long enough with my sorrows
and my helplessness.”

“You’ve come to dine, of course, Launcelot,” Miss Mason said, while
Eleanor stood motionless and silent in the doorway, absorbed in these
thoughts, and looking like some pale statue in the dusk; “and you’ve
brought your friend, Monsieur—Monsieur Bourdon, to dine——”

“Ah, but no, mademoiselle,” exclaimed the Frenchman, in a transport of
humility. “I am not one of yours. Monsieur Darrell is so good as to
call me his friend, but——”

The Frenchman murmured something of a deprecatory nature, to the effect
that he was only a humble commercial traveller in the interests of a
patent article that was very much appreciated by all the crowned heads
of Europe, and which would doubtless, by the aid of his exertions
and those of his compatriots, become, before long, a cosmopolitan
necessity, and the source of a colossal fortune.

Eleanor shuddered and shrank away from the man with a gesture almost
expressive of disgust, as he turned to her in his voluble depreciation
of himself and glorification of the merchandise which it was his duty
to praise.

She remembered that it was this man, this loquacious vulgarian, who had
been Launcelot Darrell’s tool on the night of her father’s death. This
was the wretch who had stood behind George Vane’s chair, and watched
the old man’s play, and telegraphed to his accomplice.

If she could have forgotten Launcelot Darrell’s treachery, this
presence would have been enough to remind her of that pitiless
baseness, to inspire her with a tenfold disgust for that hideous
cruelty. It seemed as if the Frenchman’s coming had been designed by
Providence to urge her to new energy, new determination.

“The man who could make this creature his accomplice in a plot against
my father shall never inherit Maurice de Crespigny’s fortune,” she
thought; “he shall never marry my husband’s ward.”

She linked her arm in Laura’s as she thought this; as if by that simple
and involuntary action she would have shielded her from Launcelot
Darrell.

In the next moment a footstep—the firm tread of a man—sounded on the
crisp gravel of the garden walk behind the two girls, and presently
Gilbert Monckton laid his hand lightly upon his wife’s shoulder.

She was startled by his unexpected coming, and turning suddenly round,
looked at him with a scared face; which was a new evidence against her
in his troubled mind, a new testimony that she was keeping some secret
from him.

He had left Tolldale Priory early that morning to give a day’s
attention to that business of which he had been lately so neglectful,
and had returned a couple of hours before his usual time for coming
home.

“What brings you out into the garden this bitter afternoon, Eleanor?”
he said, sternly; “you’ll catch cold in that thin shawl; and you, too,
Laura; I should have thought a seat by the drawing-room fire far more
comfortable than this dreary garden. Good evening, gentlemen; you had
better bring your friend into the house, Mr. Darrell.”

The young man muttered something of an apologetic nature, and Monsieur
Victor Bourdon acknowledged the lawyer’s cold salutation with an
infinite number of bows and smirks.

“You have come home by an earlier train than usual, Gilbert,” Mrs.
Monckton said, by way of saying something that might break the silence
which had followed her husband’s coming; “we did not expect you until
seven.”

“I came to Windsor by the three o’clock express,” answered Mr.
Monckton. “I have not come straight home. I stopped at Woodlands to
inquire after the invalid.”

Eleanor looked up with a new and eager expression in her face.

“And Mr. de Crespigny—he is better, I hope.”

“No, Eleanor, I fear that you will never see him again. The doctors
scarcely hope that he will last out the week.”

The girl set her lips firmly, and raised her head with a resolute
gesture—a mute expression of determination and defiance.

“I _will_ see him again,” she thought; “I will not trust my hope of
vengeance to a chance. He may have altered his will, perhaps. Come what
may, I will stand beside his sick bed. I will tell him who I am, and
call upon him, in my dead father’s name, to do an act of justice.”

Launcelot Darrell stood with his head bent and his eyes fixed upon the
ground.

As it was the habit of Eleanor to lift her forehead with something of
the air of a young war-horse who scents the breath of the battle-field
afar, so it was this young man’s manner to look moodily earthward under
the influence of any violent agitation.

“So,” he said, slowly, “the old man is dying?”

“Yes,” answered Mr. Monckton; “your great-uncle is dying. You may be
master of Woodlands, Launcelot, before many days are past.”

The young man drew a long breath.

“Yes,” he muttered; “I may: I _may_.”




CHAPTER XXXIX.

LAUNCELOT’S COUNSELLOR.


Mr. Darrell, and his friend the commercial traveller, did not linger
long at the garden gate. There was nothing very cordial or conciliatory
in Gilbert Monckton’s manner, and he had evidently no wish to cultivate
any intimate relations with Monsieur Victor Bourdon.

Nor was Launcelot Darrell by any means anxious that his companion
should be invited to stop at Tolldale. He had brought the Frenchman to
the Priory, but he had only done so because Monsieur Bourdon was one of
those pertinacious gentlemen not easily to be shaken off by the victims
who are so unfortunate as to have fallen into their power.

“Well,” said the artist, as the two men walked away from the Priory in
the murky dusk, “what do you think of her?”

“Of which _her_? _La belle future_, or the otha-i-r?”

“What do you think of Mrs. Monckton? I don’t want your opinion of my
future wife, thank you.”

Monsieur Bourdon looked at his companion with a smile that was half a
sneer.

“He is so proud, this dear Monsieur Lan— Darrell,” he said. “You ask
of me what I think of Mrs. Monck-a-tonne,” he continued, in English;
“shall I tell you what I think without reserve?”

“Yes, of course.”

“I think, then, that she is a woman of a thousand—in all that there is
of resolute—in all that there is of impulsive—in all that there is of
daring—a woman unapproachable, unsurpassable; beautiful to damn the
angels! If in the little business that we came to talk about lately
this woman is to be in the way, I say to you, my friend, beware! If
there is to be any contest between you and her, beware!”

“Pray don’t go into heroics, Bourdon,” answered Launcelot Darrell, with
evident displeasure. Vanity was one of the artist’s strongest vices;
and he writhed at the notion of being considered inferior to any one,
above all to a woman. “I knew Mrs. Monckton, and I knew that she was a
clever, high-spirited girl before to-day. I don’t want you to tell me
that. As to any contest between her and me, there’s no chance of that
arising. _She_ doesn’t stand in my way.”

“And you refuse to tell to your devoted friend the name of the person
who does stand in your way?” murmured Monsieur Bourdon, in his most
insinuating tones.

“Because that information cannot be of the least consequence to my
devoted friend,” answered Launcelot Darrell, coolly. “If my devoted
friend has helped me, he will expect to be paid for his help, I dare
say.”

“But, certainly!” cried the Frenchman, with an air of candour; “you
will recompense me for my services if we are successful; and above all
for the suggestion which first put into your head the idea——”

“The suggestion which prompted me to the commission of a——”

“Hush, my friend, even the trees in this wood may have ears.”

“Yes, Bourdon,” continued Launcelot, bitterly, “I have good reason to
thank you, and to reward you. From the hour in which we first met until
now, you have contrived to do me some noble services.”

Monsieur Bourdon laughed a dry, mocking laugh, which had something of
the diabolically grotesque in its sound.

“Ah, what a noble creation of the poet’s mind is Faust!” he exclaimed;
“that excellent, that amiable hero; who would never, of his own will,
do any harm; but who is always led into the commission of all manner
of wickedness by Mephistopheles. And then, when this noble but unhappy
man is steeped to the very lips in sin, he can turn upon that wicked
counsellor and say,’Demon, it is for your pleasure these crimes have
been committed!’ Of course he forgets, this impulsive Faust, that it
was he, and not Mephistopheles, who was in love with poor Gretchen!”

“Don’t be a fool, Bourdon,” muttered the artist, impatiently. “You
know what I mean. When I started in life I was too proud to commit a
dishonourable action. It is you, and such as you, who have made me what
I am.”

“Bah!” exclaimed the Frenchman, snapping his fingers with a gesture of
unutterable contempt. “You ask me just now to spare you my heroics; I
say the same thing now to you. Do not let us talk to each other like
the personages of a drama at the Ambigu. It is your necessities that
have made of you what you are, and that will keep you what you are, so
long as they exist, and are strong enough to push you to disagreeable
courses. Who says it is pleasant to go out of the straight line?
Not I, faith of a gentleman, Monsieur Lance! Believe me, it is more
pleasant, as well as more proper, to be virtuous than to be wicked.
Give me an annuity of a few thousand francs, and I will be the most
honourable of men. You are afraid of the work that lies before you,
because it is difficult, because it is dangerous; but not because it
is dishonourable. Let us speak frankly, and call things by their right
names. You want to inherit this old man’s fortune?”

“Yes,” answered Launcelot Darrell. “I have been taught from my babyhood
to expect it. I have a right to expect it.”

“Precisely; and you don’t want this other person, whose name you won’t
tell me, to get it.”

“No.”

“Very well, then. Do not let us have any further dispute about the
matter. Do not abuse poor Mephistopheles because he has shown the
desire to help you to gain your own ends, and has already, by decision
and promptitude of action, achieved that which you would never have
effected by yourself alone. Tell Mephistopheles to go about his
business, and he will go. But he will not stay to be made a—what
you call—an animal which is turned out into the wilderness with other
people’s sins upon his shoulders?—a scapegoat; or a paws-cat, which
pull hot chestnuts from the fire, and burn her fingers in the interests
of her friend. The chestnuts, in this case, this, are _very_ hot, my
friend; but I risk to burn my fingers with the shells in the hope to
partake the inside of the nut.”

“I never meant to make a scapegoat of you, nor a cat’s-paw,” said
Launcelot Darrell, with some alarm in his tone. “I didn’t mean to
offend you, Bourdon. You’re a very good fellow in your way, I know;
and if your notions are a little loose upon some subjects, why, as
you say, a man’s necessities are apt to get the upper hand of his
principles. If Maurice de Crespigny has chosen to make an iniquitous
will, for the mere gratification of an old madman’s whim, the
consequences of his injustice must rest on his head, not on mine.”

“Most assuredly,” cried the Frenchman, “that argument is not to be
answered. Be happy, my friend; we will bring about a posthumous
adjustment of the old man’s errors. The wrong done by this deluded
testator shall be repaired before his ashes are carried to their
resting-place. Have no fear, my friend; all is prepared, as you know,
and, let the time come when it may, we are ready to act.”

Launcelot Darrell gave a long sigh, a fretful, discontented
inspiration, that was expressive of utter weariness. This young man had
in the course of his life committed many questionable and dishonourable
actions; but he had always done such wrong as it were under protest,
and with the air of a victim, who is innocently disposed but too easily
persuaded, and who reluctantly suffers himself to be led away by the
counsels of evilminded wretches.

So now he had the air of yielding to the subtle arguments of his
friend, the agent for patent mustard.

The two men walked on in silence for some little time. They had left
the wood long ago, and were in a broad lane that led towards Hazlewood.
Launcelot Darrell strolled silently along, with his head bent and his
black eyebrows contracted. His companion’s manner had its usual dapper
airiness; but every now and then the Frenchman’s sharp greenish-blue
eyes glanced from the pathway before him to the gloomy face of the
artist.

“There is one thing that I forgot in speaking of Mrs. Monckton,”
Monsieur Bourdon said, presently; “and that is, that I fancy I have
seen her somewhere before.”

“Oh, I can account for that,” Launcelot Darrell answered, carelessly.
“I was inclined to think the same thing myself when I first saw her.
She is like George Vane’s daughter.”

“George Vane’s daughter?”

“Yes, the girl we saw on the Boulevard upon the night——”

The young man stopped abruptly, and gave another of those fretful sighs
by which he made a kind of sulky atonement for the errors of his life.

“I do not remember the daughter of George Vane,” murmured the
Frenchman, reflectively. “I know that there was a young girl with that
wearisome old Englishman—a handsome young person, with bright yellow
hair and big eyes; an overgrown child, who was not easily to be shaken
off; but I remember no more. Nevertheless, I think I have seen this
Mrs. Monckton before to-day.”

“Because, I tell you, Eleanor Monckton is like that girl. I saw the
likeness when I first came home, though I only caught one glimpse of
the face of George Vane’s daughter on the Boulevard that night. And,
if I had not had reason for thinking otherwise, I should have been
almost inclined to believe that the old schemer’s daughter had come to
Hazlewood to plot against my interests.”

“I do not understand.”

“You remember George Vane’s talk about his friend’s promise, and the
fortune that he was to inherit?”

“Yes, perfectly. We used to laugh at the poor hopeful old man.”

“You used to wonder why I took such an interest in the poor old
fellow’s talk. Heaven knows I never wished him ill, much less meant him
any harm——”

“Except so far as getting hold of his money,” murmured Monsieur
Bourdon, in an undertone.

The young man turned impatiently upon his companion.

“Why do you delight in raking up unpleasant memories?” he said, in a
half-savage, half-peevish tone. “George Vane was only one amongst many
others.”

“Most certainly! Amongst a great many others.”

“And if I happened to play _écarté_ better than most of the men we
knew——”

“To say nothing of that pretty little trick with an extra king in the
lining of your coat sleeve, which I taught you, my friend.—But about
George Vane, about the friend of George Vane, about the promise——”

“George Vane’s friend is my great-uncle, Maurice de Crespigny; and the
promise was made when the two were young men at Oxford.”

“And the promise was——”

“A romantic, boyish business, worthy of the Minerva Press. If either of
the two friends died unmarried, he was to leave all his possessions to
the other.”

“Supposing the other to survive him. But Monsieur de Crespigny cannot
leave his money to the dead. George Vane is dead. You need no longer
fear him.”

“No, I have no reason to fear _him_!”

“But of whom, then, have you fear?”

Launcelot Darrell shook his head.

“Never you mind that, Bourdon,” he said. “You’re a very clever fellow,
and a very good-natured fellow, when you please. But it’s sometimes
safest to keep one’s own secrets. You know what we talked about
yesterday. Unless I take your advice I’m a ruined man.”

“But you will take it? Having gone so far, and taken so much trouble,
and confided so much in strangers, you will surely not recede?” said
Monsieur Bourdon, in his most insinuating tones.

“If my great-uncle is dying, the crisis has come, and I must decide
one way or the other,” answered Launcelot Darrell, slowly, in a thick
voice that was strange to him. “I—I—can’t face ruin, Bourdon. I think I
_must_ take your advice.”

“I _knew_ that you would take it, my friend,” the commercial traveller
returned, quietly.

The two men turned out of the lane and climbed a rough stile leading
into a meadow that lay between them and Hazlewood. The lights burned
brightly in the lower windows of Mrs. Darrell’s house, and the clock
of the village church slowly struck six as Launcelot and his companion
crossed the meadow.

A dark figure was dimly visible, standing at a low wicket-gate that
opened from the meadow into the Hazlewood shrubbery.

“There’s my mother,” muttered Launcelot, “watching for me at the gate.
She’s heard the news, perhaps. Poor soul, if I didn’t care about the
fortune for my own sake, I should for hers. I think a disappointment
would almost kill her.”

Again a coward’s argument,—a new loophole by means of which Launcelot
Darrell tried to creep out of the responsibility of his own act, and to
make another, in a manner, accountable for his sin.




CHAPTER XL.

RESOLVED.


Eleanor Monckton walked slowly back to the house by the side of her
husband, whose eyes never left his wife’s face during that short walk
between the garden-gate and the long French window by which the two
girls had left the drawing-room. Even in the dusk, Gilbert Monckton
could see that his wife’s face was unusually pale.

She spoke to him as they entered the drawing-room, laying her hand upon
his arm as she addressed him, and looking earnestly at him in the red
firelight.

“Is Mr. de Crespigny really dying, Gilbert?” she asked.

“I fear that, from what the medical men say, there is very little doubt
about it. The old man is going fast.”

Eleanor paused for a few moments, with her head bent, and her face
hidden from her husband.

Then, suddenly looking up, she spoke to him again; this time with
intense earnestness.

“Gilbert, I want to see Mr. de Crespigny before he dies; I want to see
him alone—I must see him!”

The lawyer stared at his wife in utter bewilderment. What, in Heaven’s
name, was the meaning of this sudden energy, this intense eagerness,
which blanched the colour in her cheeks, and held her breathless? Her
friendly feeling for the invalid, her womanly pity for an old man’s
infirmities, could never have been powerful enough to cause such
emotion.

“You want to see Maurice de Crespigny, Eleanor?” repeated Mr. Monckton,
in a tone of undisguised wonder. “But why do you want to see him?”

“I have something to tell him—something that he _must_ know before he
dies.”

The lawyer started. A sudden light broke in upon his bewildered mind,—a
light that showed him the woman he loved in very odious colours.

“You want to tell him who you are?”

“To tell him who I am? yes!” Eleanor answered, absently.

“But for what reason?”

Mrs. Monckton was silent for a moment, looking thoughtfully at her
husband.

“My reason is a secret, Gilbert,” she said; “I cannot even tell it to
you—yet. But I hope to do so very, very soon. Perhaps to-night.”

The lawyer bit his under lip and walked away from his wife with a frown
upon his face. He left Eleanor standing before the fireplace, and took
two or three turns up and down the room, pacing backwards and forwards
in moody silence.

Then, suddenly returning to her, he said, with an air of angry
resolution that chilled her timid confidence in him, and cast her back
upon herself, “Eleanor, there is something in all this that wounds me
to the very quick. There is a mystery between us; a mystery that has
lasted too long. Why did you stipulate that your maiden name should be
kept a secret from Maurice de Crespigny? Why have you paid him court
ever since your coming to this place? And why, now that you hear of his
approaching death, do you want to force yourself into his presence?
Eleanor, Eleanor, there can be put one reason for all this, and that
the most sordid, the most miserable and mercenary of reasons.”

George Vane’s daughter looked at her husband with a stare of blank
dismay, as if she was trying, but trying in vain, to attach some
meaning to his words.

“A sordid reason—a mercenary reason,” she repeated, slowly, in a half
whisper.

“Yes, Eleanor,” answered Gilbert Monckton, passionately. “Why should
you be different from the rest of the world? It has been my error,
my mad delusion, to think you so; as I once thought another woman
who crushed my hopes of happiness as recklessly as a child shatters
a plaything it has got tired of. It has been my folly to trust and
believe in you, forgetful of the past, false to the teaching of
most bitter experience. I have been mistaken—once more—all the more
egregiously, perhaps, because this time I thought I was so deliberate,
so cautious. You are _not_ different to the rest of the world. If other
women are mercenary, you too are mercenary. You are not content with
having sacrificed your inclination for the sake of making what the
world calls an advantageous marriage. You are not satisfied with having
won a wealthy husband, and you seek to inherit Maurice de Crespigny’s
fortune.”

Eleanor Monckton passed both her hands across her forehead, pushing
back the loose masses of her hair, as if she would by that movement
have cleared away some of the clouds that overshadowed her brain.

“_I_ seek to inherit Mr. de Crespigny’s fortune!” she murmured.

“Yes! Your father no doubt educated you in that idea. I have heard how
obstinately he built upon the inheritance of his friend’s wealth. He
taught you to share his hopes: he bequeathed them to you as the only
legacy he had to give——”

“No!” cried Eleanor, suddenly; “the inheritance I received at my
father’s death was no inheritance of hope. Do not say any more to me,
Mr. Monckton. It seems as if my brain had no power to bear all this
to-night. If you can think these base things of me, I must be content
to endure your bad opinion. I know that I have been very forgetful of
you, very neglectful of you, since I have been your wife, and you have
reason to think badly of me. But my mind has been so full of other
things: so full, that it has seemed to me as if all else in life—except
those thoughts, that one hope—slipped by me like the events of a dream.”

Gilbert Monckton looked half-fearfully at his wife as she spoke. There
was something in her manner that he had never seen before. He had seen
her only when her feelings had been held in check by her utmost power
of repression. That power was beginning to wear out now. The strain
upon Eleanor’s intellect had been too great, and her nerves were losing
their power of tension.

“Do not say anything more to me,” she cried, imploringly; “do not say
anything more. It will soon be over now.”

“What will soon be over, Eleanor?”

But Eleanor did not answer. She clasped her hands before her face; a
half-stifled sob broke from her lips, and she hurried from the room
before her husband could repeat his question.

Mr. Monckton looked after her with an expression of unmingled anguish
on his face.

“How can I doubt the truth?” he thought; “her indignant repudiation
of any design on Maurice de Crespigny’s fortune exonerates her at
least from that charge. But her agitation, her tears, her confusion,
all betray the truth. Her heart has never been mine. She married me
with the determination to do her duty to me, and to be true to me. I
believe that. Yes, in spite of all, I will believe that. But her love
is Launcelot Darrell’s. Her love, the one blessing I sought to win,—the
blessing which in my mad folly I was weak enough to hope for,—is given
to Laura’s betrothed husband. What could be plainer than the meaning
of those last broken words she spoke just now: ‘It will soon be over;
it will soon be over?’ What should she moan except that Launcelot
Darrell’s marriage and departure will put an end to the struggle of her
life?”

Mingled with the bitterness of his grief, some feeling akin to pity had
a place in Gilbert Monckton’s heart.

He pitied her—yes, he pitied this girl, whose life it had been his
fate to overshadow. He had come between this bright young creature and
the affection of her innocent girlhood, and, presenting himself before
her in the hour of her desolation, had betrayed her into one of those
mistakes which a lifetime of honest devotion is not always able to
repair.

“She consented to marry me on the impulse of the moment, clinging to me
in her loneliness and helplessness, and blinded to the future by the
sorrow of the present. It was an instinct of confidence, and not love,
that drew her towards me; and now, now that there is no retreat—no
drawing back—nothing but a long vista of dreary years to be spent with
a man she does not love, this poor unhappy girl suffers an agony which
can no longer be concealed, even from me.”

Mr. Monckton paced up and down his spacious drawing-room, thinking of
these things. Once he looked with a sad, bitter smile at the evidences
of wealth that were so lavishly scattered about the handsome chamber.
On every side those evidences met his eyes. The Guido, upon which the
firelight gleamed, kindling the face of a martyr into supernatural
glory, was worth a sum that would have been a fortune to a poor man.
Every here and there, half hidden amongst the larger modern pictures,
lurked some tiny gem of Italian art, a few square inches of painted
canvas, worth full a hundred times its weight of unalloyed gold.

“If my wife were as frivolous as Laura,” thought Mr. Monckton, “I
could make her happy, perhaps. Fine dresses, and jewels, and pictures,
and furniture, would be enough to make happiness for an empty-headed
woman. If Eleanor had been influenced by mercenary feelings when she
married me, she would have surely made more use of my wealth; she would
have paraded the jewellery I have given her, and made herself a lay
figure for the display of milliner’s work; at least while the novelty
of her position lasted. But she has dressed as plainly as a village
tradesman’s wife, and the only money she has spent is that which she
has given to her friend the music-mistress.”

The second dinner-bell rang while Gilbert Monckton was pacing the
empty drawing-room, and he went straight to the dining-room in his
frock-coat, and with no very great appetite for the dishes that were to
be set before him.

Eleanor took her place at the top of the table. She wore a brown
silk dress, a few shades darker than her auburn hair, and her white
shoulders gleamed liked ivory against bronze. She had bathed her head
and face with cold water, and her rippling hair was still wet. She was
very pale, very grave; but all traces of violent emotion had passed
away, and there was a look of quiet determination about her mouth.

Laura Mason came rustling and fluttering into the room, as Mr. and Mrs.
Monckton took their places at the dinner-table.

“It’s my PINK,” said the young lady, alluding to a very elaborate
toilette of blush-rose coloured silk, bedizened with innumerable yards
of lace and ribbon.

“I thought you would like to see my pink, and I want to know how it
looks. It’s the new colour. Launcelot says the new colour is like
strawberry ices, but I like it. It’s one of the dinner dresses in my
trousseau, you know,” she murmured, apologetically, to Mr. Monckton;
“and I wanted to try the effect of it, though of course it’s only to
be worn at a party. The trimmings on the cross set beautifully; don’t
they, Eleanor?”

It was fortunate, perhaps, on this occasion at least, that Miss Mason
possessed the faculty of keeping up a kind of conversational monologue,
for otherwise there must have been a very dreary silence at the
dinner-table upon this particular evening.

Gilbert Monckton only spoke when the business of the meal compelled
him to do so. But there was a certain tenderness of tone in the very
few words he had occasion to address to his wife which was utterly
different to his manner before dinner. It was never Mr. Monckton’s
habit to sit long over the dismal expanse of a dessert-table; but
to-night, when the cloth had been removed and the two women left the
room, he followed them without any delay whatever.

Eleanor seated herself in a low chair by the fireplace. She had looked
at her watch twice during dinner, and now her eyes wandered almost
involuntarily to the dial of the clock upon the chimney-piece.

Her husband crossed the room and leant for a few moments over her chair.

“I am sorry for what I said this afternoon, Eleanor,” he murmured, in a
low voice; “can you forgive me?”

His wife lifted her eyes to his face. Those luminous grey eyes had a
look of mournful sweetness in them.

“Forgive you!” exclaimed Eleanor, “it is you who have so much to
forgive. But I will atone—I will atone—after to-night.”

She said these last words almost in a whisper, rather as if she had
been speaking to herself than to her husband; but Gilbert Monckton
heard those whispered syllables, and drew his own conclusions from
them. Unhappily, every word that Mrs. Monckton uttered tended to
confirm her husband’s doubts and to increase his wretchedness.

He seated himself in a reading-chair upon the opposite side of the
hearth, and, drawing a lamp close to his elbow, buried himself, or
appeared to bury himself, in his newspapers.

But every now and then the upper margin of the “Times,” or the “Post,”
or the “Athenæum,” or the “Saturday,” or whatever journal the lawyer
happened to be perusing—and he took up one after the other with a
fretful restlessness that betokened a mind ill at ease—dropped a little
lower than the level of the reader’s eyes, and Mr. Monckton looked
across the edge of the paper at his wife.

Almost every time he did so he found that Eleanor’s eyes were fixed
upon the clock.

The discovery of this fact speedily became a torture to him. He
followed his wife’s eyes to the slowly moving hands upon the enamelled
dial. He watched the minute hand as it glided from one figure to
another, marking intervals of five minutes that seemed like five hours.
Even when he tried to read, the loud ticking of the wretched timepiece
came between him and the sense of the page upon which his eyes were
fixed, and the monotonous sound seemed to deafen him.

Eleanor sat quite still in her low easy chair. Scraps of fancy-work and
open books lay upon the table beside her, but she made no effort to
beguile the evening by any feminine occupation. Laura Mason, restless
for want of employment and companionship, fluttered about the room
like some discontented butterfly, stopping every now and then before
a looking-glass to contemplate some newly-discovered effect in the
elegant costume which she called her “pink;” but Eleanor took no notice
whatever of her murmured exclamations and appeals for sympathy.

“I don’t know what’s come to you, Nelly, since your marriage,” the
young lady cried at last; after vainly trying to draw Mrs. Monckton’s
attention to the manifold beauties of gauze puffings and floating
streamers of ribbon; “you don’t seem to take any interest in life.
You’re quite a different girl to what you were at Hazlewood—before
Launcelot came home.”

Mr. Monckton threw down the “Athenæum,” and took up “Punch,” at this
juncture. He stared with a stony face at one of Mr. Leech’s most genial
cartoons, and glanced almost vengefully at the familiar double columns
of jokes. Eleanor looked away from the clock to answer her companion’s
peevish complaint.

“I am thinking of Mr. de Crespigny,” she said; “he may be dying while
we are sitting here.”

Mr. Monckton dropped “Punch,” and looked, openly this time, at his
wife’s face.

Could it be, after all, that her abstraction of manner really arose
from no deeper cause than her regret for the loss of this old man,
who was her dead father’s friend, and who had displayed an especial
affection for her?

Could it be so? No! Her words that night had revealed more than a
common sorrow such as this. They had betrayed the secret of a hidden
struggle—a woman’s grief—not easily to be repressed or overcome. There
is no knowing how long the lawyer might have sat brooding over his
troubles under cover of the newspapers, but presently he remembered
some papers which he had brought from London that afternoon, and
which it was his imperative duty—in the interests of a very important
client—to read that night.

He pushed away the lamp, rose from his low chair, and went to the door
of the drawing-room.

“I am going to my study, Eleanor;” he said; “I shall most likely spend
the rest of the evening there, and I may be obliged to be very late.
You won’t sit up for me?”

“Oh, no; not unless you wish it.”

“On no account. Good night. Good night, Laura.”

Even while his wife wished him good night, her eyes wandered uneasily
back to the clock. A quarter to ten.

“And he hasn’t once looked at my pink!” murmured Miss Mason, as her
guardian left the drawing-room.

Scarcely had the door closed when Eleanor Monckton rose from her chair.

Her flushed cheeks flamed with crimson brightness; her eyes were
lighted up as if a fire had burned in her dilated pupils.

“I am going to bed, Laura,” she said, abruptly; “I am very tired. Good
night!”

She took a candle from a table near the door, lit it, and hurried from
the room before Laura could question her or remonstrate with her.

“She doesn’t _look_ tired,” thought Miss Mason; “she looks as if she
were going to a ball; or going to have the scarletina. I think I looked
like that when I was going to have the scarletina; and when Launcelot
proposed to me.”

Five minutes after the stable-clock had struck ten, the great door of
Tolldale Priory was opened by a cautious hand, and Mrs. Monckton stole
out of her house with a woollen cloak wrapped about her, and her head
almost buried in the hood belonging to the thick winter garment. She
closed the door softly; and then, without stopping to look behind her,
hurried down the broad stone steps, across the courtyard, along the
gravelled garden pathway, out at the narrow wooden door in the wall,
and away into the dreary darkness of the wood that lay between the
Priory grounds and the dwelling-place of Maurice de Crespigny.




CHAPTER XLI.

A TERRIBLE SURPRISE.


With the chill winds of February blowing in her face, Eleanor Monckton
entered the wood between Tolldale and Mr. de Crespigny’s estate.

There were no stars in the blank grey sky above that lonely place;
black masses of pine and fir shut in the narrow path upon either side;
mysterious noises, caused by the capricious moaning of the winter wind,
sounded far away in the dark recesses of the wood, awfully distinct
amid the stillness of the night.

It was very long since Eleanor had been out alone after dark, and she
had never before been alone in the darkness of such a place as this.
She had the courage of a young lioness, but she had also a highly
nervous and sensitive nature, an imaginative temperament; and the
solemn loneliness of this wood, resonant every now and then with the
dismal cries of the night-wind, was very terrible to her. But above and
beyond every natural womanly feeling was this girl’s devotion to her
dead father; and she walked on with her thick shawl gathered closely
round her, and with both her hands pressed against her beating heart.

She walked on through the solitude and the darkness, not indifferently,
but devotedly; in sublime self-abnegation; in the heroic grandeur of a
soul that is elevated by love; as she would have walked through fire
and water, if by the endurance of such an ordeal she could have given
fresh proof of her affection for that hapless suicide of the Faubourg
Saint Antoine.

“My dear father,” she murmured once, in a low voice, “I have been slow
to act, but I have never forgotten. I have never forgotten you, lying
far away from me in that cruel foreign grave. I have waited, but I will
wait no longer. I will speak to-night.”

I think she believed that George Vane, divided from her by the awful
chasm which yawns, mysterious and unfathomable, betwixt life and death,
was yet near enough akin to her, in his changed state of being, to
witness her actions and hear her words. She spoke to him as she would
have written to him had he been very far away from her, in the belief
that her words would reach him, sooner or later.

The walk, which in the daytime seemed only a pleasant ramble, was a
weary pilgrimage under the starless winter sky. Eleanor stopped once or
twice to look back at the lighted windows of Tolldale, lying low in the
hollow behind her; and then hurried on with a quicker step.

“If Gilbert should miss me,” she thought, “what will he do? what will
he think?”

She quickened her pace even more as she thought of her husband. What
unlooked-for difficulties might she not have to combat if Mr. Monckton
should discover her absence, and send or go himself in search of her.

She had reached the outskirts of the wood by this time, and the low
gate in the iron fence—the gateway through which she had passed upon
the day when, for the first time, she saw her father’s old friend,
Maurice de Crespigny.

This gate was very rarely locked or bolted, but to-night, to her
surprise, she found it wide open.

She did not stop to wonder at this circumstance, but hurried on. She
had grown very familiar with every pathway in the grounds during her
walks beside Mr. de Crespigny’s invalid chair, and she knew the nearest
way to the house.

This nearest way was across a broad expanse of turf, and through a
shrubbery into the garden at the back of the rooms occupied by the old
man, who had for many years been unable to go up and down stairs, and
who had, for that length of time, inhabited a suite of rooms on the
ground-floor, opening with French windows on to a tiny lawn, shut in
and sheltered by a thick belt of pine and evergreens. It was in this
shrubbery that Eleanor paused for a few moments to recover her breath
after hurrying up the hill, and to reassure herself as to the safety
of the papers which she carried in the bosom of her dress—Launcelot
Darrell’s water-colour sketch, and her father’s letter. The picture
and the letter were safe. She reassured herself of this, and was about
to hurry on, when she was arrested by a sound near her. The laurel
branches close beside her had rustled, as if parted by a man’s strong
hand.

Many times in her journey through the wood, Eleanor had been terrified
by a rustling amongst the long grass about the trunks of the trees;
but each time the sight of a pheasant flying across her pathway, or a
frightened hare scudding away into the darkness, had reassured her. But
this time there could be no mistake as to what she had heard. There was
no game in Mr. de Crespigny’s garden. She was not alone, therefore.
There was a man lurking somewhere under the shadow of the evergreens.

She stopped; clutched the documents that she carried in her breast, and
then emerged from the shrubbery on to the lawn, ashamed of her fears.

The man whose presence had alarmed her was, no doubt, one of the
servants—the gardener, most likely—and he would admit her to the house
and save her any encounter with the maiden sisters.

She looked about the garden, but could see no one. Then, in a low
voice, she called to the man by name: but there was no answer.

Lights were burning in Mr. de Crespigny’s bedroom, but the windows
of the room which the old man called his study, and the windows of
his dressing-room, a little apartment between the bed-chamber and the
study, were dark.

Eleanor waited a few minutes in the garden, expecting to hear or see
one of the servants emerge from the shrubbery; but all was quiet, and
she had no alternative except to go round to the principal door of the
house, and take her chance of being admitted.

“I am certain that there was some one close to me,” she thought. “It
must have been Brooks, the gardener; but how odd that he didn’t hear me
when I called to him.”

The principal entrance to Mr. de Crespigny’s house was by a pair of
half-glass doors, approached by a double flight of stone steps, either
from the right or the left, as might suit the visitor’s convenience.
It was a handsome entrance; and the plate glass which formed the upper
halves of the doors appeared a very slight barrier between the visitor
waiting on the broad stone platform without and the interior of the
house. But, for all this, no portcullis of the Middle Ages, no sturdy
postern-gate of massive oak studded by ponderous iron nails, was ever
more impregnable to the besieger than these transparent doors had
been under the despotic sway of the rich bachelor’s maiden nieces.
Despairing poor relations, standing hopeless and desperate without
those fatal doors, had been well-nigh tempted to smash the plate-glass,
and thus make their way into the citadel. But, as this would have
scarcely been a likely method by which to ingratiate themselves into
the favour of a testy old man, the glass remained undamaged; and
the hapless kinsfolk of Maurice de Crespigny were fain to keep at
a distance and hope—almost against hope—that he would get tired of
his maiden watchers, and revenge himself upon their officiousness by
leaving his money away from them.

It was outside these glass doors that Eleanor Monckton stood to-night,
with very different feelings in her breast to those which were wont to
animate the visitors who came to Woodlands.

She pulled the brass handle of the bell, which was stiff from little
usage, and which, after resisting her efforts for a long time, gave
way at last with an angry spring that shook the distant clapper with
a noisy peal which seemed as if it would have never ceased ringing
sharply through the stillness.

But, loud as this peal had been, it was not answered immediately, and
Eleanor had time to contemplate the prim furniture of the dimly-lighted
hall, the umbrella-stand and barometer, and some marine views of a
warlike nature on the walls; pictures in which a De Crespigny of
Nelson’s time distinguished himself unpleasantly by the blowing up of
some very ugly ships, which exploded in blazes of yellow ochre and
vermilion, and the bombardment of some equally ugly fortresses in burnt
sienna.

A butler or factotum,—for there was only one male servant in the house,
and he was old and unpleasant, and had been cherished by the Misses de
Crespigny because of those very qualifications, which were likely to
stand in the way of his getting any important legacy,—emerged at last
from one of the passages at the back of the hall, and advanced, with
indignation and astonishment depicted on his grim features, to the
doors before which Eleanor waited, Heaven only knows how impatiently.

“Launcelot Darrell may have come here before me,” she thought; “he
may be with his uncle now, and may induce him to alter his will. He
must be desperate enough to do anything, if he really knows that he is
disinherited.”

The butler opened one of the hall doors a very little way, and
suspiciously. He took care to plant himself in the aperture, in such a
manner as would have compelled Eleanor to walk through his body before
she could enter the hall; and as the butler was the very reverse of Mr.
Pepper’s ghost in consistency, Mrs. Monckton could only parley with
him in the faint hope of taking the citadel by capitulation. She did
not know that the citadel was already taken, and that an awful guest,
to whom neither closely guarded doors nor oaken posterns lined with
stoutest iron formed obstacle or hindrance, had entered that quiet
mansion before her; she did not know this, nor that the butler only
kept her at bay out of the sheer force of habit, and perhaps with a
spiteful sense of pleasure in doing battle with would-be legatees.

“I want to see Mr. de Crespigny,” Eleanor cried, eagerly; “I want to
see him very particularly, if you please. I know that he will see me if
you will be so good as to tell him that I am here.”

The butler opened his mouth to speak, but before he could do so a door
opened, and Miss Lavinia de Crespigny appeared. She was very pale, and
carried a handkerchief in her hand, which she put to her eyes every now
and then; but the eyes were quite dry, and she had not been weeping.

“Who is that?” she exclaimed, sharply. “What is the matter, Parker?
Why can’t you tell the person that we can see nobody to-night?”

“I was just a-goin’ to tell her so,” the butter answered; “but it’s
Mrs. Monckton, and she says she wants to see poor master.”

He moved away from the door, as if his responsibility had ceased on the
appearance of his mistress, and Eleanor entered the hall.

“Oh, dear Miss Lavinia,” she cried, almost breathless in her eagerness,
“do let me see your uncle. I know he will not refuse to see me. I am a
favourite with him, you know. Please let me see him.”

Miss Lavinia de Crespigny applied her handkerchief to her dry eyes
before she answered Eleanor’s eager entreaty. Then she said very
slowly,—

“My beloved uncle departed this life an hour ago. He breathed his last
in my arms.”

“And in mine,” murmured Miss Sarah, who had followed her sister into
the hall.

“And I was a-standing by the bedside,” observed the butler, with
respectful firmness; “and the last words as my blessed master said
before you come into the room, Miss Lavinia, was these: ‘You’ve been a
good servant, Parker, and you’ll find you’re not forgotten.’ Yes, miss,
‘You’ll find you’re not forgotten, Parker,’ were his last words.”

The two ladies looked very sharply and rather suspiciously at Mr.
Parker, as if they were meditating the possibility of that gentleman
having fabricated a will constituting himself sole legatee.

“_I_ did not hear my dear uncle mention you, Parker,” Miss Sarah
said, stiffly; “but _we_ shall not forget any one he wished to have
remembered; you may be sure of that.”

Eleanor Monckton stood, silent and aghast, staring straight before her,
paralyzed, dumbfounded, by the tidings she had just heard.

“Dead!” she murmured at last. “Dead! dead!—before I could see him,
before I could tell him——”

She paused, looking round her with a bewildered expression in her face.

“I do not know _why_ you should be so eager to see my uncle,” said Miss
Lavinia, forgetting her assumption of grief, and becoming very genuine
in her spiteful feeling towards Eleanor, as a possible rival, “nor do
I know _what_ you can have had to say to him. But I do know that you
have not exhibited very good taste in intruding upon us at such an
hour as this, and, above all, in remaining, now that you hear the sad
affliction”—the handkerchief went to the eyes again here—“which has
befallen us. If you come here,” added Miss Lavinia, suddenly becoming
spiteful again, “in the hope of ascertaining how my uncle’s money has
been left—and it would be only like _some_ people to do so—I can give
you _no_ information upon the subject. The gardener has been sent to
Windsor to summon Mr. Lawford’s clerk. Mr. Lawford himself started some
days ago for New York on business. It’s very unlucky that he should
be away at such a time, for we put every confidence in him. However,
I suppose the clerk will do as well. He will put seals on my uncle’s
effects, I believe, and nothing will be known about the will until the
day of the funeral. But I do not think _you_ need trouble yourself upon
the subject, my dear Mrs. Monckton, as I perfectly remember my beloved
relative telling you very distinctly that he had no idea of leaving you
anything except a picture, or something of that kind. We shall be very
happy to see that you get the picture,” concluded the lady, with frigid
politeness.

Eleanor Monckton stood with one hand pushing the glossy ripples of
auburn hair away from her forehead, and with a look upon her face which
the Misses de Crespigny—whose minds had run in one very narrow groove
for the last twenty years—could only construe into some disappointment
upon the subject of the will. Eleanor recovered her self-command with
an effort, as Miss Lavinia finished speaking, and said, very quietly:

“Believe me, I do not want to inherit any of Mr. de Crespigny’s
property. I am very, very sorry that he is dead, for there was
something that I wanted to tell him before he died; something that I
ought to have told him long ago. I have been foolish—cowardly—to wait
so long.”

She said the last words not to the two ladies, but to herself; and
then, after a pause, she added, slowly:

“I hope your uncle has left his fortune to you and your sister, Miss
Lavinia. Heaven grant that he may have left it so!”

Unfortunately the Misses de Crespigny were in the humour to take
offence at anything. The terrible torture of suspense which was gnawing
at the heart of each of the dead man’s nieces disposed them to be
snappish to any one who came in their way. To them, to-night, it seemed
as if the earth was peopled by expectant legatees, all eager to dispute
for the heritage which by right was theirs.

“We are extremely obliged to you for your good wishes, Mrs. Monckton,”
Miss Sarah said, with vinegary politeness, “and we can perfectly
appreciate their sincerity. _Good_ evening.”

On this hint, the butler opened the door with a solemn flourish, and
the two ladies bowed Eleanor out of the house. The door closed behind
her, and she went slowly down the steps, lingering without purpose,
entirely bewildered by the turn that events had taken.

“Dead!” she exclaimed, in a half-whisper, “dead! I never thought that
he would die so soon. I waited, and waited, thinking that, whenever the
time came for me to speak, he would be alive to hear me; and now he is
dead, and I have lost my chance; I have lost my one chance of avenging
my father’s death. The law cannot touch Launcelot Darrell; but this old
man had the power to punish him, and would have used that power, if
he had known the story of his friend’s death. I cannot doubt that. I
cannot doubt that Maurice de Crespigny dearly loved my father.”

Eleanor Monckton stopped for a few minutes at the bottom of the steps,
trying to collect her senses—trying to think if there was anything more
for her to do.

No, there was nothing. The one chance which fortune, by a series of
events, not one of which had been of her own contriving, had thrown
into her way, was lost. She could do nothing but go quietly home, and
wait for the reading of the will, which might, or might not, make
Launcelot Darrell the owner of a noble estate.

But then she remembered Richard Thornton’s visit to Windsor, and the
inferences he had drawn from the meeting between Launcelot and the
lawyer’s clerk. Richard had most firmly believed that the property was
left away from the young man; and Launcelot Darrell’s conduct since
that day had gone far towards confirming the scene-painter’s assertion.
There was very little doubt, then, that the will which had been drawn
up by Mr. Lawford and witnessed by Gilbert Monckton, was a will that
left Maurice de Crespigny’s fortune away from Launcelot Darrell. The
old man had spoken of a duty which he meant to perform. Surely he must
have alluded to his two nieces’ devotion, and the recompense which they
had earned by their patient attendance upon him. Such untiring watchers
generally succeed in reaping the reward of their labours; and why
should it be otherwise in this case?

But then, on the other hand, the old man was fretful and capricious.
His nerves had been shattered by a long illness. How often, in the
watches of the night, he might have lain awake, pondering upon the
disposal of his wealth, and doubtful what to do with it in his desire
to act for the best! It was known that he had made other wills, and had
burned them when the humour seized him. He had had ample opportunity
for changing his mind. He had very likely destroyed the will witnessed
by Gilbert Monckton, in order to make a new one in Launcelot’s favour.

Eleanor stood at the bottom of the broad flight of steps, with her hand
upon the iron railing, thinking of all this. Then, with a regretful
sigh, she walked away from the front of the house.




CHAPTER XLII.

IN THE PRESENCE OF THE DEAD.


The rooms that had been occupied by Maurice de Crespigny were at the
back of the house, and Eleanor, returning by the way that she had come,
had occasion to pass once more through the garden and shrubbery upon
which the windows of these rooms looked.

Mrs. Monckton paused amongst the evergreens that grew near the house,
sheltering and darkening the windows with their thick luxuriance. The
Venetian shutters outside the windows of the room in which the dead
man lay were closed, and the light within shone brightly between the
slanting laths.

“Poor old man,” Eleanor murmured, as she looked mournfully towards this
death-chamber, “he was very good to me; I ought to be sorry for his
death.”

The evergreens which grew in groups on either side of the windows made
a thick screen, behind which half-a-dozen people might have safely
hidden themselves upon this moonless and starless February night.
Eleanor lingered for a few moments amongst these clustering laurels
before she emerged upon the patch of smooth turf, which was scarcely
large enough to be dignified with the title of a lawn.

As she lingered, partly because of a regretful tenderness towards the
dead man, partly because of that irresolution and uncertainty that had
taken possession of her mind from the moment in which she had heard of
his death, she was startled once more by the rustling of the branches
near her. This time she was not left long in doubt: the rustling of the
branches was followed by a hissing whisper, very cautious and subdued,
but at the same time very distinct in the stillness; and Eleanor
Monckton was not slow to recognize the accent of the French commercial
traveller, Monsieur Victor Bourdon.

“The shutters are not fastened,” this man whispered; “there is a chance
yet, _mon ami_.”

The speaker was within two paces of Eleanor, but she was hidden from
him by the shrubs. The companion to whom he had spoken was of course
Launcelot Darrell; there could be no doubt of that. But why were these
men here? Had the artist come in ignorance of his kinsman’s death,
and in the hope of introducing himself secretly into the old man’s
apartments, and thus outmanœuvring the maiden nieces?

As the two men moved nearer one of the windows of the bedchamber,
moving very cautiously, but still disturbing the branches as they went,
Eleanor drew back, and stood, motionless, almost breathless, close
against the blank wall between the long French windows.

In another moment Launcelot Darrell and his companion were standing so
close to her that she could hear their hurried breathing as distinctly
as she heard her own. The Frenchman softly drew back one of the
Venetian shutters a few inches, and peeped very cautiously through the
narrow aperture into the room.

“There is only an old woman there,” he whispered, “an old woman, very
grey, very respectable; she is asleep, I think; look and see who she
is.”

Monsieur Bourdon drew back as he spoke, making way for Launcelot
Darrell. The young man obeyed his companion, but in a half-sulky,
half-unwilling fashion, which was very much like his manner on the
Parisian Boulevard.

“Who is it?” whispered the Frenchman, as Launcelot leant forward and
peered into the lighted room.

“Mrs. Jepcott, my uncle’s housekeeper.”

“Is she a friend of yours, or an enemy?”

“A friend, I think. I know that she hates my aunts. She would rather
serve me than serve them.”

“Good. We are not going to trust Mrs. Jepcott; but it’s as well to know
that she is friendly towards us. Now listen to me, my friend; we must
have the key.”

“I suppose we must,” muttered Launcelot Darrell, very sulkily.

“You suppose we must! Bah!” whispered the Frenchman with intense
scornfulness of manner. “It is likely we should draw back, after having
gone so far as we have gone, and made such promises as we have made.
It is like you Englishmen to turn cowards at the very last, in any
difficult business like this. You are very brave and very great so long
as you can make a great noise about your honour, and your courage, and
your loyalty; so long as the drums are beating and the flags flying,
and all the world looking on to admire you. But the moment there is
anything of difficult—anything of a little hazardous, or anything of
criminal, perhaps—you draw back, you have fear. Bah! I have no patience
with you. You are a great nation, but you have never produced a great
impostor. Your Perkin Warbecks, your Stuart Pretenders, they are all
the same. They ride up hills with forty thousand men, and,”—here
Monsieur Bourdon hissed out a very big French oath, to give strength
to his assertion,—“when they get to the top they can do nothing better
than ride down again.”

It is not to be supposed that, in so critical a situation as that in
which the two men had placed themselves, the Frenchman would have said
all this without a purpose. He knew Launcelot Darrell, and he knew
that ridicule was the best spur with which to urge him on when he was
inclined to come to a standstill. The young man’s pride took fire at
his companion’s scornful banter.

“What do you want me to do?” he asked.

“I want you to go into that room and look for your uncle’s keys. I
would do it, and perhaps do it better than you, but if that woman woke
and found me there, she would rouse the house; if she wakes up and sees
you, any sentimental story of your desire to look for the last time
upon your kinsman and benefactor will satisfy her and stop her mouth.
_You_ must search for the keys, Monsieur Robert Lance, pardon!—Monsieur
Launcelot Darrell.”

The young man made no immediate answer to this speech. He stood close
to the window, with the half-open shutter in his hand, and Eleanor
could see, by the motion of this shutter, that he was trembling.

“I can’t do it, Bourdon,” he gasped, after a long pause; “I can’t do
it. To go up to that dead man’s bedside and _steal_ his keys. It seems
like an act of sacrilege—I—I—_can’t_ do it.”

The commercial traveller shrugged his shoulders so high that it almost
seemed he never meant to bring them down again.

“Good!” he said, “_C’est fini!_ Live and die a pauper, Monsieur
Darrell, but never again ask me to help you in a great scheme. Good
night.”

The Frenchman made a show of walking off, but went slowly, and gave
Launcelot plenty of time to stop him.

“Stay, Bourdon,” the young man muttered; “don’t be a fool. If you mean
to stand by me in this business, you must have a little patience. I’ll
do what must be done, of course, however unpleasant it may be. I’ve no
reason to feel any great compunction about the old man. He hasn’t shown
so much love for me that I need have any very sentimental affection for
him. I’ll go in and look for the keys.”

He had opened the shutter to its widest extent, and he put his hand
upon the window as he spoke, but the Frenchman checked him.

“What are you going to do?” asked Monsieur Bourdon.

“I’m going to look for the keys.”

“Not that way. If you open that window the cold air will blow into the
room and awaken the old woman—what you call her—Madame Jepcott. No, you
must take off your boots, and go in through one of the windows of the
other rooms. We saw just now that those rooms are empty. Come with me.”

The two men moved away towards the windows of the sitting-room.
Eleanor crept to the Venetian shutters which Launcelot had closed,
and, drawing one of them a little way open, looked into the room in
which the dead man lay. The housekeeper, Mrs. Jepcott, sat in a roomy
easy-chair, close to the fire, which burned brightly, and had evidently
been very lately replenished. The old woman’s head had fallen back
upon the cushion of her chair, and the monotonous regularity of her
snores gave sufficient evidence of the soundness of her slumbers.
Voluminous curtains of dark green damask were drawn closely round the
massive four-post bed; a thick wax candle, in an old-fashioned silver
candlestick, burned upon the table by the bedside, and a pair of
commoner candles, in brass candlesticks, brought, no doubt, from the
housekeeper’s room, stood upon a larger table near the fireplace.

Nothing had been disturbed since the old man’s death. The maiden ladies
had made a merit of this.

“We shall disturb nothing,” Miss Lavinia, who was the more loquacious
of the two, had said; “we shall not pry about or tamper with any of our
beloved relative’s effects. You will take care of everything in your
master’s room, Jepcott; we place everything under your charge, and you
will see that nothing is touched; you will take care that not so much
as a pocket-handkerchief shall be disturbed until Mr. Lawford’s clerk
comes from Windsor.”

In accordance with these directions, everything had remained exactly
as it had been left at the moment of Maurice de Crespigny’s death. The
practised sick-nurse had retired, after doing her dismal duty; the
stiffening limbs had been composed in the last calm sleep; the old
man’s eyelids had been closed upon the sightless eyeballs; the curtains
had been drawn; and that was all.

The medicine bottles, the open Bible, the crumpled handkerchiefs, the
purse, and paper-knife, and spectacles, and keys, lying in disorder
upon the table by the bed, had not been touched. Eager as the dead
man’s nieces were to know the contents of his will, the thought of
obtaining that knowledge by any surreptitious means had never for one
moment entered into the head of either. They were conscientious ladies,
who attended church three times upon a Sunday, and who would have
recoiled aghast from before the mere thought of any infraction of the
law.

Eleanor, with the Venetian shutter a very little way open, and with her
face close against the window, stood looking into the lighted room, and
waiting for Launcelot Darrell to appear.

The great four-post bedstead stood opposite the windows; the door was
on Eleanor’s right hand. About five minutes elapsed before there was
any sign of the intruder’s coming. Then the door was opened, very
slowly, and Launcelot Darrell crept into the room.

His face was almost livid, and he trembled violently. At first he
looked helplessly about him, as if paralyzed by fear. Then he took a
handkerchief from his pocket, and wiped the cold perspiration from his
forehead, still looking helplessly right and left.

But presently the Frenchman’s head appeared round the edge of the door,
which Launcelot Darrell had left a little way open, a fat little hand
pointed to the table by the bed, and Monsieur Bourdon’s hissing whisper
vibrated in the room.

“V’là,—the table—the table—straight before you.”

Following this indication, the young man began with trembling hands to
search amongst the disorder of the littered table. He had not occasion
to seek very long for what he wanted. The dead man’s keys lay under one
of the handkerchiefs. They jingled a little as Launcelot took them up,
and Mrs. Jepcott stirred in her sleep, but she did not open her eyes.

“Come away, come!” whispered the Frenchman, as Launcelot stood with
the keys in his hand, as if too much bewildered even to know that his
purpose was accomplished. He obeyed Monsieur Bourdon, and hurried from
the room. He had taken off his boots at his companion’s instigation,
and his stockinged feet made no sound upon the thick carpet.

“What is he going to do with those keys?” Eleanor thought. “If he knows
the contents of the will, as Richard believed, what good can the keys
be to him?”

She still looked into the lighted bed-chamber, wondering what could
happen next. Where had Launcelot Darrell gone, and what was he going to
do with the keys? She crept along by the side of the house, past the
window of the dressing-room, which was still dark, and stopped when
she came to the window of the old man’s study. All the windows upon
this floor were in the same style—long French windows, opening to the
ground, and they were all sheltered by Venetian shutters. The shutters
of the study were closed, but the window was open, and through the bars
of the shutters Eleanor saw a faint glimmer of light.

She drew the shutter nearest her a little way open, and looked into the
room. The light that she had seen came from a very small bull’s-eye
lantern, which the Frenchman held in his hand. He was standing over
Launcelot Darrell, who was on his knees before the lower half of an
old-fashioned _secrétaire_, at which Mr. de Crespigny had been in the
habit of writing, and in which he had kept papers.

The lower half of this _secrétaire_ contained a great many little
drawers, which were closed in by a pair of inlaid ebony doors. The
doors were open now, and Launcelot Darrell was busy examining the
contents of the drawers one by one. His hands still trembled, and he
went to work slowly and awkwardly. The Frenchman, whose nerves appeared
in no way shaken, contrived to throw the light of the bull’s-eye always
upon the papers in the young man’s hand.

“Have you found what you want?” he asked.

“No, there’s nothing yet; nothing but old leases, receipts, letters,
bills.”

“Be quick! Remember we have to put the keys back, and to get away. Have
you the other ready?”

“Yes.”

They spoke in whispers, but their whispers were perhaps more distinct
than their ordinary tones would have been. Eleanor could hear every
word they said.

There was a long pause, during which Launcelot Darrell opened and shut
several drawers, taking a hurried survey at their contents. Presently
he uttered a half-smothered cry.

“You’ve got it?” exclaimed the Frenchman.

“Yes.”

“Put in the substitute, then, and lock the cabinet.”

Launcelot Darrell threw the document which he had taken from the drawer
upon a chair near him, and took another paper from his pocket. He put
this second paper in the place from which he had taken the first, and
then shut the drawer, and closed and locked the doors of the cabinet.
He did all this in nervous haste, and neither he nor his companion
perceived that a third paper, very much like the first in shape and
size, had fallen out of one of the drawers and lay upon the carpet
before the cabinet.

Now, for the first time, Eleanor Monckton began to comprehend the
nature of the conspiracy which she had witnessed. Launcelot Darrell
and his accomplice had substituted a fictitious paper for the real
will signed by Maurice de Crespigny and witnessed by Gilbert Monckton
and the lawyer’s clerk. The genuine document was that which Launcelot
Darrell had flung upon the chair by the side of the _secrétaire_.




CHAPTER XLIII.

A BRIEF TRIUMPH.


Eleanor Monckton’s first impulse was to rush into the room and denounce
Launcelot Darrell in the presence of those who would be sure to come in
answer to her call. He would be scarcely likely to find much mercy at
the hands of his aunts: he would stand before them a detected wretch,
capable of any crime, of any treachery, for the furtherance of his own
interest.

But a second impulse, as rapid as the first, restrained the impetuous
girl. She wanted to know the end, she wanted to see what these two
plotters would do next. Under the influence of her desire to rush into
the room, she had moved forward a few paces, rustling the leaves about
her as she stirred. The Frenchman’s acute hearing had detected that
rustling sound.

“Quick, quick,” he whispered; “take the keys back; there is some one in
the garden.”

Launcelot Darrell had risen from his knees. The door between the study
and the dressing-room had been left ajar; the young man pushed it open,
and hurried away with the keys in his hand, Victor Bourdon closed
his lantern, and came to the window. He thrust aside the Venetian
shutters, and stepped out into the garden. Eleanor crouched down with
her back flat against the wall, completely sheltered by the laurels.
The Frenchman commenced his search amongst the bushes on the right of
the window. Eleanor’s hiding-place was on the left. This gave her a
moment’s breathing time.

“The will!” she thought in that one moment; “they have left the genuine
will upon the chair by the cabinet. _If_ I could get that!”

The thought had flashed like lightning through her brain. Reckless in
her excitement, she rose from her crouching position, and slid rapidly
and noiselessly across the threshold of the open window into the study,
before Victor Bourdon had finished his examination of the shrubs on the
right.

Her excitement seemed to intensify every sense. The only light in the
room was a faint ray which came across the small intermediate chamber
from the open door of Maurice de Crespigny’s bedroom. This light was
very little, but the open door was opposite the cabinet, and what light
there was fell upon the very spot towards which Eleanor’s dilated eyes
looked. She could see the outline of the paper on the chair; she could
see the other paper on the floor, faint and grey in the dim glimmer
from the distant candles.

She snatched the will from the chair, and thrust it into the pocket of
her dress; she picked up the other paper from the floor, and placed
it on the chair. Then, with her face and figure obscured in the loose
cloak that shrouded her, she went back into the garden.

As she drew back into the shelter of the laurels she felt a man’s
garments brushing against her own, and a man’s hot breath upon her
cheek. The Frenchman had passed her so closely that it was almost
impossible he could have failed to perceive her presence; and yet he
had seemed utterly unconscious of it.

Launcelot Darrell came back to the study almost the moment after
Eleanor had left it. He was breathing quickly, and stopped to wipe his
forehead once more with his handkerchief.

“Bourdon!” he exclaimed, in a loud whisper. “Bourdon, where are you?”

The Frenchman crossed the threshold of the window as the young man
called to him.

“I have been on the look-out for spies,” he said.

“Have you seen any one?”

“No; I fancy it was a false alarm.”

“Come, then,” said Launcelot Darrell, “we have been luckier than I
thought we should be.”

“Hadn’t you better unlock that door before we leave?” asked Monsieur
Bourdon, pointing to the door which communicated with the other part of
the house. Launcelot had locked it on first entering the study, and had
thus secured himself from any surprise in that direction. The two men
were going away when Monsieur Bourdon stopped suddenly.

“You’ve forgotten something, my friend,” he whispered, laying his hand
on Launcelot’s shoulder.

“What?”

“The will, the genuine will,” answered the Frenchman, pointing to the
chair. “It would be a clever thing to leave that behind, eh!”

Launcelot started, and put his hand to his forehead.

“I must be mad,” he muttered; “this business is too much for my brain.
Why did you lead me into it, Bourdon? Are you the Devil, that you must
always prompt me to some new mischief?”

“You shall ask me that next week, my friend, when you are the master
of this house. Get that paper there, and come away: unless you want to
stop till your maiden aunts make their appearance.”

Launcelot Darrell snatched up the paper which Eleanor had put upon the
chair by the cabinet. He was going to thrust it into his breast-pocket,
when the Frenchman took it away from him.

“You don’t particularly want to keep that document; or to drop it
anywhere about the garden; do you? We’ll burn it, if it’s all the
same to you, and save them all trouble at—what you call your law
court—Common doctors, Proctor’s Commons, eh?”

Monsieur Bourdon had put his bull’s-eye lantern in his coat-pocket,
after looking for spies amongst the evergreens. He now produced a box
of fusees, and setting one of them alight, watched it fizz and sparkle
for a moment, and then held it beneath the corner of the document in
his left hand.

The paper was slow to catch fire, and Monsieur Bourdon had occasion to
light another fusee before he succeeded in doing more than scorching
it. But it blazed up by-and-by, and by the light of the blaze Eleanor
Monckton saw the eager faces of the two men. Launcelot Darrel’s
livid countenance was almost like that of a man who looks on at an
assassination. The commercial traveller watched the slow burning of
the document with a smile upon his face—a smile of triumph, as it
seemed to Eleanor Monckton.

“V’là!” he exclaimed, as the paper dropped, a frail sheet of tinder,
from his hand, and fluttered slowly to the ground. “V’là!” he cried,
stamping upon the feathery grey ashes; “so much for that; and now our
little scheme of to-night is safe, I fancy, my friend.”

Launcelot Darrell drew a long breath.

“Thank God, it’s over,” he muttered. “I wouldn’t go through this
business again for twenty fortunes.”

Eleanor, still crouching upon the damp grass close against the wall,
waited for the two men to go away. She waited, with her hands clasped
upon her heart; thinking of her triumph.

The vengeance had come at last. That which she had said to Richard
Thornton was about to be fulfilled. The law of the land had no power to
punish Launcelot Darrell for the cowardly and treacherous act that had
led to an old man’s most miserable death: but the traitor had by a new
crime placed himself at the mercy of the law.

“The will he has placed in the cabinet is a forgery,” she thought; “and
I have the real will in my pocket. He cannot escape me now,—he cannot
escape me now! His fate is in my hands.”

The two men had walked past the laurels out on to the grass-plat.
Eleanor rose from her crouching position, rustling the branches as she
did so. At the same moment she heard voices in the distance, and saw a
light gleaming through the leaves.

One of the voices that she had heard was her husband’s.

“So much the better,” she thought. “I will tell him what Launcelot
Darrell is. I will tell him to-night.”

The voices and the lights came nearer, and she heard Gilbert Monckton
say:

“Impossible, Miss Sarah. Why should my wife stop here? She must have
gone back to Tolldale; and I have been unlucky enough to miss her on
the way.”

The lawyer had scarcely spoken when, by the light of the lantern which
he held, he saw Launcelot Darrell making off into the shrubbery that
surrounded the grass-plat. The young man had not succeeded in escaping
from the open space into this friendly shelter before Gilbert Monckton
perceived him. Monsieur Bourdon, perhaps better accustomed to take to
his heels, had been more fortunate, and had plunged in amongst the
evergreens at the first sound of the lawyer’s voice.

“Darrell!” cried Mr. Monckton, “what in Heaven’s name brings you here?”

The young man stood for a few moments, irresolute, and sullen-looking.

“I’ve as good a right to be here as any one else, I suppose,” he said.
“I heard of my uncle’s death—and—and—I came to ascertain if there was
any truth in the report.”

“You heard of my beloved uncle’s death!” cried Miss Sarah de
Crespigny, peering sharply at her nephew from under the shadow of a
pent-house-like garden-hood, in which she had invested herself before
venturing into the night air. “How _could_ you have heard of the sad
event? My sister and I gave special orders that no report should go
abroad until to-morrow morning.”

Mr. Darrell did not care to say that one of the Woodlands servants was
in his pay; and that the same servant, being no other than Brooks, the
gardener, had galloped over to Hazlewood, to communicate the tidings of
his master’s death, before starting for Windsor.

“I _did_ hear of it,” Launcelot said, “and that’s enough. I came to
ascertain if it was true.”

“But you were going away from the house when I saw you!” said Mr.
Monckton, rather suspiciously.

“I was not going away from the house, for I had not been to the house,”
Launcelot answered, in the same tone as before.

He spoke in a sulky, grudging manner, because he knew that he was
telling a deliberate lie. He was a man who always did wrong acts under
protest, as being forced to do them by the injustice of the world; and
held society responsible for all his errors.

“Have you seen my wife?” Gilbert asked, still suspiciously.

“No. I have only this moment come. I have not seen anybody.”

“I _must_ have missed her,” muttered the lawyer, with an anxious air.
“I must have missed her between this and Tolldale. Nobody saw her leave
the house. She went out without leaving any message, and I guessed at
once that she had come up here. It’s very odd.”

“It _is_ very odd!” Miss Sarah repeated, with spiteful emphasis.
“I must confess that for my own part I do not see what motive Mrs.
Monckton could have had for rushing up here in the dead of the night.”

The time which Miss Sarah de Crespigny spoke of as the dead of the
night had been something between ten and eleven o’clock. It was now
past eleven.

The lawyer and Miss de Crespigny walked slowly along the gravelled
pathway that led from the grass-plat and shrubbery to the other side
of the house. Launcelot Darrell went with them, lounging by his aunt’s
side, with his head down, and his hands in his pockets, stopping now
and then to kick the pebbles from his pathway.

It was impossible to imagine anything more despicable than, this
young man’s aspect. Hating himself for what he had done; hating the
man who had prompted him to do it; angry against the very workings of
Providence—since by his reasoning it was Providence, or his Destiny, or
some power or other against which he had ample ground for rebellion,
that had caused all the mischief and dishonour of his life—he went
unwillingly to act out the part which he had taken upon himself, and to
do his best to throw Gilbert Monckton off the scent.

His mind was too much disturbed for him to be able clearly to realize
the danger of his position. To have been seen there was ruin—perhaps!
If by-and-by any doubts should arise as to the validity of the will
that would be found in Maurice de Crespigny’s _secrétaire_, would it
not be remembered that he, Launcelot Darrell, had been seen lurking
about the house on the night of the old man’s death, and had been only
able to give a very lame explanation of his motives for being there. He
thought of this as he walked by his aunt’s side. He thought of this,
and began to wonder if it might not be possible to undo what had been
done? No, it was impossible. The crime had been committed. A step had
been taken which could never be retraced, for Victor Bourdon had burned
the real will.

“Curse his officiousness,” thought the young man. “I could have undone
it all but for that.”

As the lawyer and his two companions reached the angle of the house
on their way to the front entrance, whence Mr. Monckton, and Miss de
Crespigny had come into the garden, a dark figure, shrouded in a loose
cloak, emerged from amidst the shrubs by the windows of the dead man’s
apartments, and approached them.

“Who is that?” cried the lawyer, suddenly. His heart began to beat
violently as he asked the question. It was quite a supererogatory
question; for he knew well enough that it was his wife who stood before
him.

“It is I, Gilbert,” Eleanor said, quietly.

“You here, Mrs. Monckton!” exclaimed her husband, in a harsh voice,
that seemed to ring through the air like the vibration of metal that
has been struck—“you here, hiding in this shrubbery!”

“Yes, I came here—how long ago, Miss Sarah? It seems half a century to
me.”

“You came here exactly twenty minutes ago, Mrs. Monckton,” Miss de
Crespigny answered, icily.

“And by a really remarkable coincidence,” cried Gilbert Monckton, in
the same unnatural voice in which he had spoken before, “Mr. Darrell
happens to be here too: only I must do you the justice to say, Mrs.
Monckton, that _you_ appear less discomposed than the gentleman. Ladies
always have the advantage of us; they can carry off these things so
easily; deception seems to come natural to them.”

“Deception!” repeated Eleanor.

What did he mean? Why was he angry with her? She wondered at his manner
as she walked with him to the house. No suspicion of the real nature
of her husband’s feelings entered her mind. The absorbing idea of her
life was the desire to punish her father’s destroyer; and how could she
imagine that her husband was tortured by jealous suspicions of this
man: of this man, who of all the living creatures upon the earth was
most hateful to her? How could she—knowing her own feelings, and taking
it for granted that these feelings were more or less obvious to other
people—how could she imagine the state of Gilbert Monckton’s mind?

She went into the hall with her husband, followed by Miss Sarah
de Crespigny and Launcelot Darrell, and from the hall into the
sitting-room usually occupied by the two ladies. A lamp burned brightly
upon the centre table, and Miss Lavinia de Crespigny sat near it, with
some devotional book in her hand. I think she tried her best to be
devout, and to employ herself with serious reflections upon the dread
event that had so lately happened; but the fatal power of the old man’s
wealth was stronger than any holier influence, and I fear that Miss
Lavinia’s thoughts very often wandered away from the page on which her
eyes were fixed, into sundry intricate calculations of the cumulative
interest upon Exchequer bills, India five per cents., and Great Western
Railway shares.

“I must have an explanation of this business,” Mr. Monckton said: “it
is time that we should all understand each other. There has been too
much mystification, and I am most heartily tired of it.”

He walked to the fireplace and leaned his elbow upon the marble
chimney-piece. From this position he commanded a view of every one in
the room. Launcelot Darrell flung himself into a chair by the table,
nearly opposite his aunt Lavinia. He did not trouble himself to notice
this lady, nor did he bow to Eleanor; he sat with his elbow resting
upon the arm of his chair, his chin in the palm of his hand, and he
employed himself by biting his nails and beating his heel upon the
carpet. He was still thinking, as he had thought in the garden, “If I
could only undo what I have done. If I could only undo the work of the
last quarter of an hour, and stand right with the world again.”

But in this intense desire that had taken possession of Launcelot
Darrell’s mind there was mingled no regretful horror of the wickedness
of what he had done; no remorseful sense of the great injustice which
he had plotted; no wish to atone or to restore. It was selfishness
alone that influenced his every thought. He wanted to put _himself_
right. He hated this new position, which for the last few minutes
he had occupied for the first time in his life; the position of a
deliberate criminal, amenable to the laws by which the commonest felons
are tried, likely to suffer as the commonest felons suffer.

It seemed to him as if his brain had been paralyzed until now; it
seemed to him as if he had acted in a stupor or a dream; and that he
now for the first time comprehended the nature of the deed which he had
done, and was able to foresee the possible consequences of his own act.

“I have committed forgery,” he thought. “If my crime is discovered I
shall be sent to Bermuda to work amongst gangs of murderous ruffians
till I drop down dead. _If_ my crime is discovered! How shall I ever be
safe from discovery, when I am at the mercy of the wretches who helped
me?”

Eleanor threw off her cloak, but she refused to sit down in the chair
which Miss Sarah offered her. She stood divided by the width of
half the room from her husband, with her face fronting his, in the
full glare of the lamplight. Her large grey eyes were bright with
excitement, her cheeks were flushed, her hair fell loosely about her
face, brown in the shadow, and glittering like ruddy gold in the light.

In all the beauty of her girlhood, from the hour in which Gilbert
Monckton had first seen her until to-night, she had never looked so
beautiful as she looked now. The sense that she had triumphed, the
thought that she held the power to avenge her father’s death, lent an
unnatural brilliancy to her loveliness. She was no longer an ordinary
woman, only gifted with the earthly charms of lovely womanhood: she was
a splendid Nemesis, radiant with a supernatural beauty.




CHAPTER XLIV.

LOST.


“You asked me why I came here to-night,” she said, looking at her
husband. “I will tell you, Gilbert: but I must tell you a long story
first, almost all the story of my life.”

Her voice, resonant and musical, roused Launcelot Darrell from his
gloomy abstraction. He looked up at Eleanor, and for the first time
began to wonder how and why she had come there. They had met her in the
garden. Why had she been there? What had she been doing there? Could
it be possible that she had played the spy upon him? No! Surely there
could be no fear of that? What reason should _she_ have for suspecting
or watching him? _That_ terror was too cowardly, too absurd, he
thought; but such foolish and unnecessary fears would be the perpetual
torment of his life henceforward.

“You remember, Gilbert,” Eleanor continued, “that when I promised to be
your wife, I told you my real name, and asked you to keep that name a
secret from the people in this house; and from Launcelot Darrell.”

“Yes,” answered Mr. Monckton, “I remember.”

Even in the midst of the tortures which arose out of his jealousy and
suspicion, and which to-night had reached their climax, and had taken
entire possession of the lawyer’s mind, there was some half-doubtful
feeling of wonder at Eleanor’s calm and self-assured manner.

And yet she was deceiving him. He knew that. He had long ago determined
that this second hazard of his life was to result in ignominious
failure, like the first. He had been deceived before; gulled,
hoodwinked, fooled, jilted: and the traitress had smiled in his face,
with the innocent smile of a guileless child. Eleanor was perhaps even
more skilled in treachery than that first traitress; but that was all.

“I will not be deluded by her again,” he thought, as he looked gloomily
at the beautiful face opposite to him: “_nothing_ she can say shall
make me her dupe again.”

“Shall I tell you why I asked you to keep that secret for me, Gilbert?”
continued Eleanor. “I did so because I had a motive for coming back to
the neighbourhood of this place. A motive that was stronger than my
love for you—though I did love you, Gilbert, better than I thought; if
I thought at all of anything except that other motive which was the one
purpose of my life.”

Mr. Monckton’s upper lip curled scornfully. Love him! That was too poor
a fancy. What had he ever been but a dupe and a cat’s-paw for a false
woman; fooled and cheated many years ago in his early manhood; fooled
and cheated to-day in his prime of life. He smiled contemptuously at
the thought of his own folly.

“Launcelot Darrell,” cried Eleanor, suddenly, in an altered voice,
“shall I tell _you_ why I was so eager to come back to this
neighbourhood? Shall I tell you why I wanted the secret of my name kept
from you and from your kindred?”

The young man lifted his head and looked at Eleanor. Wonder and terror
were both expressed in his countenance. He wondered why Gilbert
Monckton’s wife addressed him with such earnestness. He was afraid,
without knowing what he feared.

“I don’t know what you mean, Mrs. Monckton,” he faltered. “What could
I have to do with your false name, or your coming back to this place?”

“EVERYTHING!” cried Eleanor: “it was to be near you that I came back
here.”

“I thought as much,” muttered the lawyer, under his breath.

“It was to be near you that I came back,” Eleanor repeated; “it was
to be near you, Launcelot Darrell, that I was so eager to come back:
so eager, that I would have stooped to any stratagem, encountered any
risk, if by so doing I could have hastened my return. It was for this
that I took the most solemn step a woman can take, without stopping
to think of its solemnity. It was to deceive you that I kept my name
a secret. It was to denounce you as the wretch who cheated a helpless
old man out of the money that was not his own, and thus drove him to
a shameful and a sinful death, that I came here. I have watched and
waited long for this moment. It has come at last. Thank Heaven, it has
come at last!”

Launcelot Darrell rose suddenly from his chair. His white face was
still turned towards Eleanor; his eyes were fixed in a stare of horror.
At first, perhaps, he contemplated rushing out of the room, and getting
away from this woman, who had recalled the sin of the past, at a
moment when his brain was maddened by the crime of the present. But he
stopped, fascinated by some irresistible power in the beautiful face
before him. Eleanor stood between the coward and the door. He could not
pass her.

“You know who I am now, Launcelot Darrell, and you know how much mercy
you can expect from me,” this girl continued, in the clear, ringing
voice in which she had first addressed her enemy. “You remember the
eleventh of August. You remember the night upon which you met my father
upon the Boulevard. I stood by his side upon that night. I was hanging
upon his arm, when you and your vile associate tempted him away from
me. Heaven knows how dearly I loved him; Heaven knows how happily I
looked forward to a life in which I might be with him and work for
him. Heaven only knows how happily that bright dream might have been
realized—but for you—but for you. May an old man’s sin rest upon your
head. May a daughter’s blighted hope rest upon your head. You can
guess now why I am here to-night, and what I have been doing; and you
can guess, perhaps, what mercy you have to expect from George Vane’s
daughter.”

“George Vane’s daughter!”

Sarah and Lavinia de Crespigny lifted up their hands and eyes in mute
dismay. Was this woman, this viper, who had gained access to the very
heart of the citadel which they had guarded so jealously, the very
creature who of all others they would have kept remote from the dead
man?

No! it was impossible. Neither of Maurice de Crespigny’s nieces had
ever heard of the birth of George Vane’s youngest child. The old man
had received tidings of the little girl’s advent in a letter sent by
stealth, and had kept the intelligence a secret.

“It is too absurd!” Miss Lavinia exclaimed; “George Vane’s
youngest daughter is Hortensia Bannister, and she must be at least
five-and-thirty years of age.”

Launcelot Darrell knew better than this. _He_ could recall a dismal
scene that had occurred in the pale grey light of an August morning.
He could remember a white-haired old man, sitting amidst the sordid
splendour of a second-rate coffee-house, crying about his youngest
daughter, and bewailing the loss of the money that was to have paid for
his darling’s education; a wretched, broken-hearted old man, who had
held his trembling hands aloft, and cursed the wretch who had cheated
him.

He could see the figure now, with the shaking hands lifted high. He
could see the wrinkled face, very old and worn, in that grey morning
light, and tears streaming from the faded blue eyes. He had lived under
the shadow of that curse ever since, and it seemed as if it was coming
home to him to-night.

“I am Eleanor Vane,” Gilbert Monckton’s wife said, in answer to Miss
Lavinia. “I am Hortensia Bannister’s half-sister. It was because of her
foolish pride that I came to Hazlewood under a false name. It was in
order to be revenged upon Launcelot Darrell that I have since kept my
real name a secret.”

Eleanor Vane! Eleanor Vane! Could it be true? Of all whom Launcelot
Darrell had reason to fear, this Eleanor Vane was the most to be
dreaded. If he had never wronged her father, even if he had not been
indirectly the cause of the old man’s death, he would still have had
reason to fear Eleanor Vane. He knew what that reason was, and he
dropped back into his chair, livid and trembling, as he had trembled
when he stole the keys from his dead uncle’s bedside.

“Maurice de Crespigny and my father were bosom friends,” continued
Eleanor. Her voice changed as she spoke of her father, and the light in
her face faded as a tender shadow stole over her countenance. She could
not mention her father’s name without tenderness, speak of him when or
where she might. “They were bosom friends; everybody here knows that;
and my poor dear father had a foolish fancy that if Mr. de Crespigny
died before him, he would inherit this house and estate, and that he
would be rich once more, and that we should be very happy together. _I_
never thought that.”

Launcelot Darrell looked up with a strange, eager glance, but said
nothing. The sisters, however, could not suffer Eleanor’s words to pass
without remark.

“You never thought that; oh dear no, I dare say not,” Miss Lavinia
observed.

“Of course you never entered this house with any mercenary ideas upon
the subject of my dear uncle’s will,” Miss Sarah exclaimed, with biting
irony.

“I never built any hope upon my dear father’s fancy,” resumed Eleanor,
so indifferent to the remarks of the two ladies that it seemed as
if they had been unheard by her; “but I humoured it as I would have
humoured any fancy of his, however foolish. But after his death I
remembered that Mr. de Crespigny had been his friend, and I only waited
to convince myself of that man’s guilt”—she pointed to Launcelot
Darrell as she spoke—“before I denounced him to his great-uncle. I
thought that my father’s old friend would listen to me, and knowing
what had been done, would never let a traitor inherit his wealth. I
thought that by this means I should be revenged upon the man who caused
my father’s death. I heard to-day that Mr. de Crespigny had not long
to live; and when I came here to-night I came with the intention of
telling him the real character of the man who was perhaps to inherit
his fortune.”

The maiden ladies looked at each other. It would not have been a bad
thing, perhaps, after all, if Eleanor had arrived in time to see the
dying man. It was a pity that Maurice de Crespigny should have died in
ignorance of his nephew’s character, when there was just a chance that
he might have left a will in that nephew’s favour. But on the other
hand, George Vane’s daughter was even a more formidable person than
Launcelot. Who could tell how she might have contrived to tamper with
the old man?

“I have no doubt you wished to denounce Mr. Darrell; and to denounce
us, too, for the matter of that, I dare say,” observed Miss Sarah, “in
order that you yourself might profit by my uncle’s will.”

“_I_ profit!” cried Eleanor; “what should I want with the poor old
man’s money?”

“My wife is rich enough to be above any suspicion of that kind, Miss de
Crespigny,” Gilbert Monckton said, proudly.

“I came too late,” Eleanor said; “I came too late to see my father’s
friend, but not too late for what I have so long prayed for—revenge
upon my father’s destroyer. Look at your sister’s son, Miss de
Crespigny. Look at him, Miss Lavinia; you have good reason to be proud
of him. He has been a liar and a traitor from first to last; and
to-night he has advanced from treachery to crime. The law could not
punish him for the cruelty that killed a helpless old man; the law can
punish him for that which he has done to-night, for he has committed a
crime.”

“A crime!”

“Yes. He has crept like a thief into the house in which his uncle lies
dead, and has introduced some document—a will of his own fabrication,
no doubt—in the place of the genuine will left in Mr. de Crespigny’s
private _secrétaire_.”

“How do _you_ know this, Eleanor?” cried Gilbert Monckton.

“I know it because I was outside the window of the study when he
changed the papers in the cabinet, and because I have the real will in
my possession.”

“It is a lie!” shouted Launcelot Darrell, starting to his feet, “a
damnable lie, the real will——”

“Was burnt, as you think, Mr. Darrell; but you are mistaken, the
document which your friend, Monsieur Victor Bourdon, burnt was a paper
which you dropped out of the _secrétaire_ while you were searching for
the will.”

“And where is the genuine document, Eleanor?” Gilbert asked.

“Here,” answered his wife, triumphantly.

She put her hand into her pocket. It was empty. The will was gone.




CHAPTER XLV.

AT SEA.


The will was gone. Eleanor tried to think how or where she could have
lost it. It might have dropped from her pocket, perhaps. That was the
only solution of the mystery that presented itself to her mind. The
open pocket of her dress might have been caught by one of the laurel
boughs as she crouched upon the ground, and when she rose the paper
had dropped out. There was no other way in which she _could_ have lost
it. She had been so absorbed in the watch she had kept on Launcelot
Darrell, as to forget the value of the document which she had thrust
carelessly into her pocket. Her father’s letter and Launcelot Darrell’s
sketch were still safe in the bosom of her dress; but the will, the
genuine will, in place of which the young man had introduced some
fabrication of his own, was gone.

“Let me see this will, Eleanor,” Gilbert Monckton said, advancing to
his wife. Although she had been the most skilful actress, the most
accomplished deceiver amongst all womankind, her conduct to-night could
not be all acting, it could not be all deception. She did not love him:
she had confessed that, very plainly. She did not love him; and she had
only married him in order to serve a purpose of her own. But then, on
the other hand, if her passionate words were to be believed in, she
did not love Launcelot Darrell. There was some comfort in that. “Let me
see the will, Eleanor,” he repeated, as his wife stared at him blankly,
in the first shock of her discovery.

“I can’t find it,” she said, hopelessly. “It’s gone; it’s lost. Oh,
for pity’s sake, go out into the garden and look for it. I must have
dropped it amongst the evergreens outside Mr. de Crespigny’s room. Pray
go and look for it.”

“I will,” the lawyer said, taking up his hat and walking towards the
door of the room.

But Miss Lavinia de Crespigny stopped him.

“No, Mr. Monckton,” she said; “pray don’t go out into the night air.
Parker is the proper person to look for this document.”

She rang the bell, which was answered by the old butler.

“Has Brooks come back from Windsor?” she asked.

“No, miss, not yet.”

“A paper has been dropped in the garden, Parker, somewhere amongst the
evergreens, outside my uncle’s rooms. Will you take a lantern, and go
and look for it?”

“Dear, dear!” exclaimed Miss Sarah, “Brooks has been a very long time
going from here to Windsor and back again. I wish Mr. Lawford’s clerk
were come. The place would be taken care of then, and we should have no
further anxiety.”

The lady looked suspiciously from her nephew to Eleanor, and from
Eleanor to Gilbert Monckton. She did not know whom to trust, or whom
most to fear. Launcelot Darrell sat before her, biting savagely at his
nails, and with his head bent upon his breast. Eleanor had sunk into
the chair nearest her, utterly dumbfounded by the loss of the will.

“You need not fear that we shall long intrude upon you, Miss de
Crespigny,” Gilbert Monckton said. “My wife has made an accusation
against a person in this room. It is only right, in your interest,
and for the justification of her truth and honour, that this business
should be investigated—and immediately.”

“The will _must_ be found,” Eleanor cried; “it _must_ have fallen from
my pocket in the shrubbery.”

Launcelot Darrell said nothing. He waited the issue of the search that
was being made. If the will was found he was prepared to repudiate it;
for there was no other course left to him. He hated this woman, who had
suddenly arisen before him as an enemy and denouncer, who had recalled
to him the bitter memory of his first great dishonour, and who had
detected him in the commission of his first crime. He hated Eleanor,
and was ready to sacrifice her to his own safety.

He lifted his head presently, and looked about him with a scornful
laugh.

“Is this a farce, or a conspiracy, Mrs. Monckton?” he asked. “Do you
expect to invalidate my great-uncle’s genuine will—wherever that will
may happen to be found—by the production of some document dropped by
you in the garden, and which has, very likely, never been inside this
house, much less in my uncle’s possession? You surely don’t expect any
one to believe your pretty, romantic story, of a suicide in Paris, and
a midnight scene at Woodlands? It would be an excellent paragraph for a
hard-up penny-a-liner, but, really, for any other purpose——”

“Take care, Mr. Darrell,” Gilbert Monckton said, quietly, “you will
gain nothing by insolence. If I do not resent your impertinence to
my wife, it is because I begin to believe that you are so despicable
a scoundrel as to be unworthy of an honest man’s anger. You had much
better hold your tongue.”

There was no particular eloquence in these last few words, but there
was something in the lawyer’s tone that effectually silenced Launcelot
Darrell. Mr. Monckton’s cane lay upon a chair by the fireplace,
and while speaking he had set down his hat, and taken up the cane;
unconsciously, perhaps; but the movement had not escaped the guilty
man’s furtive glance. He kept silence; and with his face darkened by a
gloomy scowl, still sat biting his nails. The will would be found. The
genuine document would be compared with the fabrication he had placed
amongst his great-uncle’s papers, and perpetual shame, punishment, and
misery would be his lot. What he suffered to-night, sitting amongst
these people, not one of whom he could count as a friend, was only a
foretaste of what he would have to suffer by-and-by in a criminal dock.

For some time there was silence in the room. The two sisters, anxious
and perplexed, looked almost despairingly at each other, fearful that
at the end of all this business they would be the sufferers; cheated,
in their helplessness, either by George Vane’s daughter or by Launcelot
Darrell. Eleanor, exhausted by her own excitement, sat with her eyes
fixed upon the door, waiting for the coming of the old butler.

More than a quarter of an hour passed in this way. Then the door
opened, and Mr. Parker made his appearance.

“You have found it!” cried Eleanor, starting to her feet.

“No, ma’am. No, Miss Lavinia,” added the butler. “I have searched every
inch of the garding, and there is nothink in the shape of a paper to be
found. The ’ousemaid was with me, and she searched likewise.”

“It _must_ be in the garden,” exclaimed Eleanor, “it must be
there—unless it has been blown away.”

“There’s not wind enough for that, ma’am. The s’rubberies are ’igh, and
it would take a deal of wind to blow a paper across the tops of the
trees.”

“And you’ve searched the ground under the trees?” asked Mr. Monckton.

“Yes, sir. We’ve searched everywhere; me and the ’ousemaid.”

Launcelot Darrell burst into a loud laugh, an insolent, strident laugh.

“Why, I thought as much,” he cried; “the whole story is a farce. I beg
your pardon, Mr. Monckton, for calling it a conspiracy. It is merely
a slight hallucination of your wife’s; and I dare say she is as much
George Vane’s daughter as I am the fabricator of a forged will.”

Mr. Darrell’s triumph had made him foolhardy. In the next moment
Gilbert Monckton’s hand was on the collar of his coat, and the cane
uplifted above his shoulders.

“Oh my goodness me!” shrieked Sarah de Crespigny, with a dismal wail,
“there’ll be murder done presently. Oh, this is too dreadful; in the
dead of the night, too.”

But before any harm could happen to Launcelot Darrell, Eleanor clung
about her husband’s upraised arm.

“What you said just now was the truth, Gilbert,” she cried; “he is not
worthy of it; he is not indeed. He is beneath an honest man’s anger.
Let him alone; for my sake let him alone. Retribution must come upon
him, sooner or later. I thought it had come to-night, but there has
been witchcraft in all this business. I _can’t_ understand it.”

“Stay, Eleanor,” said Gilbert Monckton, putting down his cane, and
turning away from Launcelot Darrell as he might have turned from a
mongrel cur that he had been dissuaded from punishing: “This last
will—what was the wording of it—to whom did it leave the fortune?”

Launcelot Darrell looked up eagerly, breathlessly waiting for Eleanor’s
answer.

“I don’t know,” she said.

“What, have you forgotten?”

“No, I never knew anything about the contents of the will. I had
no opportunity of looking at it. I took it from the chair on which
Launcelot Darrell threw it, and put it in my pocket. From that moment
to this I have never seen it.”

“How do you know, then, that it was a will?” asked Gilbert Monckton.

“Because I heard Launcelot Darrell and his companion speak of it as the
genuine will.”

The young man seemed infinitely relieved by the knowledge of Eleanor’s
ignorance.

“Come, Mr. Monckton,” he said, with an air of injured innocence, “you
have been very anxious to investigate the grounds of your wife’s
accusation, and have been very ready to believe in a most absurd
story. You have even gone so far as to wish to execute summary
vengeance upon me with a walking-stick. I think it’s my turn now to ask
a few questions.”

“You can ask as many as you please,” answered the lawyer.

His mind was bewildered by what had happened. Eleanor’s earnestness,
which had seemed so real, had all ended in nothing. How if it was all
acting; how if some darker mystery lurked beneath all this tumult of
accusation and denial? The canker of suspicion, engendered by one
woman’s treachery, had taken deep root in Gilbert Monckton’s breast.
He had lost one of the purest and highest gifts of a noble nature—the
power to trust.

“Very well, then,” said Launcelot Darrell, turning to Eleanor: “perhaps
you will tell me how I contrived to open this cabinet, out of which
you say I stole one document, and into which you declare I introduced
another?”

“You took the keys from Mr. de Crespigny’s room.”

“Indeed! But is there no one keeping watch in that room?”

“Yes,” cried Miss Sarah, “Jepcott is there. Jepcott has been there ever
since my beloved uncle expired. Nothing has been disturbed, and Jepcott
has had the care of the room. We could trust Jepcott with untold gold.”

“Yes,” said Miss Lavinia, “with untold gold.”

“But she was asleep!” cried Eleanor, “the woman was asleep when that
man went into the room.”

“Asleep!” exclaimed Miss Sarah; “oh, surely not. Surely Jepcott would
not deceive us; I can’t think that of her. The very last words I said
to her were, ‘Jepcott, do you feel at all sleepy? If you feel in the
least degree sleepy, have the housemaid to sit with you—make assurance
doubly sure, and have the housemaid!’ ‘No, Miss,’ Jepcott said, ‘I
never felt more wakeful in my life, and as to the girl, she’s a poor,
frightened silly, and I don’t think you could induce her to go into
master’s room, though you were to offer her a five-pound note for doing
it.’ And if Jepcott went to sleep after this, knowing that everything
was left about just as it was when my uncle died, it was really too bad
of her.”

“Send for Mrs. Jepcott,” said Launcelot Darrell; “let us hear what
she has to say about this very probable story of my stealing my
great-uncle’s keys.”

Miss Lavinia de Crespigny rang the bell, which was answered by Mr.
Parker, who, though usually slow to respond to any summons, was
wonderfully prompt in his attendance this evening.

“Tell Mrs. Jepcott to come here,” said Miss Lavinia; “I want to speak
to her.”

The butler departed upon this errand, and again there was a silent
pause, which seemed a very long one, but which only extended over five
minutes. At the end of that time Mrs. Jepcott appeared. She was a
respectable-looking woman, prim, and rather grim in appearance. She had
been in the dead man’s service for five-and-thirty years, and was about
fifteen years older than the Misses de Crespigny, whom she always spoke
of as “the young ladies.”

“Jepcott,” said Miss Sarah, “I want to know whether anybody whatever,
except yourself, has entered Mr. de Crespigny’s room since you have
been placed in charge of it?”

“Oh, dear no, miss,” answered the housekeeper, promptly, “certainly
not.”

“Are you sure of that, Jepcott?”

“Quite sure, miss; as sure as I am that I am standing here this moment.”

“You speak very confidently, Jepcott, but this is really a most serious
business. I am told that you have been asleep.”

“Asleep, Miss de Crespigny! Oh, dear, who _could_ say anything of the
kind? Who could be so wicked as to tell such a story?”

“You are certain that you have not been asleep?”

“Yes, miss, quite certain. I closed my eyes sometimes, for my sight is
weak, as you know, miss, and the light dazzled me, and made my eyes
ache. I close my eyes generally when I sit down of an evening, for my
sight doesn’t allow me to do needlework by candlelight, neither to read
a newspaper; and I may have closed my eyes to-night, but I didn’t go
to _sleep_, miss, oh dear no; I was too nervous and anxious for that,
a great deal; besides, I am not a good sleeper at any time, and so I
should have heard if a mouse had stirred in the room.”

“You didn’t hear me come into the room, did you, Mrs. Jepcott?” asked
Launcelot Darrell.

“_You_, Mr. Darrell? Oh, dear, no; neither you nor anybody else, sir.”

“And you don’t think that I could have come into the room without your
knowing it? You don’t think I could have come in while you were asleep?”

“But I _wasn’t_ asleep, Mr. Darrell; and as for you or anybody comin’
in without my hearin’ ’em—why I heard every leaf that stirred outside
the windows.”

“I fear that at least this part of your charge must drop to the ground,
Mrs. Monckton,” Launcelot Darrell said, scornfully.

“Jepcott,” said Miss Lavinia de Crespigny, “go back and see if my
uncle’s keys are safe.”

“Yes, do, Mrs. Jepcott,” exclaimed Launcelot Darrell; “and be sure you
take notice whether they have been disturbed since your master died.”

The housekeeper left the room, and returned after about three minutes’
absence.

“The keys are quite safe, Miss Lavinia,” she said.

“And they have not been disturbed?” asked Launcelot.

“No, Mr. Darrell, they haven’t been moved a quarter of an inch. They’re
lyin’ just where they lay when my poor master died, half hid under a
pocket-handkerchief.”

Launcelot Darrell drew a long breath. How wonderfully these foolish
women had played into his hands, and helped him to escape.

“That will do, Jepcott,” said Miss Sarah; “you may go now. Remember
that you are responsible for everything in my uncle’s room until the
arrival of Mr. Lawford’s clerk. It would have been a very bad business
for you if Mr. de Crespigny’s keys had been tampered with.”

Mrs. Jepcott looked rather alarmed at this remark, and retired without
delay. Suppose she had been asleep, after all, for five minutes or so,
and some mischief had arisen out of it, what might not her punishment
be. She had a very vague idea of the power of the law, and did not know
what penalties she might have incurred by five minutes’ unconscious
doze. This honest woman had been in the habit of spending the evening
in a series of intermittent naps for the last ten years, and had no
idea that while closing her eyes to shade them from the glare of the
light, she often slumbered soundly for an hour at a stretch.

“Well, Mrs. Monckton,” Launcelot Darrell said, when the housekeeper had
left the room, “I suppose now you are convinced that all this midwinter
night’s dream is a mere hallucination of your own?”

Eleanor looked at him with a contemptuous smile, whose open scorn was
not the least painful torture he had been obliged to bear that night.

“Do not speak to me,” she said; “remember who I am; and let that memory
keep you silent.”

The door-bell rang loudly as Eleanor finished speaking.

“Thank Heaven!” exclaimed Miss de Crespigny, “Mr. Lawford’s clerk has
come at last. He will take charge of everything, and _if_ anybody has
tampered with my uncle’s papers,” she added, looking first at Launcelot
and then at Eleanor, “I have no doubt that he will find out all about
it. We are poor unprotected women, but I dare say we shall find those
who will be able to defend our rights.”

“I don’t think we have any occasion to stop here,” said Mr. Monckton;
“are you ready to come home, Eleanor?”

“Quite ready,” his wife answered.

“You have nothing more to say?”

“Nothing.”

“Put on your cloak, then, and come. Good night, Miss de Crespigny. Good
night, Miss Lavinia.”

Mr. Lawford’s clerk came in while Gilbert Monckton and his wife
were leaving the room. He was the same old man whom Richard Thornton
had seen at Windsor. Eleanor perceived that this man was surprised
to see Launcelot Darrell. He started, and looked at the artist with
a half-frightened, half-inquiring glance; but the young man did not
return the look.




CHAPTER XLVI.

LAURA’S TROUBLES.


Gilbert Monckton offered Eleanor his arm as they went out of the hall
and down the steps before the front entrance.

“I would have got a conveyance for you if it had been possible,
Eleanor,” he said; “but of course at this time of night that is utterly
out of the question. Do you think that you can manage the walk home?”

“Oh, yes; very well indeed.”

She sighed as she spoke. She felt completely baffled by what had
occurred; terribly prostrated by the defeat which had befallen her.
There was no hope, then. This base and treacherous man was always to
triumph, however wicked, however criminal.

“Is it very late?” she asked, presently.

“Yes, very late—past one o’clock.”

The husband and wife walked homewards in silence. The road seemed even
drearier than before to Eleanor, though this time she had a companion
in her dismal journey. But this time despair was gnawing at her breast;
she had been supported before by excitement, buoyed up by hope.

They reached Tolldale at last. The butler admitted them. He had
sent all the other servants to bed, and had sat up alone to receive
his master. Even upon this night of bewilderment Gilbert Monckton
endeavoured to keep up appearances.

“We have been to Woodlands,” he said to the old servant. “Mr. de
Crespigny is dead.”

He had no doubt that his own and his wife’s absence had given rise to
wonderment in the quiet household; and he thought by this means to set
all curiosity at rest. But the drawing-room door opened while he was
speaking, and Laura rushed into the hall.

“Oh, my goodness gracious,” she exclaimed, “here you are at last. What
I have suffered this evening! Oh I what agonies I have suffered this
evening, wondering what had happened, and thinking of all sorts of
horrid things.”

“But, my dear Laura, why didn’t you go to bed?” asked Mr. Monckton.

“_Go to bed!_” screamed the young lady. “Go to bed, with my poor brain
bursting with suspense. I’m sure if people’s brains _do_ burst, it’s
a wonder mine hasn’t to-night, and I thought ever so many times it
was going to do it. First Eleanor goes out without leaving word where
_she’s_ gone; and then you go out without leaving word where _you’re_
gone; and then you both stay away for hours, and hours, and hours. And
there I sit all the time watching the clock, with nobody but the Skye
to keep me company: until I get so nervous that I daren’t look behind
me, and I almost begin to feel as if the Skye was a demon dog! And, oh,
do tell me what in goodness’ name has happened.”

“Come into the drawing-room, Laura; and pray don’t talk so fast. I’ll
tell you presently.”

Mr. Monckton walked into the drawing-room, followed by Laura and his
wife. He closed the door, and then sat down by the fire.

“I’ve had coals put on five times,” exclaimed Miss Mason; “but all the
coals in the world wouldn’t keep me from shivering and feeling as if
somebody was coming in through the door and looking over my shoulder.
If it hadn’t been for the Skye I should have gone mad. What _has_
happened?”

“Something has happened at Woodlands—” Mr. Monckton began, gravely; but
Laura interrupted him with a little shriek.

“Oh, don’t,” she cried, “don’t, please; I’d rather you didn’t. I know
what you’re going to say. You must come and sleep with me to-night,
Eleanor, if you don’t want to find me raving mad in the morning. No
wonder I felt as if the room was peopled with ghosts.”

“Don’t be foolish, Laura,” Mr. Monckton said, impatiently. “You asked
me what has happened, and I tell you. To speak plain, Mr. de Crespigny
is dead.”

“Yes, I guessed that, of course, directly you began to speak in that
solemn way. It’s very dreadful—not that he should be dead, you know;
because I scarcely ever saw him, and when I did see him he always
seemed to be deaf, or grumpy—but it seems dreadful that people should
die at all; and I always fancy they’ll come walking into the room at
night when I’m taking my hair down before the glass, and look over my
shoulder, as they do in German stories.”

“Laura!”

“Oh, please don’t look contemptuously at me,” cried Miss Mason,
piteously; “of course, if you haven’t got nerves it’s very easy to
despise these things; and I wish _I’d_ been born a man or a lawyer,
or something of that sort, so that I might never be nervous. Not that
I believe in ghosts, you know; I’m not so childish as that I don’t
believe in them, and I’m not afraid of them; _but I don’t like them_!”

Gilbert Monckton’s contemptuous expression changed to a look of pity.
This was the foolish girl whom he had been about to entrust to the man
he now knew to be a villain. He _now_ knew;—bah, he had paltered with
his own conscience. He had known it from the first. And this poor child
loved Launcelot Darrell. Her hopes, like his own, were shipwrecked;
even in the egotism of his misery the strong man felt some compassion
for this helpless girl.

“So, Mr. de Crespigny is dead,” Laura said, after a pause; “does
Launcelot know it yet?”

“He does.”

“Was he there to-night—up at Woodlands, in spite of his nasty old
aunts?”

“Yes, he was there.”

Eleanor looked anxiously, almost piteously, at Laura. The great
disappointment, the death-blow of every hope, was coming down upon her;
and Eleanor, who could see the hand uplifted to strike, and the cruel
knife bared ready to inflict the fatal stab, shivered as she thought of
the misery the thoughtless girl must have to suffer.

“But what can her misery be against my father’s,” she thought, “and how
am _I_ accountable for her sorrow? It is all Launcelot Darrell’s work;
it is his wicked work from first to last.”

“And do you think he will have the fortune?” Laura asked.

“I don’t know, my dear,” her guardian answered, gravely, “but I think
it matters very little either to you or me whether he may get the
fortune or not.”

“What, do you mean?” cried the girl, “how strangely you speak; how
cruelly and coldly you speak of Launcelot, just as if you didn’t care
whether he was rich or poor. Oh, good heavens,” she shrieked, suddenly
growing wild with terror, “why do you both look at me like that? Why do
you both look so anxious? I know that something dreadful has happened.
Something has happened to Launcelot! It’s not Mr. de Crespigny, it’s
Launcelot that’s dead!”

“No, no, Laura, he is not dead. It would be better perhaps if he were.
He is not a good man, Laura, and he can never be your husband.”

“Oh, I don’t care a bit about his not being good, as long as he isn’t
dead,” exclaimed Laura. “I never said he was good, and never wanted
him to be good. _I’m_ not good; for I don’t like going to church three
times every Sunday. The idea of your saying my poor dear Launcelot
mustn’t marry me because he isn’t good! I like him to be a little
wicked; like the Giaour, or Manfred—though goodness gracious only knows
what _he’d_ done that he should go on as he did—I never asked him to
be good. Goodness wouldn’t go well with his style of looks. It’s fair
people, with wishy-washy blue eyes and straight hair, and no eyebrows
or eyelashes in particular, that are generally good. I hate _good_
people, and if you don’t let me marry Launcelot Darrell now, I shall
marry him when I’m of age, and that’ll be in three years’ time.”

Miss Mason said all this with great vehemence and indignation, and
then walked towards the door of the room; but Eleanor stopped her, and
caught the slender little figure in her arms.

“Ah! Laura, Laura,” she cried, “you must listen to us, you must hear
us, my poor darling. I know it seems very cruel to speak against the
man you love, but it would be fifty times more cruel to let you marry
him, and leave you to discover afterwards, when your life was linked to
his, and never, never could be a happy life again if parted from him,
that he was unworthy of your love. If it is terrible to be told this
now, Laura, it would be a thousand times more terrible to hear it then.
Come with me to your room, dear; I will stay with you all to-night. I
will tell you all I know about Launcelot Darrell. I ought to have told
you before, perhaps; but I waited; I waited for what I begin to think
will never come.”

“I won’t believe anything against him,” cried Laura, passionately,
disengaging herself from Eleanor’s embrace; “I won’t listen to you. I
won’t hear a word. _I_ know why you don’t want me to marry him. You
were in love with him yourself, you know you were, and you’re jealous
of me, and you want to prevent my being happy with him.”

Of all the unlucky speeches that could have been made in the presence
of Gilbert Monckton, this was perhaps the most unlucky. He started as
if he had been stung, and rising from his seat near the fire, took a
lighted candle from a side table, and walked to the door.

“I really can’t endure all this,” he said. “Eleanor, I’ll leave you
with Laura. Say what you have to say about Launcelot Darrell, and for
pity’s sake let me never hear his name again. Good night.”

The two girls were left alone together. Laura had thrown herself upon
a sofa, and was sobbing violently. Eleanor stood a few paces from her,
looking at her with the same tender and compassionate expression with
which she had regarded her from the first.

“When I see your troubles, Laura,” she said, “I almost forget my own.
My poor dear child, God knows how truly I pity you.”

“But I don’t want your pity,” cried Laura. “I shall hate you if you say
anything against Launcelot. Why should anybody pity me? I am engaged to
the man I love, the only man I ever loved—you know that, Eleanor; you
know how I fell in love with him directly he came to Hazlewood,—and I
will marry him in spite of all the world. I shall be of age in three
years, And then no horrid guardians can prevent my doing what I like!”

“But you would not marry him, Laura, if you knew him to be a bad man?”

“I would never believe that he is a bad man!”

“But, my darling, you will listen to me. I must tell you the truth. I
have kept it from you too long. I have been very guilty in keeping it
from you. I ought to have told you when I first came back to Tolldale.”

“_What_ ought you to have told me?”

“The story of my life, Laura. But I thought you would come between me
and the victory I wanted to achieve.”

“What victory?”

“A victory over the man who caused my father’s death.”

Then, little by little, interrupted by a hundred exclamations and
protestations from the sobbing girl whose head lay on her shoulder, and
whose waist was encircled by her arm, Eleanor Monckton told the story
of her return to Paris, the meeting on the Boulevard, and George Vane’s
suicide. Little by little she contrived to explain to the wretched girl
who clung about her, and who declared again and again that she _would_
not believe anything against Launcelot, that she could not think him
cruel or treacherous,—how the artist and his vile associate, Victor
Bourdon, had cheated the old man out of the money which represented his
own honour and the future welfare of his child.

“You think me hard and merciless, Laura,” she cried, “and I sometimes
wonder at my own feelings; but remember, only remember what my father
suffered. He was cheated out of the money that had been entrusted
to him. He was afraid to face his own child. Oh, my poor dear, how
could you wrong me so cruelly,” she murmured, in a low voice, as if
addressing her dead father, “how could you think that I should have
spoken one word of reproach, or loved you any the less, if you had lost
a dozen fortunes of mine? No, Laura, I _cannot_ forget what my father
suffered; I _cannot_ be merciful to this man.”

Eleanor’s task was a very hard one. Laura would not believe; that is to
say, she would not acknowledge that she believed; but she had none of
the calm assurance which a perfect and entire faith in her lover should
have given her. It was useless to reason with her. All Eleanor’s logic
was powerless against the passionate force of this girl’s perpetual
cry, the gist of which was, “I will believe no harm of him! I love him,
and I will not cease to love him!”

She would not argue, or listen to Eleanor’s calm reasoning; for Mrs.
Monckton was very calm in the knowledge of her own defeat, almost
despairingly resigned, in the idea that all struggle against Launcelot
Darrell was hopeless. Laura would not listen, would not be convinced.
The man whom Eleanor had seen in Paris was not Launcelot. He was in
India at that very time. He had written letters from India, and posted
them thence, with foreign postage stamps. The shipbroker’s books were
all wrong; what was more likely than that stupid shipbrokers’ clerks
should make wrong entries in their horrid books? In short, according to
poor Laura’s reasoning, Launcelot Darrell was the victim of a series
of coincidences. There had happened to be a person who resembled him
in Paris at the time of George Vane’s death. There happened to be a
mistake in the shipbroker’s books. The figure in the water-coloured
sketch that Eleanor had stolen happened to be like the old man. Miss
Mason rejected circumstantial evidence in toto. As for the story of
the forgery, she declared that it was all a fabrication of Eleanor’s,
invented in order that the marriage should be postponed.

“You’re very cruel, Eleanor,” she cried, “and you’ve acted very
treacherously, and I shouldn’t have thought it of you. First you fall
in love with Launcelot Darrell; and then you go and marry my guardian;
and then, when you find that you don’t like my guardian, you begrudge
me my happiness; and you now want to set me against Launcelot; but I
will not be set against him. THERE!”

This last decisive monosyllable was uttered amidst a torrent of sobs,
and then, for a long time, the two girls sat in silence upon the sofa
before the expiring fire. By-and-by, Laura nestled her head a little
closer upon Eleanor’s shoulder: then a little hand, very cold, by
reason of its owner’s agitation, stole into the open palm lying idle
upon Mrs. Monckton’s lap; and at last, in a low voice, almost stifled
by tears, she murmured:

“_Do_ you think that he is wicked? Oh! Eleanor, do you _really_ think
that it was he who cheated your poor old father?”

“I know that it was he, Laura.”

“And do you believe that he has made a false will, for the sake of that
dreadful money? Oh, how could he care for the money, when we might
have been so happy together poor! Do you _really_ believe that he has
committed—forgery?”

She dropped her voice to a whisper as she spoke the word that was so
awful to her when uttered in relation to Launcelot Darrell.

“I believe it, and I know it, Laura,” Eleanor answered, gravely.

“But what will they do to him? What will become of him? They won’t hang
him—will they, Eleanor? They don’t hang people for forgery now. Oh,
Eleanor, what will become of him? I love him so dearly, I don’t care
what he is, or what he has done. I love him still, and would die to
save him.”

“You need not be afraid, Laura,” Mrs. Monckton answered, bitterly.
“Launcelot Darrell will escape all evil consequences of what he has
done. You may be sure of that. He will hold his head higher than he
ever held it yet, Laura. He will be master of Woodlands before next
week is over.”

“But his conscience, Eleanor, his conscience! He will be so unhappy—he
will be so miserable.”

Laura disengaged herself from the loving arm that had supported her,
and started to her feet.

“Eleanor!” she cried, “where is he? Let me go to him! It is not too
late to undo all this, perhaps. He can put back the real will, can’t
he?”

“No, the real will is lost.”

“He can destroy the false one, then.”

“I don’t think he will have the chance of doing that, Laura. If his
heart is not hardened against remorse, he will have plenty of time
for repentance between this and the time when the will is read. If he
wishes to undo what he has done, he may make a confession to his aunts,
and throw himself upon their mercy. They are the only persons likely
to be injured by what he has done. The money was left to them in the
original will, no doubt.”

“He _shall_ confess, Eleanor!” cried Laura. “I will throw myself upon
my knees at his feet, and I won’t leave him till he promises me to undo
what he has done. His aunts will keep the secret, for their own sakes.
They wouldn’t like the world to know that their nephew could do such a
wicked thing. He shall confess to them, and let them have the fortune,
and then we can be married, and then we shall be as happy together as
if he had never done wrong. Let me go to him.”

“Not to-night, Laura. Look at the clock.”

Eleanor pointed to the dial of the timepiece opposite them. It was
half-past two o’clock.

“I will see him to-morrow morning, then, Eleanor. I _will_ see him.”

“You shall, my dear; if you think it wise or right to do so.”

But Laura Mason did not see her lover the next morning; for when the
morning came she was in a burning fever, brought on by the agitation
and excitement of the previous night. A medical man was summoned from
Windsor to attend upon her; and Eleanor sat by her bedside, watching
her as tenderly as a mother watches her sick child.

Gilbert Monckton, too, was very anxious about his ward, and came to the
door of Laura’s room to make inquiries many times in the course of that
day.




CHAPTER XLVII.

GETTING OVER IT.


Laura Mason was not dangerously ill. Her malady was by no means of a
serious nature. The pink-blossom tint of her cheeks was intensified
into vivid carnation; the turquoise-blue eyes shone with a feverish
light; the little hands were very hot and dry. It was in vain that the
physician from Windsor prescribed composing draughts. His patient would
not be quiet or composed. In vain Eleanor tried to soothe the wounded
spirit. It would not be at rest.

“It’s no use, Nelly,” the invalid cried, impatiently. “I _must_ talk of
him; I must talk of my sorrows, unless you want me to go mad. Oh, my
poor Launcelot! my own dear Launcelot! how cruel it is to keep me from
you!”

This was the worst part of the business. Poor Laura was perpetually
entreating to be allowed to see Launcelot. Would they let her go to
him; or would they send and ask him to come to her? They were the most
cruel and heartless creatures, if they could refuse to let her see him.

But Eleanor did refuse.

“It is impossible, my darling,” she said; “I cannot send for him. It
is quite impossible that he and I should ever meet again, except as
enemies. The will must be read in a few days. Let us wait till then. If
Launcelot Darrell is sorry for what he has done, he will try to undo
it. If he is not sorry, and takes possession of the estate upon the
strength of a forged will, he must be a villain, unworthy even of your
pity, Laura.”

“But I _do_ pity him; and I love him.”

It was strange to see what a hold this unhappy affection had taken upon
Laura’s shallow nature. This frivolous girl was as impressionable as
she was volatile. The blow was more terrible to her than it would have
been to a woman of higher and grander nature; but to such a woman the
consequences of the blow would be, perhaps, life-long, while it was
scarcely likely that Laura would suffer for ever. She did not try to
endure the grief that had fallen upon her. She was entirely without
pride; and had no more shame in bemoaning her loss of Launcelot Darrell
than she would have had fifteen years before in crying over a broken
doll. She did not care who knew her sorrows, and would have made a
confidante of the servant who waited upon her if Eleanor had not
interfered to prevent her.

“I’m very miserable and wretched, Jane,” she said, while the girl was
smoothing her pillows and arranging the tumbled bed-clothes, which had
been twisted into mere wisps of linen by the perpetual tossings to and
fro of the invalid. “I’m the most miserable creature that ever was
born, Jane, and I wish that I was dead. I know it’s wicked, but I do.
What’s the good of Dr. Featherstone prescribing for me, when I don’t
want to be prescribed for? What’s the good of my taking lime-draughts,
when I’d much rather die? What’s the use of those horrid opiates, that
taste like stale London porter? Opiates won’t give me back Launce——”

She stopped abruptly at this point, checked by a warning look from
Eleanor.

“You must not speak of Launcelot Darrell to these people, Laura,” Mrs.
Monckton said, when the servant had left the room, “unless you want
them to suspect that something strange has happened.”

“But they’ll know it, if my wedding is put off.”

“Your guardian will explain all that, Laura.”

Miss Mason bemoaned her fate even more piteously than before. “It’s
hard enough to be miserable,” she cried, “but it’s still worse to be
miserable, and not to be allowed to say so.”

“Many people have sorrows to endure that cannot be spoken of,” Eleanor
answered, quietly. “I had to bear the sorrow of my father’s death when
I dared not speak of it.”

Mrs. Monckton saw very little of her husband during the few days of
Laura’s illness. She only saw him, indeed, when he came to the door
to make inquiries about his ward; but even in the few brief sentences
exchanged by them, she could perceive that his manner was altered
towards her. He had been cold and distant for a long time since their
marriage; but now his manner had the icy reserve of a man who feels
that he has been wronged. Eleanor comprehended this, and was sorry for
it; but she had a dull, hopeless feeling that nothing she could do
would alter it. The great purpose of her life had failed; and she began
to think that nothing but failure could come to any hope of hers.

This feeling separated her completely from her husband. In her
ignorance of the suspicions which tortured him, she could of course
make no effort to set him right. The girl’s innocence and the man’s
pride made a gulf that no power of affection could pass. If Eleanor
could have guessed, ever so vaguely, at the cause of her husband’s
reserve, a few words from her might have melted the ice: but she had
not the faintest notion of the hidden source from which came those
bitter waters that had swept away all outward tokens of her husband’s
love; and those words remained unspoken. Gilbert Monckton thought that
if his wife was not false, she was at least indifferent; and he bowed
his head before the gloomy face of his Destiny.

“I am not to be loved,” he said. “Good-bye once more to that dream.
And let me try to do my duty, and be in some way useful to my
fellow-creatures. Half my life has been swallowed up by egotistical
regrets. May God give me grace to use the remnant of it more wisely.”

He had told Eleanor that as soon as Laura was a little better he should
take her to the sea-side.

“The poor child cannot remain here,” he said; “every gossip in the
neighbourhood will be eager to know why the wedding is postponed;
and unless we assign some simple reason for the change in our
arrangements, there will be no limit to people’s speculations and
conjectures. Laura’s illness will be the best possible excuse; and I
will take her to the south of France. She may forget Launcelot Darrell
by-and-by, when she finds herself in a strange place, surrounded by new
associations.”

Eleanor eagerly assented to this.

“Nothing could be wiser than such an arrangement,” she answered. “I
almost think the poor girl would die if she remained here. Everything
reminds her of her disappointment.”

“Very well, then, I shall take her to Nice as soon as she is well
enough to go. Will you tell her that I mean to do so, and try and make
her feel some interest in the idea of the change?”

Eleanor Monckton had a very hard time of it in the sick room. Those
frivolous people who feel their misfortunes very acutely for the
time being, are apt to throw a heavy share of their burden upon the
shoulders of their friends. Laura’s lamentations were very painful and
not a little monotonous to hear; and there was a great deal of hard
work to be done in the way of going over the same ground again and
again, for that young lady’s consolation. She had no idea of turning
her face to the wall and suffering in silence. Her manner had none of
that artificial calm which often causes uneasiness to those who watch
a beloved sufferer through some terrible crisis. Everything reminded
her of her grief; and she would not be courageous enough to put away
the things that recalled her sorrows. She could not draw a curtain over
the bright picture of the past, and turn her face resolutely to the
blank future. She was forever looking back, and bewailing the beauty
of that vanished hope, and insisting that the dream palace was not
utterly ruined; that it might be patched up again somehow or another;
not to be what it was before; that was impossible, of course; but to be
_something_. The broken vase could surely be pieced together, and the
scent of the faded roses would hang round it still.

“If he repents, I will marry him, Eleanor,” she said, at the end of
almost every argument, “and we will go to Italy and be happy together,
and he will be a great painter. Nobody would dare to say he had
committed a forgery if he was a great painter like Holman Hunt, or Mr.
Millais. We’ll go to Rome together, Nelly, and he shall study the old
masters, and sketch peasants from the life; and I won’t mind even if
they’re pretty; though it isn’t pleasant to have one’s husband always
sketching pretty peasants; and that will divert his mind, you know.”

For four days Laura was ordered to keep to her bed, and during that
time Eleanor rarely quitted the invalid’s apartments, only taking
brief snatches of rest in an easy-chair by the fire in Laura’s
dressing-room. On the fifth day Miss Mason was allowed to get up, and
then there were terrible scenes to be gone through; for the young lady
insisted upon having her trousseau spread out upon the bed, and the
chair, and the sofas, and hung upon every available peg in the two
rooms; until both those apartments became a very forest of finery,
about which the invalid prowled perpetually, indulging in a separate
fit of weeping over each garment.

“Look at this darling parasol, Nelly,” she cried, gazing at the tiny
canopy of silk and whalebone with streaming eyes; “isn’t the real point
lace over the pale pink silk lovely? And then it’s so becoming to the
complexion, too! Oh, how happy I thought I should be when I had this
parasol. I thought I should drive on the Corso with Launcelot, and
_now_——! And the violet satin boots with high heels, Nelly, made on
purpose to wear with my violet silk dress; I thought nobody _could_ be
unhappy with such things as those, and _now_!”

Every speech ended in fresh tears, which sometimes trickled over a
shining silken garment, and flecked the lustrous fabric with spots of
water that took the brightness out of the splendid hues.

“To think that I should be so miserable as to cry over silk at nine and
sixpence a yard, and not to care!” exclaimed Laura Mason; as if, in
these words, she described the highest anguish-point that human misery
can reach.

She had a few presents given her by Launcelot; they were _very_ few,
and by no means valuable; for Mr. Darrell, as we know was essentially
selfish, and did not care to spend his small stock of money upon other
people; and she sat with these trifles in her lap for hours together,
lamenting over them, and talking about them.

“There’s my silver thimble—my dear, darling little silver thimble,”
she said, perching the scrap of glistening metal upon her little
finger, and kissing it with that degree of rapture which the French
vaudevilleists call “explosion!”—“that nasty, spiteful Amelia Shalders
said a silver thimble was a vulgar present, just what a carpenter, or
any other common man, would have given to his sweetheart, and that
Launcelot ought to have given me a ring or a bracelet; as if he could
go buying rings and bracelets without any money. And I don’t care
whether my thimble’s vulgar or not, and I love it dearly, because he
gave it me. And I’d do lots of needlework for the sake of using it,
only I never could learn to use a thimble—quite. It always seems so
much easier to work without one, though it does make a hole in the top
of one’s finger. Then there’s my tablets! Nobody can say that ivory
tablets are vulgar. My darling little tablets, with the tiny, _tiny_
gold pencil-case,”—the gold pencil-case was _very_ tiny—“and the wee
mite of a turquoise for a seal. I’ve tried to write ‘Launcelot’ upon
every leaf, but I don’t think ivory tablets are the very nicest things
to write upon. One’s writing seems to slide about somehow, as if the
pencil was tipsy, and the lines won’t come straight. It’s like trying
to walk up and down the deck of a steamer; one goes where one doesn’t
want to go.”

The bewailings over the trousseau and the presents had a beneficial
effect upon the heart-broken invalid. On the evening of the fifth day
her spirits began to revive a little; she drank tea with Eleanor at
a table by the fire in the dressing-room, and after tea tried on her
wedding bonnet and mantle before the cheval glass.

This performance seemed to have a peculiarly consoling effect; and
after surveying herself for a long time in the glass, and lamenting the
redness of her eyelids, which prevented full justice being done to the
beauty of the bonnet, Miss Mason declared that she felt a great deal
better, and that she had a presentiment that something would happen,
and that everything would come right somehow or other.

As it would have been very cruel to deprive her of this rather vague
species of comfort, Eleanor said nothing, and the evening ended almost
cheerfully. But the next day was that appointed for Mr. de Crespigny’s
funeral and the reading of the will; and Laura’s anxiety was now
really greater than it had ever been. She could not help believing
Eleanor’s story of the forgery, though she had struggled long against
the conviction that had been forced upon her; and her only hope was
that her lover would repent, and suffer his aunts to inherit the wealth
which had been no doubt bequeathed to them. Frivolous and shallow
as this girl was, she could not for a moment contemplate marrying
Launcelot under any other circumstances. She could not think of sharing
with him a fortune that had been gained by fraud.

“I know he will confess the truth,” she said to Eleanor, upon the
morning of the funeral; “he was led into doing wrong by his friend that
wicked Frenchman. It was only the impulse of the moment. He has been
sorry ever since, I dare say. He will undo what he has done.”

“But if the real will has been destroyed?”

“Then his two aunts and his mother would share the estate between them.
My guardian told me so the other day when I asked him some question
about the fortune. And he told Launcelot the same thing that night in
the library, when they had the conversation about my fortune.”

If Laura was anxious upon this eventful day, Eleanor was anxious too.
It was a new crisis in her life. Would Launcelot Darrell attempt to
restore himself to the position he had occupied before the night of
his uncle’s death, or would he hold to that which he might acquire by
his deliberate fraud, and remain a hardened and impenitent criminal,
defiant of the law he had outraged?




CHAPTER XLVIII.

THE READING OF THE WILL.


Gilbert Monckton went up to Woodlands immediately after the funeral, in
order to be present at the reading of the will. He felt that he had a
right to see the end of this business, in which his wife had played so
extraordinary a part. The will was to be read by Henry Lawford’s clerk,
in the sitting-room, or study, which Maurice de Crespigny had occupied
for many years before his death.

There were a great many people who, like Gilbert Monckton, thought they
had a right to be present upon this occasion; people who had been kept
out of the old man’s house by the rigid watchfulness and the inflexible
will of the two maiden ladies for the last twenty years or so, but who
were freely admitted now, as no longer capable of doing mischief. All
manner of distant relationships, so remote as to be almost untraceable,
came to light upon this occasion: cousins by marriage; sisters-in-law
of dead first cousins, once removed; widowers who attached themselves
to the house of Crespigny by right of departed wives; widows who
declared themselves near relations on the strength of claims held by
defunct husbands; poor connections who came on foot, and who were so
poor that it was really an impertinence in them to expect the smallest
legacy; rich connections who came in splendid carriages, and who seemed
even more eager for any stray twenty pounds for a mourning ring that
might be set against their names, than the poorest of the brotherhood.
And indeed these owners of splendid carriages might have been needier
than the dusty and weather-beaten pedestrians; for when people try
to make fifteen hundred a-year do the work of three thousand, every
accidental twenty pounds is a God-send to them.

However it might be, everybody in the Woodlands drawing-room upon that
particular morning was influenced by the same feeling, a compound
sensation of hope and distrust, expectancy and despair. Surely there
could never before have been so many eager faces assembled together
in the same small space. Every face, young or old, handsome or ugly,
aristocratic or plebeian, wore the same expression; and had thus a
common likeness, which bore out the idea of some tie of relationship
binding the whole assembly.

Every one regarded his or her neighbour as the possible inheritor
of something worth having, and therefore a personal enemy. Smiling
relations were suspected of being acquainted with the contents of the
will, and secretly rejoicing in the certainty of their own names being
pleasantly mentioned therein. Frowning relations were looked at darkly
as probable arch-plotters who had worked upon the mind of the dead
man. Diffident relations were feared as toadies and sycophants, who
had no doubt plied Mr. de Crespigny with artful flatteries. Confident
relations were dreaded as people who perhaps had some secret claim upon
the estate, and were silently gloating over the excellence of their
chances. Every one of these outsiders hated each other with vengeful
and murderous hate; but they all sympathized in a far deeper hatred
of the four favourites for these great legacy stakes, the two maiden
ladies, Mrs. Darrell, and her son. It was almost certain that one or
other of these four people would inherit the Woodlands property, and
the bulk of the dead man’s fortune; unless, indeed, by one of those
caprices common to eccentric valetudinarians, he should have left his
wealth to some distant connexion, who had been too proud to toady
him—and had, moreover, never had the chance of doing so. Yes, the
three nieces and Launcelot were the first favourites in this eager
race; and the outsiders speculated freely amongst themselves as to the
chances and the “condition” of these four fortunate creatures. And if
the outsiders hated each other desperately for the sake of very small
chances, how much more desperate must have been the feelings of these
four who were to enter for the great stake.

Launcelot Darrell met Mr. Monckton this morning for the first time
since that strange scene upon the night of Maurice de Crespigny’s
death. The young man had called at Tolldale Priory during the interval,
but both the lawyer and his ward had been denied to him.

Perhaps amongst all those assembled in the chamber which had so lately
been tenanted by the dead man, there was not one more painfully anxious
than Gilbert Monckton, into whose mind no mercenary thought had ever
entered.

It was in the hope of seeing his wife justified that Mr. Monckton
had come to Woodlands upon this day. He had brooded over Eleanor’s
denunciation of Launcelot Darrell perpetually during the week that had
elapsed since the old man’s death; but the more he pondered upon that
passionate accusation the more bewildered and perplexed he became.

Let it be remembered that he was a man whose nature had been rendered
jealous and suspicions by one cruel deception which had embittered
his youth and soured a generous disposition. His mind was penetrated
with the idea that Eleanor had never loved him, and that she _had_
loved Launcelot Darrell. This belief was the tormenting spirit, the
insidious demon which had held possession of his breast ever since his
brief honeymoon on the northern coast. He could not dismiss it all in
a moment. The fiend was in possession, and was not very easily to be
exorcised. That vehement denunciation, that passionate accusation which
had rushed, impetuous and angry, from Eleanor Monckton’s lips, might
be the outburst of a jealous woman’s fury, and might have its root
in love. Eleanor had loved this young man, and was indignant against
him for his intended marriage with Laura. If the desire to avenge
her father’s death had alone actuated her, surely this passionate
girl would have spoken before now. It was thus that Gilbert Monckton
argued. He did not know how eager Eleanor had been to speak, and how
she had only been held back by the worldly wisdom of Richard Thornton.
How should he know the long trial of patience, the bitter struggle
between the promptings of passion and the cold arguments of policy
which his wife had endured? He knew nothing except that something—some
secret—some master passion—had absorbed her soul, and separated her
from him.

He stood aloof in the dead man’s study while Mr. Lamb, the clerk, a
grey-haired old man, with a nervous manner and downcast eyes, arranged
his papers upon a little table near the fire, and cleared his throat
preparatory to commencing the reading of the will.

There was an awful silence in the room, as if everybody’s natural
respiration had been suspended all in a moment, and then the clerk’s
low voice began very slowly and hesitatingly with the usual formula.

“I, Maurice de Crespigny, being at this time,” &c., &c. The will
was of some length, and as it began with a great many insignificant
legacies—mourning rings, snuff-boxes, books, antique plate, scraps of
valuable china, and small donations of all kinds to distant relations
and friends who had been lost sight of on the lonely pathway along
which the old man had crawled to his tomb under the grim guardianship
of his two warders—the patience of the chief expectants was very sorely
tried. But at last, after modest little annuities to the servants had
been mentioned, the important clauses were arrived at.

To every one of the three sisters, Sarah and Lavinia de Crespigny
and Ellen Darrell, the testator bequeathed money in the funds to the
amount of two hundred a year. All the “rest and residue” of his estate,
real and personal, was left to Launcelot Darrell absolutely, without
condition or reserve.

The blood rushed up to the widow’s face, and then as suddenly receded,
leaving it ghastly white. She held out her hand to her son, who stood
beside her chair, and clasped his clammy fingers in her own.

“Thank God,” she said, in a low voice, “you have got your chance at
last, Launcelot. I should be content to die to-morrow.”

The two sisters, pale and venomous, glared at their nephew. But they
could only look at him. They could do nothing against him. He had won
and they had lost; that was all. They felt strange buzzing noises in
their ears, and the carpeted floor of the room seemed reeling up and
down like the deck of a storm-tossed vessel. This was all that they
felt just at present. The shock was so great that its first effect was
only to produce a kind of physical numbness which extended even to the
brain.

I don’t suppose that either of these elderly ladies, each of whom wore
stuff shoes and crisp little curls of unnaturally brown hair upon her
forehead, could, by any possibility, have spent upon her own wants more
than a hundred pounds a year, nor had either of them been accustomed to
indulge in the sweet luxury of charity; they were neither generous nor
ambitious. They were entirely without the capacity of spending money
either upon themselves or on other people, and yet they had striven as
eagerly for the possession of this fortune as ever any proud, ambitious
spirit strove for the golden means by which he hoped to work his way
upon the road that leads to glory.

They were fond of money; they were fond of money _per se_; without
reference to its uses, either noble or ignoble. They would have been
very happy in the possession of their dead kinsman’s fortune, though
they might have gone down to their graves without having spent so much
as the two hundred a year which they received by this cruel will.
They would have hoarded the government securities in an iron safe;
they would have added interest to principal; they would have nursed
the lands, and raised the rents, and been hard and griping with the
tenants, and would have counted their gains and calculated together the
increase of their wealth; but they would have employed the same cobbler
who had worked for them before their uncle’s death; they would still
have given out their stuff shoes to be mended; and they would have
been as sharp as ever as to an odd sixpence in their dealings with the
barber who dressed their crisp brown curls.

Launcelot Darrell kept his place beside his mother’s chair, though the
reading of the will was finished, and the clerk was folding the sheets
upon which it was written. Never had any living creature shown less
elation than this young man did upon his accession to such a very large
fortune.

Mr. Monckton went up to the little table at which the lawyer’s clerk
sat, folding up the papers.

“Will you let me look at that will for a moment, Mr. Lamb?” he asked.

The clerk looked up at him with an expression of surprise.

“You wish to look at it?——” he said, hesitating a little.

“Yes. There is no objection to my doing so, is there? It will be sent
to Doctors’ Commons, I suppose, where anybody will be able to look at
it for a shilling.”

The clerk handed Gilbert Monckton the document with a feeble little
laugh.

“There it is, Mr. Monckton,” he said. “You remember your own signature,
I dare say; you’ll find it there along with mine.”

Yes, there was the signature. It is not a very easy thing for the
cleverest man, who is not a professional expert, to decide upon the
authenticity of his own autograph. There it was. Gilbert Monckton
looked at the familiar signature, and tried in vain to find some flaw
in it. If it was a forgery, it was a very skilful one. The lawyer
remembered the date of the will which he had witnessed, and the kind of
paper upon which it had been written. The date and the paper of this
corresponded with that recollection.

The body of the will was in the handwriting of the clerk himself. It
was written upon three sheets of foolscap paper, and the signatures
of the testator and the two witnesses were repeated at the bottom of
every page. Every one of the three autographs differed from the others
in some trifling point, and this circumstance, small in itself, had
considerable influence upon Gilbert Monckton.

“If this will had been a forgery, prepared by Launcelot Darrell, the
signatures would have been fac-similes of each other,” thought the
lawyer; “that is a mistake which forgers almost always fall into. They
forget that a man very rarely signs his name twice alike. They get hold
of one autograph and stereotype it.”

What was he to think, then? If this will was genuine, Eleanor’s
accusation must be a falsehood. Could he believe this? Could he believe
that his wife was a jealous and vindictive woman, capable of inventing
a lie in order to avenge herself upon the infidelity of the man she had
loved? To believe this would be most everlasting misery. Yet how could
Gilbert Monckton think otherwise, _if_ the will was genuine? Everything
hinged upon that, and every proof was wanting against Launcelot
Darrell. The housekeeper, Mrs. Jepcott, declared most distinctly that
nobody had entered the dead man’s room or touched the keys upon the
table by the bed. This alone, if the woman’s word was to be depended
upon, gave the lie to Eleanor’s story.

But this was not all. The will was in every particular the very
opposite of such a will as would be likely to be the work of a forger.

It contained legacies to old friends of the dead man whom he had
not himself seen for twenty years, and whose very names must have
been unknown to Launcelot Darrell. It was the will of a man whose
mind lived almost entirely in the past. There was a gold snuff-box
bequeathed “to my friend Peter Sedgewick, who was stroke in the
Magdalen boat at Henley-on-the-Thames, fifty-seven years ago, when I
was six in the same boat;” there was an onyx shirt-pin left “to my old
boon companion Henry Laurence, who dined with me at the Beefsteak Club
with George Vane and Richard Brinsley Sheridan on my birthday.” The
will was full of personal recollections dated fifty years back; and how
was it possible that Launcelot Darrell could have fabricated such a
will; when by Eleanor’s own admission he had no access to the genuine
document until he came to substitute the forgery after his uncle’s
death? The forgery must therefore, Gilbert Monckton argued, have been
prepared while the young man was in utter ignorance as to the tenor of
the actual will, according to Eleanor’s story; and this, the lawyer
reasoned, was proof conclusive against his wife.

Launcelot could not have fabricated such a will as this. This will,
therefore, was genuine, and Eleanor’s accusation had been only
prompted by a sudden burst of jealous rage, which had made her almost
indifferent to consequences. Mr. Monckton examined the signatures again
and again, and then, looking very sharply at the clerk, said, in a low
voices—

“The body of this will is in your handwriting, I believe, Mr. Lamb?”

“It is, sir.”

“Can you swear that this is the genuine document; the same will which
you wrote and witnessed?”

“Most decidedly,” the clerk answered, with a look of astonishment.

“You have no suspicion whatever as to its authenticity?”

“No, sir, none! Have _you_ any suspicion, Mr. Monckton?” he added,
after a moment’s pause.

The lawyer sighed heavily.

“No,” he said, giving the paper back to the clerk; “I believe the will
is genuine.”

Just at this moment there was a stir in the assembly, and Gilbert
Monckton turned round to see what was taking place.

It was Mrs. Jepcott, the housekeeper, who was saying something to which
everybody listened intently.

The reason of this attention which the housekeeper’s smallest word
received from every member of that assembly, was the fact that she held
a paper in her hand. Every eye was fixed upon this paper. It might be
a codicil revoking the will, and making an entirely new disposition of
the property.

Faint streaks of red began to light up the wan cheeks of the two old
maids, and Launcelot Darrell grew more livid than death. But it was
not a codicil; it was only a letter written by Maurice de Crespigny,
and addressed to his three nieces.

“The night before my poor dear master died,” the housekeeper said, “I
was sitting up with him all alone, and he called me to him, and he told
me to fetch him his dressing-gown, which he’d been wearing all through
his illness, whenever he sat up; and I fetched it; and he took a sealed
letter out of the breast-pocket, and he said to me, ‘Jepcott, when my
will is read, I expect my three nieces will be very much disappointed
and will think I have not treated them fairly; so I’ve written them a
letter, begging them not to be angry with me after I’m dead and gone:
and I want you to keep it, and take care of it, until the will has
been read, and then give it to my eldest niece, Sarah, to read aloud
to her two sisters in the presence of everybody.’ And this is the
letter, miss,” added Mrs. Jepcott, handing the sealed letter to Sarah
de Crespigny.

“Thank God!” thought Gilbert Monckton, “I shall know now whether
the will is genuine. If it is a fabrication, this letter must bring
detection upon the forger.”




CHAPTER XLIX.

DESERTED.


The letter written by the old man to his three nieces was read aloud
by Miss Sarah in the presence of the eager assembly. Amongst all those
anxious listeners there was no one who listened more intently than
Gilbert Monckton.

Maurice de Crespigny’s letter was not a long one.

  “MY DEAR NIECES—SARAH, LAVINIA, AND ELLEN,—

 “You will all three be perhaps much surprised at the manner in which
 I have disposed of my estate, both real and personal; but believe
 me that in acting as I have done I have been prompted by no unkind
 feeling against you; nor am I otherwise than duly grateful for the
 attention which I have received from you during my declining years.

 “I think that I have done my duty; but be that as it may, I have done
 that which it has been my fixed intention to do for the last ten
 years. I have made several wills, and destroyed one after another, but
 they have all been in the main point to the same effect; and it has
 only been an old man’s whimsical fancy that has prompted me to make
 sundry alterations in minor details. The income of two hundred a year
 which I have left to each of you will, I know, be more than enough for
 your simple wants. The three incomes, by the wording of my will, will
 descend to my nephew, Launcelot Darrell, after your deaths.

 “I have tried to remember many old friends who have perhaps long ere
 this forgotten me, or who may laugh at an old man’s foolish bequests.

 “I do not believe that I have wronged any one; and I trust that
 you will think kindly of me when I am in my grave, and never speak
 bitterly of

  “Your affectionate uncle,

  “MAURICE DE CRESPIGNY.

 “_Woodlands, February 20th._”

This was the old man’s letter. There was not one syllable of its
contents which in any way disagreed with the wording of the will.

Launcelot Darrell drew a long breath; and his mother, sitting close
to him, with her hand in his, could feel the clammy coldness of his
fingers, and hear the loud thumping of his heart against his breast.

Gilbert Monckton took up his hat and walked out of the room. He did not
want to have any explanation with the man whom he fully believed—in
spite of all Eleanor had said—to be the fortunate rival who had robbed
him of every chance of ever winning his wife’s heart.

He had only one feeling now; and that was the same feeling which had
taken possession of him twenty years before—an eager desire to run
away, to escape from his troubles and perplexities, to get free of this
horrible atmosphere of deceit and bewilderment; to cast every hope,
every dream behind; and to go out into the world once more, joyless,
unloved, hopeless; but, at any rate, not the dupe of a false woman’s
specious pretences.

He went straight back to Tolldale while the crowd at Woodlands slowly
dispersed, more or less discontented with the day’s proceedings.
He went back to the grand old mansion in which he had never known
happiness. He asked whether his wife was with Miss Mason. No, the man
told him; Mrs. Monckton was in her own room, lying down.

This was the very thing he wished. He didn’t want to see Eleanor’s
beautiful face, framed in shining bands of hazel-brown hair; that
irresistible face whose influence he dared not trust. He wanted to see
his ward alone.

Laura ran out of her dressing-room at the sound of her guardian’s
footstep.

“Well!” she cried, “is it a forgery?”

“Hush, Laura; go back into your room.”

Miss Mason obeyed, and Mr. Monckton followed her into the pretty little
apartment, which was a modern bower of shining maplewood and flowery
chintz, and flimsy lace and muslin, frivolous and airy as the young
lady herself.

“Sit down in a comfortable seat, guardian,” said Laura, offering the
lawyer a slippery chintz-covered lounging-chair, so low as to bring Mr.
Monckton’s knees inconveniently near his chin as he sat in it. “Sit
down and tell me all about it, for goodness gracious sake. _Is_ it
forged?”

“I don’t know, my dear, whether the will is genuine or not. It would be
a very difficult question to decide.”

“But oh! good gracious me,” exclaimed Miss Mason, “how can you be so
unkind as to talk about it like that, as if it didn’t matter a bit
whether the will is forged or not. If it isn’t forged, Launcelot isn’t
bad; and if he isn’t bad, of course I may marry him, and the wedding
things won’t be all wasted. I knew that something would happen to make
everything come right.”

“Laura,” cried Mr. Monckton, “you must not talk like this. Do you know
that you are no longer a child, and that you are dealing with the most
solemn business in a woman’s life? I do not know whether the will by
which Launcelot Darrell inherits the Woodlands property is genuine or
not; I certainly have reason to _think_ that it _is_ genuine, but I
will not take upon myself to speak positively. But however that may be,
I know that he is not a good man, and you shall never marry him with my
consent.”

The young lady began to cry, and murmured something to the effect that
it was cruel to use her so when she was ill, and had been taking oceans
of lime-draughts; but Mr. Monckton was inflexible.

“If you were to have a dozen illnesses such as this,” he said, “they
would not turn me from my purpose or alter my determination. When
I voluntarily took upon myself the custody of your life, Laura, I
undertook that charge with the intention of accomplishing it as a
sacred duty. I have faltered in that duty; for I suffered you to
betroth yourself to a man whom I have never been able to trust. But
it is not yet too late to repair that error. You shall never marry
Launcelot Darrell.”

“Why not? If he didn’t commit a forgery, as Eleanor says he did, why
shouldn’t I marry him?”

“Because he has never truly loved you, Laura. You admit that he was
Eleanor’s suitor before he was yours? You admit that, do you not?”

Miss Mason pouted, and sobbed, and choked once or twice before she
answered. Gilbert Monckton waited impatiently for her reply. He was
about as fit to play the Mentor as the young lady whom he had taken
upon himself to lecture. He was blinded and maddened by passionate
regret, cruel disappointment, wounded pride, every feeling which is
most calculated to paralyze a man’s reasoning power, and transform a
Solomon into a fool.

“Yes,” Laura gasped at last; “He did propose to Eleanor first,
certainly. But then she led him on.”

“She led him on!” cried Mr. Monckton. “How?”

Laura looked at him with a perplexed expression of countenance, before
she replied to this eager question.

“Oh, _you_ know!” she said, after a pause; “I can’t exactly describe
_how_ she led him on, but she _did_ lead him on. She walked with him,
and she talked to him; they were always talking together and leaving
me out of the conversation, which was very rude of them, to say the
least, for if I wasn’t intellectual enough for them, and couldn’t
quite understand what they were talking about—for Launcelot would
talk meta——what’s its name? you know; and who _could_ understand
such conversation as that?—they might have talked about things I
_do_ understand, such as Byron and Tennyson. And then she took an
interest in his pictures, and talked about chiaro—thingembob, and
foreshortening, and middle distances, and things just like an artist.
And then she used to let him smoke in the breakfast-parlour when she
was giving me my music lessons; and I should like to know who _could_
play syncopated passages in time, with the smell of tobacco in their
nose, and a fidgety young man reading a crackling newspaper, and
killing flies with his pocket-handkerchief against the window. And then
she sat for Rosalind in his picture. But, good gracious me, it’s no
good going all over it; she led him on.”

Mr. Monckton sighed. There wasn’t much in what his ward had said,
but there was quite enough. Eleanor and Launcelot had been happy and
confidential together. They had talked of metaphysics, and literature,
and poetry, and painting. The young artist had lounged away the summer
mornings, smoking and idling in Miss Vane’s society.

There was very little in all this, certainly, but quite as much as
there generally is in the history of a modern love affair. The age
of romance is gone, with tournaments, and troubadours, and knight
errantry; and if a young gentleman now-a-days spends money in the
purchase of a private box at Covent Garden, and an extra guinea for
a bouquet, or procures tickets for a fashionable flower-show, and is
content to pass the better part of his mornings amidst the expensive
litter of a drawing-room, watching the white fingers of his beloved in
the messy mysteries of _Decalcomanie_, he may be supposed to be quite
as sincerely devoted as if he were to plant his lady’s point-lace
parasol cover in his helmet, and gallop away with a view to having his
head split open in her service.

Mr. Monckton hid his face in his hands and pondered over what he had
heard. Yes, his ward’s foolish talk revealed to him all the secrets of
his wife’s heart. He could see the pretty, sunny morning-room, the
young man lounging in the open window, with fluttering rose-leaves all
about his handsome head. He could see Eleanor seated at the piano,
making believe to listen to her pupil, and glancing back at her lover.
He made the prettiest cabinet picture out of these materials for his
own torment.

“Do you think Eleanor ever loved Launcelot Darrell?” he asked,
by-and-by.

“_Do_ I think so?” cried Miss Mason. “Why, of course I do; and that’s
why she tries to persuade me not to marry him. I love her, and she’s
very good to me,” Laura added, hastily, half ashamed of having spoken
unkindly of the friend who had been so patient with her during the
last few days. “I love her very dearly; but if she hadn’t cared for
Launcelot Darrell, why did she go against my marrying him?”

Gilbert Monckton groaned aloud. Yes, it must be so. Eleanor had loved
Launcelot, and her sudden anger, her violent emotion, had arisen out
of her jealousy. She was not a devoted daughter, nursing a dream of
vengeance against her dead father’s foe; but a jealous and vindictive
woman, bent upon avenging an infidelity against herself.

“Laura,” said Mr. Monckton, “call your maid, and tell her to pack your
things without a moment’s delay.”

“But why?”

“I am going to take you abroad, immediately.”

“Oh, good gracious! And Eleanor——”

“Eleanor will stay here. You and I will go to Nice, Laura, and cure
ourselves of our follies—if we can. Don’t bring any unnecessary load
of luggage. Have your most useful dresses and your linen packed in a
couple of portmanteaus, and let all be ready in an hour’s time. We must
leave Windsor by the four o’clock train.”

“And my wedding things—what am I to do with them?”

“Pack them up. Burn them, if you like,” answered Gilbert Monckton,
leaving his ward to get over her astonishment as she best might.

He encountered her maid in the passage.

“Miss Mason’s portmanteau must be packed in an hour, Jane,” he said. “I
am going to take her away at once for change of air.”

Mr. Monckton went down stairs to his study, and shutting himself in,
wrote a very long letter, the composition of which seemed to give him a
great deal of trouble.

He looked at his watch when this letter was finished, folded, and
addressed. It was a quarter past two. He went up stairs once more to
Laura’s dressing-room, and found that young lady in the wildest state
of confusion, doing all in her power to hinder her maid, under the
pretence of assisting her.

“Put on your bonnet and shawl and go down stairs, Laura,” Mr.
Monckton said, decisively. “Jane will never succeed in packing
those portmanteaus while you are fidgeting her. Go down into the
drawing-room, and wait there till the boxes are packed and we’re ready
to start.”

“But mustn’t I go and say good-bye to Eleanor?”

“Is she still in her own room?”

“Yes, sir,” the maid answered, looking up from the portmanteau before
which she was kneeling. “I peeped into Mrs. Monckton’s room just now,
and she was fast asleep. She has had a great deal of fatigue in nursing
Miss Mason.”

“Very well, then, she had better not be disturbed.”

“But if I’m going to Nice,” remonstrated Laura, “I can’t go so far away
without saying good-bye to Eleanor. She has been very kind to me, you
know.”

“I have changed my mind,” Mr. Monckton said; “I’ve been thinking over
the matter, and I’ve decided on not taking you to Nice. Torquay will do
just as well.”

Miss Mason made a wry face.

“I thought I was to have change of scene,” she said; “Torquay isn’t
change of scene, for I went there once when I was a child. I might have
forgotten Launcelot in quite a strange place, where people talk bad
French and wear wooden shoes, and everything is different; but I shall
never forget him at Torquay.”

Gilbert Monckton did not notice his ward’s lamentation.

“Miss Mason will want you with her, Jane,” he said to the girl. “You
will get yourself ready, please, as soon as you’ve packed those
portmanteaus.”

He went down stairs again, gave his orders about a carriage to take him
to the station, and then walked up and down the drawing-room waiting
for his ward.

In half-an-hour both she and her maid were ready. The portmanteaus were
put into the carriage—the mail phaeton which had brought Eleanor to
Hazlewood two years before—and Mr. Monckton drove away from Tolldale
Priory without having uttered a word of adieu to his wife.




CHAPTER L.

GILBERT’S LETTER.


It was late in the afternoon when Eleanor awoke, aroused by the
clanging of the dinner-bell in the cupola above her head. She had been
worn out by her patient attendance upon Laura during the last week,
and had slept very heavily, in spite of her anxiety to hear what had
happened at the reading of the will. She had seen very little of her
husband since the night of Mr. de Crespigny’s death, and, though the
coldness and restraint of his manner had much distressed her, she
had no idea that he was actually alienated from her, or that he had
suffered his mind to become filled with suspicions against her.

She opened the door of her room, went out into the corridor, and
listened. But all was very still. She could only hear the faint
jingling of glass and silver in the hall below, as the old butler went
to and fro putting the finishing touches to the dinner-table.

“Mr. Monckton might have come to me to tell me about the will,” she
thought: “he must surely know how anxious I am to hear what has been
done.”

She bathed her flushed face, and dressed for dinner as usual. She put
on a black silk dress out of respect for her father’s friend, whose
funeral had been solemnized during her sleep, and with a black lace
shawl upon her shoulders she went down stairs to look for her husband.

She found all very quiet—unnaturally quiet. It is strange how soon
the absence of an accustomed inhabitant makes itself felt in a house,
however quiet the habits of that missing person. Eleanor looked into
the drawing-room and the study, and found them both empty.

“Where is Mr. Monckton?” she asked of the old butler.

“Gone, ma’am.”

“Gone!”

“Yes, ma’am; two hours ago, a’most. You knew he was going, didn’t you,
ma’am?”

The old man’s curiosity was excited by Eleanor’s look of surprise.

“Didn’t you know as master was a-going to take Miss Mason away to the
sea-side for change of air, ma’am?” he asked.

“Yes, yes, I knew that he was going to do so, but not immediately. Did
Mr. Monckton leave no message for me?”

“He left a letter, ma’am. It’s on the mantelpiece in the study.”

Eleanor went to her husband’s room with her heart beating high, and her
cheeks flushed with indignation against him for the slight he had put
upon her. Yes; there was the letter, sealed with his signet-ring. He
was not generally in the habit of sealing his letters, so he must have
looked upon this as one of some importance. Mrs. Monckton tore open
the envelope. She turned pale as she read the first few lines of the
letter. It was written over two sheets of note paper, and began thus:—

  “ELEANOR,—

 “When I asked you to be my wife I told you that in my early youth I
 had been deceived by a woman whom I loved very dearly, though not as
 dearly as I have since loved you. I told you this, and I implored you
 to remember my blighted youth, and to have pity upon me. I entreated
 you to spare me the anguish of a second betrayal, a second awakening
 from my dream of happiness.

 “Surely, if you had not been the most cruel of women, you would have
 been touched by the knowledge that I had already suffered so bitterly
 from a woman’s treachery, and you would have had mercy upon me. But
 you had no mercy. It suited you to come back to this neighbourhood, to
 be near your former lover, Launcelot Darrell.”


The letter dropped from Eleanor’s hands as she read these words.

“My former lover!” she cried; “my lover, Launcelot Darrell! Can my
husband think that? _Can_ he think that I ever loved Launcelot Darrell?”

She picked up the letter and seated herself at her husband’s
writing-table. Then she deliberately reperused the first page of the
lawyer’s epistle.

“How could he write such a letter?” she exclaimed, indignantly. “How
could he think such cruel things of me after I had told him the
truth—after I had revealed the secret of my life?”

She went on with the letter:—

 “From the hour of our return to Tolldale, Eleanor,” wrote Gilbert
 Monckton, “I knew the truth—the hard and cruel truth—very difficult
 for a man to believe, when he has built up his life and mapped out
 a happy future under the influence of a delusion which leaves him
 desolate when it melts away. I knew the worst. I watched you as a man
 only watches the woman upon whose truth his every hope depends, and I
 saw that you still loved Launcelot Darrell. By a hundred evidences,
 small in themselves, but damning when massed together, you betrayed
 your secret. You had made a mercenary marriage, looking to worldly
 advantages to counterbalance your sacrifice of feeling; and you found
 too late that the sacrifice was too hard for you to bear.

 “I watched you day by day, and hour by hour; and I saw that as the
 time for Laura’s marriage approached, you grew hourly more unhappy,
 more restless, more impatient and capricious in your manner towards
 Launcelot.

 “On the night of Maurice de Crespigny’s death the storm burst. You met
 Launcelot Darrell in the Woodlands garden—perhaps by chance, perhaps
 by appointment. You tried to dissuade him against the marriage with
 Laura, as you had tried to dissuade Laura from marrying him; and,
 failing in this, you gave way to a frenzy of jealousy, and accused
 your false lover of an impossible crime.

 “Remember, Eleanor, I accuse you of no deadly sin, no _deliberate_
 treachery to me. The wrong you have done me lies in the fact that
 you married me while your heart was still given to another. I give
 you credit for having tried to conquer that fatal attachment, and I
 attribute your false accusations against Launcelot Darrell to a mad
 impulse of jealousy, rather than the studied design of a base woman. I
 try to think well of you, Eleanor, for I have loved you most dearly;
 and the new life that I had made for myself owed all its brightness to
 my hope of winning your regard. But it is not to be so. I bow my head
 to the decree, and I release you from a bond that has no doubt grown
 odious to you.

 “I beg you, therefore, to write me a final letter, demanding such
 terms of separation as you may think fit. Let the ground of our
 parting be incompatibility of temper. Everything shall be done to
 render your position honourable; and I trust to you to preserve the
 name of Gilbert Monckton’s wife without taint or blemish. Signora
 Picirillo will no doubt act for you in this business, and consent
 to assume the position of your guardian and friend. I leave you in
 full possession of Tolldale Priory, and I go to Torquay with my ward,
 whence I shall depart for the Continent as soon as our separation has
 been adjusted, and my business arrangements made.

 “My address for the next fortnight will be the Post-office, Torquay.

  “GILBERT MONCKTON.”

This was the letter which the lawyer had written to his young wife.
Its contents were like a thunderbolt in the shock which they caused to
Eleanor’s senses. She sat for a long time, reading it over and over
again. For the first time since her marriage she put aside the thought
of her revenge, and began to think seriously of something else.

It was too cruel. Unmixed indignation was the feeling which took
possession of her mind. She had no comprehension of the despair
which had filled Gilbert Monckton’s breast as he wrote that farewell
letter. She did not know how the strong man had done battle with his
suspicions, struggling with every new doubt, and conquering it as
it arose, only to be conquered himself at last, by the irresistible
force of circumstances, every one of which seemed a new evidence
against his wife. Eleanor could not know this. She only knew that her
husband had most bitterly wronged her, and she could feel nothing but
indignation—yet.

She tore the letter into a hundred fragments. She wanted to annihilate
its insulting accusations. How dared he think so vilely of her? Then a
feeling of despair sank into her breast, like some actual burden, chill
and heavy, that bowed her down to the earth, and for the time paralyzed
her energies.

Nothing but failure had met her upon every side. She had been too late
in her attempt to see Maurice de Crespigny before his death. She had
failed to prove Launcelot Darrell’s guilt; though the evidence of his
crime had been in her hands, though she had been herself the witness of
his wrongdoing. Everything had been against her. The chance which had
thrown her across the pathway of the very man she wished to meet had
only given rise to delusive hopes, and had resulted in utter defeat.

And now she found herself suspected and deserted by her husband—the
man whom she had loved and respected with every better feeling of a
generous nature that had become warped and stunted by the all-absorbing
motive of her life. In her indignation against Gilbert Monckton her
hatred of Launcelot Darrell became even more bitter than before, for it
was he who had caused all this—it was he whose treachery had been the
blight of her existence, from the hour of her father’s death until now.

While Eleanor sat thinking over her husband’s letter, the old butler
came to announce dinner, which had been waiting some time for her
coming. I fancy the worthy retainer had been prowling about the hall
meanwhile with the hope of surprising the clue to some domestic mystery
in his mistress’s face as she emerged from the study.

Mrs. Monckton went into the dining-room and made a show of eating her
dinner. She had a motive for doing this, beyond the desire to keep up
appearances which seems natural even to the most impulsive people. She
wanted to hear all about Mr. de Crespigny’s will, and she knew that
Jeffreys, the butler, was sure to be pretty well informed upon the
subject.

She took her accustomed seat at the dinner-table, and Mr. Jeffreys
placed himself behind her. She took a spoonful of clear soup, and then
began to trifle with her spoon.

“Have you heard about Mr. de Crespigny’s will, Jeffreys?” she asked.

“Well, ma’am, to tell the truth, we had Mr. Banks, the baker, from
Hazlewood village, in the servants’ hall not a quarter of an hour ago,
and he _do_ say that Mr. Darrell has got all his great-uncle’s estate,
real and personil—leastways, with the exception of annuities to the
two old mai—the Miss de Crespignys, ma’am, and bein’ uncommon stingy
in their dealin’s, no one will regret as _they_ don’t come into the
fortune. Sherry, ma’am, or ’ock?”

Eleanor touched one of the glasses before her almost mechanically, and
waited while the old man—who was not so skilful and rapid as he had
been in the time of Gilbert Monckton’s father—poured out some wine and
removed her soup-plate.

“Yes, ma’am,” he continued, “Banks of Hazlewood do say that Mr. Darrell
have got the fortune. He heard it from Mrs. Darrell’s ’ousemaid, which
Mrs. Darrell told all the servants directly as she come back from
Woodlands, and were all of a tremble like with joy, the ’ousemaid said;
but Mr. Launcelot, he were as white as a sheet, and hadn’t a word to
say to any one, except the foreign gentleman that he is so friendly
with.”

Eleanor paid very little attention to all these details. She only
thought of the main fact. The desperate game which Launcelot had played
had been successful. The victory was his.

Mrs. Monckton went from the dinner-table to her own room, and with
her own hands dragged a portmanteau out of a roomy old-fashioned
lumber-closet, and began to pack her plainest dresses and the
necessaries of her simple toilet.

“I will leave Tolldale to-morrow morning,” she said. “I will at least
prove to Mr. Monckton that I do not wish to enjoy the benefits of a
_mercenary_ marriage. I will leave this place and begin the world
again. Richard was right; my dream of vengeance was a foolish dream. I
suppose it is right, after all, that wicked people should succeed in
this world, and we must be content to stand by and see them triumph.”

Eleanor could not think without some bitterness of Laura’s abrupt
departure. _She_ could not have been actuated by the same motives that
had influenced Gilbert Monckton. Why, then, had she left without a
word of farewell? Why, Launcelot Darrell was the cause of this sorrow
as well as of every other, for it was jealousy about him that had
prejudiced Laura against her friend.

Early the next morning Eleanor Monckton left Tolldale Priory. She went
to the station at Windsor in a pony carriage which had been reserved
for the use of herself and Laura Mason. She took with her only one
portmanteau, her desk, and dressing-case.

“I am going alone, Martin,” she said to the maid whom Mr. Monckton had
engaged to attend upon her. “You know that I am accustomed to wait upon
myself, and I do not think you could be accommodated where I am going.”

“But you will not be away long, ma’am, shall you?” the young woman
asked.

“I don’t know. I cannot tell you. I have written to Mr. Monckton,”
Eleanor answered, hurriedly.

In the bleak early spring morning she left the home in which she
had known very little happiness. She looked back at the stately
old-fashioned mansion with a regretful sigh.

How happy she _might_ have been within those ivied walls! How happy she
might have been with her husband and Laura; but for the one hindering
cause, the one fatal obstacle—Launcelot Darrell. She thought of what
her life might have been, but for the remembrance of that solemn vow
which was perpetually urging her on to its fulfilment. The love of a
good man, the caressing affection of a gentle girl, the respect of
every living creature round about her, might have been hers; but for
Launcelot Darrell.

She looked back at the old house, gleaming redly behind the leafless
branches of the bare oaks that sheltered it. She could see the oriel
window of the morning-room that Gilbert Monckton had furnished on
purpose for her, the dark crimson of the voluminous curtains, and a
Parian statuette, of his own choosing, glittering whitely against the
red light of the fire within. She saw all this, and regretted it; but
her pride was soothed by the thought that she was running away from
this luxurious home, and all its elegance, to go out alone into a
bleak, uncomfortable world.

“He shall know, at least, that I did not marry him for the sake of a
fine house and horses and carriages,” she thought, as she watched the
terrace chimneys disappear behind the trees. “However meanly he thinks
of me, he shall have no cause to think that.”

It was still very early in the day when Eleanor arrived in London. She
was determined not to go to the Signora, since she must relate all
that had happened, and would no doubt have considerable difficulty in
convincing her old friend that she had chosen the right course.

“The Signora would want me to go back to Tolldale, and to try and
justify myself in the opinion of Gilbert Monckton,” Eleanor thought.
“But I will never humiliate myself to him. He has wronged me; and the
consequences of that wrong must rest upon his own head.”

You see, this young lady’s nature was as undisciplined as it had been
in her girlhood, when she flung herself on her knees in the little
Parisian chamber to take an oath of vengeance against her father’s
destroyer. She had not yet learnt to submit. She had not yet learnt the
most sublime lesson that the Gospel teaches, to suffer unmerited wrong,
and “take it patiently.”

The letter she had written to Gilbert Monckton was very brief.

 “Gilbert,” she wrote, “you have most cruelly wronged me, and I cannot
 doubt that the day will come in which you will know how baseless your
 suspicions have been. Every word that I uttered in Mr. de Crespigny’s
 house upon the night of his death was true. I am quite powerless to
 prove my truth, and I cannot be content to see Launcelot Darrell
 triumph. The mystery of the lost will is more than I can comprehend,
 but I declare that it was in my possession five minutes before I met
 you in the garden. If ever that will should be found, my justification
 will be found with it. I look to you to watch my interests in this
 matter, but I am quite incapable of remaining an inmate of your house
 while you think me the base creature I should be if my accusations
 against Launcelot Darrell were in the slightest degree false. I will
 never return to Tolldale until my truth has been proved. You need not
 fear that I will do anything to bring discredit upon your name. I go
 out into the world to get my own living, as I have done before.

  “ELEANOR MONCKTON.”

This letter expressed very little of the indignation which filled
Eleanor’s breast. Her pride revolted against the outrage which
her husband had inflicted upon her; and she suffered all the more
acutely because beneath her apparent indifference there lurked, in
the innermost recesses of her heart, a true and pure affection for
this cruel Gilbert Monckton, whose causeless suspicions had so deeply
wounded her.

In proportion to the strength of her love was the force of her
indignation, and she went away from Tolldale with angry thoughts raging
in her breast, and buoying her up with a factitious courage.

This influence was still at work when she reached London. She had only
a few pounds in her purse, and it was necessary therefore that she
should begin to get her own living immediately. She had thought of
this during her journey between Windsor and London, and had determined
what to do. She took a cab, and drove to a quiet little hotel in the
neighbourhood of the Strand, left her portmanteau and other packages
there, and then walked to a certain institution for governesses in the
neighbourhood of Cavendish Square. She had been there before, during
her residence with the Signora, to make an inquiry about pupils for the
pianoforte, but had never given her name to the principal.

“I must call myself by a new name,” she thought, “if I want to hide
myself from Gilbert Monckton and from the Signora. I must write to her
directly, by the bye, poor dear, and tell her that I am safe and well;
or else she will be making herself unhappy about me, directly she hears
I have left Tolldale.”

The principal of the Governesses’ Institution was a stately maiden
lady, with a rustling silk dress and glossy braids of grey hair under
a cap of point lace. She received Eleanor with solemn graciousness,
demanded her requirements and her qualifications, and then, with a
gold pencil-case poised lightly between the tips of her taper fingers,
deliberated for a few minutes.

Eleanor sat opposite to her, watching her face very anxiously. She
wanted some home, some asylum, some hiding-place from a world that
seemed altogether against her. She scarcely cared where or what the
place of refuge might be. She wanted to get away from Gilbert Monckton,
who had wronged and insulted her, and from Launcelot Darrell, whose
treachery was always strong enough to triumph over the truth.

But of course she didn’t say this. She only said that she wanted a
situation as musical governess, nursery governess, or companion, and
that the amount of salary was of very little importance to her.

“I understand,” the lady principal replied, slowly, “I perfectly
understand your feeling, Miss——Miss——”

“My name is Villars,” Eleanor answered, quickly, looking down at her
muff as she spoke.

The lady principal’s eyes followed hers, and looked at the muff too. It
was a very handsome sable muff, which had cost five-and-twenty pounds,
and had been given by Mr. Monckton to his wife at the beginning of the
winter. It was not at all in accord with Eleanor’s plain merino dress
and woollen shawl, or with her desire to go out as a governess without
consideration of salary. Miss Barkham, the lady principal, began to
look rather suspiciously at her visitor’s handsome face, and forgot to
finish the sentence she had commenced.

“You can command excellent references, Miss Villars, I suppose?” she
said, coldly.

Eleanor flushed crimson. Here was an insurmountable difficulty at the
very outset.

“References,” she stammered, “will references be necessary?”

“Most decidedly. We could not think of sending out any young lady from
this establishment who could not command first-class references or
testimonials. Some people are satisfied with written testimonials; for
myself, I consider a personal reference indispensable, and I would not
upon my own authority engage any lady without one.”

Eleanor looked very much distressed. She had no idea of diplomatizing
or prevaricating. She blurted out the truth all at once, unappalled by
the stern glances of Miss Barkham.

“I can’t possibly give you a reference,” she said; “my friends do not
know that I am in search of a situation, and they must not know it. I
assure you that I belong to a very respectable family, and am quite
competent to do what I profess to do.”




CHAPTER LI.

MRS. MAJOR LENNARD.

Miss Barkham stared at her visitor with a look of mingled horror and
astonishment.

“You do not surely imagine, Miss Villars,” she said, “that anybody will
engage you in the responsible position of governess to their children
upon no better recommendation than your own, I must confess, rather
_confident_ assertion of your merits?”

“I never told a falsehood in my life, Miss Barkham,” Eleanor answered,
indignantly. “If I am without a friend whom I can ask to testify to my
respectability, it is on account of circumstances which——”

“To be sure,” exclaimed Miss Barkham; “that is the very thing we have
to contend against. This establishment is completely overrun by young
ladies who think there is nothing easier than to turn their backs upon
their friends and their homes, and go out into the world to become the
instructresses of the rising generation. You think me very punctilious
and strait-laced, I dare say, Miss Villars; but I don’t know what
would become of the rising generation if _somebody_ didn’t keep watch
and ward over the doors of the school-room. Young ladies who choose
to feel unhappy in the society of their parents; young ladies who are
disappointed in some sentimental affection; young ladies who fancy
themselves ill-used by their elder sisters; young ladies who, from the
very shallowness of their own minds, cannot be contented anywhere,
all come to us, and want to go out as governesses,—just for a change,
they say, in the hope of finding a little employment that will divert
their minds; as if they had any minds to be diverted! These are the
amateur hangers-on of a very grave and respectable profession, to which
hundreds of estimable and accomplished women have devoted the best and
brightest years of their lives. These are the ignorant and superficial
pretenders who bring their cheap and worthless wares into the market,
in order to undersell the painstaking and patient teachers who have
themselves learned the lessons they profess to teach. And these
amateurs will continue to flourish, Miss Villars, so long as ladies,
who would shudder at the idea of entrusting an expensive silk dress to
an incompetent dressmaker, are willing to confide the care of their
children to an instructress whose highest merit lies in the fact that
she is—cheap. I do not wish to wound your feelings, Miss Villars: but
I assure you I often feel sick at heart, when I see a lady who offers
thirty years’ experience, and all the treasures of a mind carefully and
sedulously cultivated, rejected in favour of some chit of nineteen who
can play one showy fantasia, and disfigure glass vases with scraps of
painted paper, and who will accept twenty pounds a year in payment of
services that are not worth five.”

Eleanor smiled at Miss Barkham’s energetic protest.

“I dare say you are often very much worried by incompetent people,”
she said; “but I assure you _I_ have made no attempt to deceive you. I
don’t profess to do much, you know. I believe I can play pretty well.
May I play you something?” she asked, pointing to an open pianoforte
at one end of the room, a handsome grand, with all Erard’s patent
improvements, on which governesses upon their promotion were in the
habit of showing off.

“I have no objection to hear you play,” Miss Barkham answered; “but
remember, I cannot possibly procure you a situation without either
references or testimonials.”

Eleanor went to the piano, took off her gloves, and ran her fingers
over the keys. She had played very little during the last few months,
for in the feverish preoccupation of her mind she had been unequal to
any feminine employment; too restless and unsettled to do anything but
roam about the house, or sit brooding silently with her hands lying
idle in her lap.

The familiar touch of the keys filled her with a strange pleasure: she
was surprised at the brilliancy of her execution, as good players often
are after an interval of idleness. She played one of Beethoven’s most
sparkling sonatas; and even Miss Barkham, who was perpetually listening
to such performances, murmured a few words of praise.

But before Eleanor had been seated at the piano more than five minutes,
a servant came into the room and presented a card to Miss Barkham, who
rose from her seat with some appearance of vexation.

“Really, I scarcely know what to do about it,” she muttered to herself.
“It’s almost impossible to arrange anything at such very short notice.
Excuse me, Miss Villars,” she added, aloud, to Eleanor; “I am obliged
to see a lady in the next room. Don’t go until I return.”

Eleanor bowed, and went on playing. She finished the sonata; and
then, suddenly catching sight of her wedding-ring and the thick band
of gold studded with diamonds that her husband had given her on her
wedding-day, she stopped to draw the two rings off her finger, and put
them into her purse amongst the few sovereigns that formed her whole
stock of worldly wealth.

She sighed as she did this, for it seemed like putting off her old life
altogether.

“It’s better so,” she said to herself; “I know now that Gilbert must
have thought me false to him from the very first. I can understand his
cold reserve _now_, though it used to puzzle me so much. He changed
almost immediately after our marriage.”

Eleanor Monckton grew very pensive as she remembered that she had been
perhaps herself to blame for the altered manner and no doubt equally
altered feelings of her husband. She had neglected her duty as a wife,
absorbed in her affection as a daughter; she had sacrificed the living
to the dead; and she began to think that Richard Thornton’s advice had
been wiser than she had believed when she refused to listen to it. She
had been wrong altogether. Classic vows of vengeance were all very well
in the days when a Medea rode upon flying dragons and slaughtered her
children upon principle; but a certain inspired teacher, writing a very
long time after that much-to-be-regretted classic age, has declared
that vengeance is the right of divinity alone, and far too terrible an
attribute to be tampered with by fallible mortals, blindly hurling the
belts of heaven against each other’s earthly heads.

She thought this, and grew very melancholy and uncomfortable, and began
to fancy that her impulses had been about the worst guides that she
could have chosen. She began to think that she had not acted so very
wisely in running away from Tolldale Priory in the first heat of her
indignation, and that she might have done better perhaps by writing
a temperate letter of justification to Gilbert Monckton, and quietly
abiding the issue. But she had chosen her path now, and must stand by
her choice, on pain of appearing the weakest and most cowardly of women.

“My letter is posted,” she said to herself. “Gilbert will receive it
to-morrow morning. I _should_ be a coward to go back; for, however much
I may have been to blame in the matter, he has treated me very badly.”

She wiped away some tears that had come into her eyes as she took the
rings from her wedding finger, and then began to play again.

This time she dashed into one of the liveliest and most brilliant
fantasias she could remember, a very _pot pourri_ of airs; a scientific
hodge-podge of Scotch melodies; now joyous, now warlike and savage, now
plaintive and tender, always capricious in the extreme, and running
away every now and then into the strangest variations, the most
eccentric cadences. The piece was one of Thalberg’s _chef-d’œuvres_,
and Eleanor played it magnificently. As she struck the final chords,
sharp and rapid as a rattling peal of musketry, Miss Barkham re-entered
the room.

She had the air of being rather annoyed, and she hesitated a little
before speaking to Eleanor, who rose from the piano and began to put on
her gloves.

“Really, Miss Villars,” she said, “it is most incomprehensible to me,
but since Mrs. Lennard herself wishes it, I——”

She stopped and fidgeted a little with the gold pencil-case hanging to
her watch-chain.

“I can’t at all understand this sort of thing,” she resumed; “however,
of course I wash my hands of all responsibility. Have you any objection
to travel, Miss Villars?” she asked, suddenly.

Eleanor opened her eyes with a look of astonishment at this abrupt
question.

“Objection to travel?” she repeated; “I——”

“Have you any objection to go abroad—to Paris, for instance,—if I could
obtain you a situation?”

“Oh, no,” Eleanor answered, with a sigh, “not at all; I would just as
soon go to Paris as anywhere else.”

“Very well, then, if that is the case, I think I can get you a
situation immediately. There is a lady in the next room who was here
yesterday, and who really gave me a most severe headache with her
fidgety, childish ways. However, she wants to meet with a young lady
as a companion _immediately_—that is the grand difficulty. She leaves
London for Paris by this evening’s mail, and she put off engaging the
person she required until yesterday afternoon, when she came to me in a
fever of anxiety, and wanted me to introduce her to a lady instanter.
She stopped all the afternoon in the next room, and I took ever so
many young ladies in to her, all of whom seemed well qualified for the
situation, which really demands very little. But not one of them would
suit Mrs. Lennard. She was very polite to them, and made all kinds
of affable speeches to them, and dismissed them in the most ladylike
manner; and then she told me afterwards that she didn’t take a fancy
to them, and she was determined not to engage any one she didn’t take
a fancy to, as she wanted to be very fond of her companion, and make
quite a sister of her. That was what she said, and good gracious me,”
cried Miss Barkham, “how am I to find her somebody she can take a fancy
to, and make a sister of, at a quarter-of-an-hour’s notice? I assure
you, Miss Villars, my head felt quite in a whirl after she went away
yesterday afternoon; and it’s beginning to be in a whirl again now.”

Eleanor waited very patiently while Miss Barkham endeavoured to collect
her scattered senses.

“I can scarcely hope this very capricious lady will take a fancy to
me,” she said, smiling.

“Why, my dear,” exclaimed Miss Barkham, “that’s the very thing I came
to tell you. She _has_ taken a fancy to you.”

“Taken a fancy to me!” repeated Eleanor; “but she has not seen me.”

“Of course not, my dear. But she really is the most confusing, I may
almost saw bewildering, person, I ever remember meeting with. I was
in the next room talking to this Mrs. Lennard, who is very pretty and
fashionable-looking, only a little untidy in her dress, when you began
to play that Scotch fantasia. Mrs. Lennard stopped to listen, and after
she had listened a few moments she cried out suddenly, ‘Now I dare say
that’s an old frump!’ I said, ‘What, ma’am?’ for upon my word, my dear,
I didn’t know whether she meant the piece, or the piano, or what. ‘I
dare say the lady who is playing is an old frump, she said. ‘Old frumps
almost always play well; in point of fact old frumps are generally very
clever. But I’m determined not to have any one I can’t make a sister
of; and I _must_ have one by three o’clock this afternoon, or Major
Lennard will be cross, and I shall go mad.’ Well, Miss Villars, I told
Mrs. Lennard your age, and described your appearance and manners,
that is to say, as well as I was able to do so after our very brief
acquaintance, and I had no sooner finished than she exclaimed, ‘That
will do; if she can play Scotch melodies like that, and is nice, I’ll
engage her.’ I then explained to Mrs. Lennard that you could give no
references; ‘and that, of course,’ I added, ‘would be an insuperable
objection;’ but she interrupted me in a manner that would have appeared
very impertinent in any one but her, and cried out, ‘Insuperable
fiddlesticks! If she’s nice I’ll engage her. She can play to me all
the morning, while I paint upon velvet;’ and you’re to come with me,
please, Miss Villars, and be introduced to her.”

Eleanor took up her muff and followed Miss Barkham on to the landing,
but at this moment three ladies appeared upon the top stair, and the
principal of the establishment was called upon to receive them.

“If you’ll go in by yourself, my dear,” she whispered to Eleanor,
pointing to the door of the back drawing-room, “I shall be much
obliged. You’ll find Mrs. Lennard a most affable person.”

Eleanor readily assented. She opened the door and went into the
primly-furnished back drawing-room. Mrs. Major Lennard was a little
woman, and she was standing on tiptoe upon the hearth-rug, in order
to survey herself in the chimney-glass while she re-arranged the pale
blue strings of her black velvet bonnet. Eleanor paused near the door,
waiting for her to turn round, and wondering what she was like, as the
face in the glass was not visible from where Mrs. Monckton stood.

The lady employed a considerable time in the important operation
of tying her bonnet-strings, then suddenly hearing the rustling of
Eleanor’s dress as she advanced a few paces, Mrs. Lennard uttered an
exclamation, and turned round.

“You naughty girl, you quite startled me,” she cried.

Not so much as she had startled Eleanor, who could not repress a cry
of surprise at the sight of her face. It was a very pretty face, very
young-looking, though Mrs. Major Lennard was nearly forty years of age.
A fair childish face, with pink cheeks, turquoise-blue eyes, and the
palest, softest bands of flaxen hair; rather an insipid, German kind of
beauty, perhaps, but very perfect of its kind.

But that which had startled Eleanor was not the babyish, delicate
prettiness of the face, but the strong resemblance which it bore to
Laura Mason. It was the same face after twenty years, not of wear and
tear, but of very careful preservation. This lady, in appearance and
manner, was exactly what Laura must most surely become if she lived to
be seven-and-thirty years of age.




CHAPTER LII.

GOING BACK TO PARIS.


Eleanor was so completely bewildered by this extraordinary likeness
that she remained for some moments staring at Mrs. Major Lennard in
silent surprise.

“Goodness me, my dear!” exclaimed the lady, “how astonished you look!
I hope I’m not a GUY. Frederick—that’s Major Lennard, you know—never
liked this bonnet, and really I’m beginning quite to dislike it myself.
I do think it’s _pokey_. But never mind that, my dear Miss—Villars, I
think Miss Barkham said,—a very nice person, Miss Barkham, isn’t she?
but rather prim. I’ve got all sorts of business to settle between this
and eight o’clock, for Fred _will_ travel by the night mail, because
he sleeps all the way, and of course that makes the journey shorter—in
consequence of which I’ve never seen Dover, except in the dark, and I
always think of it with the lamps lighted and the pier slippery, and
everybody hurrying and pushing, like a place in a dream. But the first
question, my dear, that we’ve got to settle, is whether you like me,
and think you could make a sister of me?”

This question, asked very eagerly, was really too much for poor Eleanor.

“Oh, please don’t look so surprised,” Mrs. Lennard exclaimed,
entreatingly; “you make me fancy I’m a guy, and you see there’s really
no time to be lost, and we must decide immediately if you please. I
was here all yesterday afternoon, and I saw legions of ladies, but
there wasn’t one that I could take a fancy to, and my only motive for
engaging a companion is to have somebody that I shall like very much,
and always feel at home with; and I want some one who can play the
piano and be agreeable and lively, and I’m sure you’re the very person,
dear, and if you only think you can like me as well as I’m sure I shall
like you, we can settle the business at once.”

“But you know that I can give you no references,” Eleanor said,
hesitatingly.

“Of course I do,” answered Mrs. Lennard. “Miss Barkham told me all
about it. As _if_ I thought you’d committed a murder, or done something
horrid, just because you can’t pounce upon half-a-dozen people ready
to declare you’re an uncanonized saint all in a moment. I like your
looks, my dear, and when I like people’s looks at first sight, I
generally like _them_ afterwards. And you play magnificently; I only
wish I could; and I used to play the overture to ‘Semiramide’ before
I was married, but as Frederick doesn’t like overtures, and as we’ve
been scampering about the world ever since, in the cabins of ships,
and in tents, and all sorts of places where you couldn’t have pianos
unless you had them made on purpose, without legs, I’ve gone backwards
in my music till I can’t play so much as a polka, without skipping the
difficult parts.”

Mrs. Lennard went on to say that the matter of salary was a question to
be settled between Miss Villars and the Major.

“I always leave money matters to Frederick,” she said, “for though he
can’t add up the bills, he looks as if he could, and that’s _some_
check upon people. But you’ll have to wait for your quarter’s money now
and then, I dare say, dear, because we’re often a little behind-hand,
you know, and if you don’t mind that, it’ll be all the better for you,
as Fred’s almost sure to give you a silk dress when your quarter comes
due and he can’t pay you; that’s what he calls a sop to Cerberus, and
I’m sure the money he spends in keeping people ‘sweet,’ as he calls it,
would keep us altogether if we paid ready money. Now, is it a settled
thing, Miss Villars? Will you accept the situation?”

Eleanor assented without hesitation. She heard very little of Mrs.
Lennard’s good-natured babble. Her whole mind was absorbed by the sense
of her defeat, and by the feeling that she had no further chance of
victory over Launcelot Darrell. She despaired, but she did not submit.
She was only desperate and reckless, ready to go anywhere, and finish
the useless remainder of her existence anyhow. She was not prepared to
begin a new life upon a new plan, casting the old scheme of her life
behind her, as a mistake and a delusion. She was not able to do this
yet.

While Mrs. Lennard was gathering together a lot of frivolous-looking
little whity-brown paper parcels that seemed to bear a strong family
resemblance to herself, Miss Barkham came into the room to ascertain
the result of the interview between the two ladies. Mrs. Lennard
expressed herself in the most rapturous manner about Eleanor, paid some
small fee for the benefit of the institution, and departed, carrying
her parcels and taking Eleanor with her.

She allowed her companion to assist her with the parcels, after a
little good-natured contention, and at the nearest corner summoned a
cab which was dawdling lazily along.

“Of course the man will overcharge us,” Mrs. Lennard said, “but we must
be prepared for that, and really I’d rather be overcharged than have a
row, as we generally have when I’m with the major, and summonses and
counter-summonses, and all sorts of disagreeables; not that I mind that
half so much as foreign cabmen, who get excited, and dance upon the
pavement and make wild noises if you don’t satisfy them; and I’m sure I
don’t know what _would_ satisfy foreign cabmen.”

Mrs. Lennard took out her watch, which was a pretty little Geneva toy
with an enamelled back, ornamented with the holes that had once held
diamonds. An anxious and intensely studious expression came over Mrs.
Lennard’s face as she looked at this watch, which was overweighted by a
heap of incomprehensible charms, amongst which chaotic mass of golden
frivolity, a skeleton, a watering-pot, a coffin, and a Dutch oven were
distinguishable.

“It’s half-past five by _me_,” Mrs. Lennard said, after a profound
contemplation of the Geneva, “so I should think it must be _about_ a
quarter to three.”

Eleanor took out her own watch and settled the question. It was only
half-past two.

“Then I’ve gained another quarter of an hour,” exclaimed Mrs. Lennard:
“that’s the worst of pretty watches; they always will go too much, or
else stop altogether. Freddy bought me my watch, and he gave me my
choice as to whether he should spend the money in purple enamel and
diamonds, or works, and I chose the purple enamel. But then, of course
I didn’t know the diamonds would drop out directly,” Mrs. Lennard
added, thoughtfully.

She drove about to half-a-dozen shops, and collected more whity-brown
paper parcels, a band-box, a bird-cage, a new carpet-bag, a dog’s
collar, a packet of tea, and other incongruous merchandise, and then
ordered the man to drive to the Great Northern Hotel.

“We’re staying at the Great Northern, my dear,” she said, after giving
this order. “We very often stay at hotels, for Frederick thinks it’s
cheaper to pay fifteen shillings a day for your rooms than to have
a house, and servants’ wages, and coals and candles, and lard, and
blacklead, and hearthstone, and all those little things that run away
with so much money. And I should like the Great Northern very much if
the corridors weren’t so long and the waiters so stern. I always think
waiters at grand hotels _are_ stern. They seem to look at one as if
they knew one was thinking of the bill, and trying to calculate whether
it would be under ten pounds. But, oh, good gracious!” exclaimed Mrs.
Lennard, suddenly, “what a selfish creature I am; I’ve quite forgotten
all this time that of course you’ll want to go home to your mamma and
papa, and tell them where you’re going, and get your boxes packed, and
all that.”

Eleanor shook her head with a sad smile.

“I have no mother or father to consult,” she said; “I am an orphan.”

“Are you?” cried Mrs. Lennard; “then it must have been our destiny to
meet, for I am an orphan, too. Ma died while I was a baby, and poor pa
died soon after my marriage. He was disappointed in my marriage, poor
dear old thing, though I’m glad to think it wasn’t that, but gout in
the stomach, that killed him. But you’ll want to see your friends, Miss
Villars, won’t you, before you leave London?”

“No,” Eleanor answered: “I shall write to the only friends I have. I
don’t want to see any one; I don’t want any one to know where I am
going. I left my portmanteau at an hotel in Norfolk Street, and I shall
be glad if you will let me call for it.”

Mrs. Lennard gave the necessary order; the cabman drove to the
hotel where Eleanor had left her portmanteau, and thence to the
Great Northern, where Mrs. Lennard conducted her new companion
to a very handsome apartment on the ground-floor, opening into a
palatial bed-chamber, whose splendour was a good deal impaired by the
circumstances that the stately Arabian bed, the massive easy-chairs,
the sofa, the dressing-table, and even the washhand-stand were loaded
with divers articles of male and female attire, which seemed to have
been flung here and there by some harmless maniac disporting himself
about the room.

In the very centre of all this disorder, upon a great black leather
military travelling-case, sat a big broad-chested man of about forty,
with a good-natured, sunburnt face, a very fierce auburn moustache, and
a thick stubble of crisp, wavy, auburn hair, cut close to his head, in
the development of which a disciple of Mr. George Coombe would have
scarcely discovered the organs that make a man either a general or a
philosopher. This sunburnt, good-humoured looking gentleman had taken
off his coat for the better accomplishment of his herculean labours;
and, with his arms folded and his legs crossed, with an embroidered
slipper balanced upon the extremity of his toes, and a meerschaum pipe
in his mouth, he sat resting himself, after taking the initiatory step
of dragging everything out of the drawers and wardrobe.

“Oh, you _lazy_ Freddy!” cried Mrs. Lennard, looking in at her lord and
master with a reproachful countenance, “is that all you’ve done?”

“Where’s the blue barège with the flounces to go?” roared the major,
in the voice of an amiable Stentor. “I couldn’t do anything till I
knew that, and I’ve been waiting for you to come home. Have you got a
companion?”

“Hush! yes! she’s in the nest room; such a dear, and awfully pretty.
If you stare at her much I shall be jealous, Freddy, for you know you
_are_ a starer, though you never will confess it. _I’ve_ seen you, in
Regent Street, when you’ve thought I’ve been looking at the bonnets,”
added the lady, reproachfully.

Upon this the major got up, and, lifting his wife in his arms, gave her
such a hug as a well-disposed bear might have bestowed upon the partner
of his den. Major Lennard was about six feet one and a half in the
embroidered slippers, and was as strong as a gladiator in good training.

“Come and be introduced to her,” exclaimed Mrs. Lennard; and she led
her husband, in his shirt-sleeves, nothing abashed, into the adjoining
sitting-room.

The major’s conversational powers were not very startling. He made a
few remarks about the weather, which were more courteous than original.
He asked Eleanor if she was hungry, if she would have luncheon, or wait
for a six o’clock dinner, and if she was a good sailor. Then, suddenly
coming to a standstill, he demanded soda water and brandy.

It was the habit of this amiable man to require this beverage on every
possible occasion. He was by no means a drunkard, though he was one of
those good-natured noisy creatures who can never be convivial without
getting tipsy; but his existence was one perpetual absorption of soda
water and brandy. Why he drank this mixture, which the uninitiated are
apt to consider insipid, was a mystery only to be explained by himself.
He could not have been perpetually thirsty; and I am inclined to think
that this soda water and brandy was the desperate resource of a feeble
intellect craving some employment, rather than a physical want.

The major and his wife retired to the bedroom and began their packing.
When matters grew very desperate Eleanor was summoned as a forlorn
hope, and did her best to reduce the chaos into something like order.
This process occupied the time until six o’clock, when the major put on
his coat and sat down to dinner.

But even during dinner the packing business was not altogether
suspended, for every now and then, when there was a little pause in the
banquet, Mrs. Lennard jumped up from the table, and ran into the next
room with her workbox, or her desk, or something from the mantelpiece
or one of the sofa-tables—sometimes a book, sometimes a paper-knife, a
thimble, a pair of scissors, a pen-wiper, or a packet of envelopes,—and
then scampered back to her place before the waiter re-entered the room,
and tried to look as if she hadn’t left her seat. The major meanwhile
worked steadily on with his knife and fork, only looking up from his
plate to attend to the wants of Eleanor and his wife.

At last everything was ready. The addresses were fastened to the
boxes and portmanteaus. A bewildering canary-bird—which rejoiced in
every kind of noise and confusion, and had been excruciatingly loud
and shrill all the afternoon—was inducted into the new brass cage
which Mrs. Lennard had bought for it. A sharp little black-and-tan
terrier, the property of the major, was invested in the new collar, and
securely padlocked; Eleanor and Mrs. Lennard put on their shawls and
bonnets; the major made himself gigantic by the addition of a rough
great-coat, a Scotch plaid, and half-a-dozen yards of woollen comforter
to his normal bulk; the bill was paid at the very last moment, while
the luggage was being piled up on the top of an extra cab; and Major
Lennard and his companions departed at a rattling pace for the London
Bridge terminus. There was just time enough for the major to get the
tickets and choose a comfortable carriage, before the train started.
Away they flew through the darkness of the bleak March night, and
Eleanor felt that every throb of the shrieking engine made the step
that she had taken more irrevocable.

“There was not a word in Gilbert’s letter that expressed sorrow at
parting from me,” she thought. “I had worn out his love, I suppose.”

It was eleven o’clock when they got to Dover. Major Lennard slept all
the way, with the lappets of his travelling cap which was a sort of
woollen caricature of a Knight Templar’s helmet, drawn closely over his
ears. Mrs. Lennard, who was very wide awake all the time, sat opposite
to her husband, with the canary bird on her lap. He had grown quiet
at last, and had retired from the world under a tent of green baize.
The bird’s mistress made up for his silence by talking incessantly
throughout the journey; but it only seemed to Eleanor as if she had
a second Laura for her companion, and the succession of her own sad
thoughts was scarcely broken by Mrs. Lennard’s conversation.

They arrived in Paris the next morning in time for breakfast at the
great Hôtel du Palais, a monstrous building, newly erected, and rich
in the glitter of gilding and the glow of colour. Here the major took
up his abode, after deliberately expounding to his wife and Eleanor
the theory that the best and most expensive hotels are always the
cheapest—in the end. This moral had been the rule of the major’s life,
and had very often brought him alarmingly near the awful abysses of
insolvency.

The gorgeous apartments in which Eleanor found herself were very unlike
the low-ceilinged little sitting-room in the Rue de l’Archevêque;
but her mind went back to that sad time, nevertheless. She spent
the morning in the agreeable employment of unpacking Mrs. Lennard’s
wardrobe, while the major and his wife sailed out of the great hotel to
sun themselves in the Rue Rivoli and on the Boulevards, and to wind up
with a drive in the Bois, and a little dinner at Vèfour’s. When she
had completed this most wearisome task, and had arranged all the scraps
of lace and ribbons, the gloves and collars, and feminine furbelows, in
a buhl chest of drawers and a gorgeous ebony and gold wardrobe, Mrs.
Monckton put on her bonnet and shawl, and went out into the busy street.

The tears rushed up to her eyes as she looked at the bright vista
before her, and heard the roll of the drum, and the tramp of soldiers’
feet in the courts of the Louvre. Yes, there was the street along which
she had walked by her father’s side on the last day of his blighted
life. Her hands clenched themselves involuntarily as she remembered
that day; and that other bitter day of anguish in which she had knelt
upon the ground and sworn to be revenged upon George Vane’s enemy.

How had she kept her oath? She smiled bitterly as she thought of the
four years that had passed since then, and the strange chance that had
flung Launcelot Darrell in her way.

“I went away from this place while he was here,” she thought. “I come
back to it now that he is in England. Is it my destiny, I wonder,
always to fail in everything I attempt?”

She went to the Rue de l’Archevêque. Nothing was changed. The same
butcher was busy in the shop; the same faded curtains of flowered
damask hung behind the windows.




CHAPTER LIII.

MARGARET LENNARD’S DELINQUENCIES.


Mrs. Major Lennard was very kind to Eleanor, and if kindness and
friendliness on the part of her employers could have made Mrs. Monckton
comfortable, she might have been entirely so in her new position.

But comfort was a noun substantive whose very meaning must, I think,
have been utterly incomprehensible to Major and Mrs. Lennard. They had
married very young, had started in life all wrong, and had remained
in a perpetual state of muddle, both mental and physical, ever since.
They were like two children who had played at being grown-up people for
twenty years or so; and who were as entirely childish in their play now
as they had been at the very beginning. To live with them was to exist
in an atmosphere of bewilderment and confusion; to have any dealings
whatever with them was to plunge at once into a chaos of disorder,
out of which the clearest intellect could scarcely emerge without
having suffered complete disorganization. The greatest misfortune of
these two people was the likeness they bore to each other. Had Major
Lennard been a man of vigorous intellect and strong will, or had he
been merely possessed of the average allowance of common sense, he
might have ruled his wife, and introduced some element of order
into his existence. On the other hand, if Mrs. Lennard had been a
sensible woman, she would no doubt have henpecked her husband, and
would have rescued the good-natured soldier from a hundred follies, by
a well-timed frown, or a sharp matronly nudge, as the occasion might
demand.

But they were both alike. They were two overgrown children of forty
years of age; and they looked upon the world as great play-room, whose
inhabitants had no better occupation than to find amusement, and shirk
the schoolmaster. They were generous and kind-hearted to a degree that,
in the opinion of their wiser acquaintance, bordered upon foolishness.
They were imposed upon on every side, and had been imposed upon during
twenty years, without acquiring any moral wealth in the way of wisdom,
from their very costly experience. The major had within the last twelve
months left the army on half-pay, on the death of a maiden aunt, who
had left him eight hundred a year. Up to the date of receiving this
welcome legacy, the soldier and his wife had been compelled to exist
upon Major Lennard’s pay, eked out by the help of stray benefactions
which he received from time to time from his rich relatives. The
family to which the ponderous officer belonged was very numerous and
aristocratic, owning as its chief a marquis, who was uncle to the major.

So the two big children had decided upon enjoying themselves very much
for the rest of their days, and as a commencement of this new life of
idleness and enjoyment, Major Lennard had brought his wife to Paris,
whence they were to go to Baden-Baden, to meet some of the major’s
aristocratic cousins.

“He might come in for the title himself, my dear,” Mrs. Lennard told
Eleanor, “if seventeen of his first cousins, and first cousins once
removed, would die. But, as I told poor papa, when he grumbled at my
marrying so badly, you can’t expect seventeen cousins to go off all in
a minute, just to oblige us by making Freddy a marquis.”

Perhaps nothing could have been happier for Eleanor than this life of
confusion, this scrambling and unsettled existence, in which the mind
was kept in a tumult by trifling cares and agitations; for in this
perpetual disorganization of her intellect, the lonely girl had no time
to think of her own troubles, or of the isolated position which she
had chosen for herself. It was only at night, when she went to bed,
in a small apartment very high up in the Hôtel du Palais, and about a
quarter of an hour’s walk from the chamber of the major and his wife,
that she had time to think of Launcelot Darrell’s triumph and her
husband’s unjust suspicions; and even then she could rarely brood very
long upon her troubles, for she was generally exhausted alike in mind
and body by the confusion and excitement of the day, and more likely
to fall asleep and dream of her sorrows than to lie awake and think of
them.

Those dreams were more troublesome to her than all the bewilderment of
the day, for in them she was perpetually renewing the old struggle with
Launcelot Darrell, perpetually upon the eve of victory, but never quite
victorious.

The major lingered in Paris much longer than he had intended, for the
big children found the city of boulevards a most delightful playground,
and frittered away a great deal of money upon expensive dinners at
renowned restaurants, ices, opera tickets, new bonnets, Piver’s gloves,
Lubin’s perfumes, and coach hire.

They stopped at the Hôtel du Palais, still acting on the major’s
theory, that the most expensive hotels are the cheapest—in the end.
They dined occasionally at the table-d’hôte, with two or three hundred
companions, and wasted a good deal of time in the great saloons,
playing at bagatelle, peering into stereoscopes, turning over the daily
papers, reading stray paragraphs here and there, or pouring over a
chapter of a romance in the _feuilleton_, until brought to a standstill
by a disheartening abundance of difficult words.

After breakfast, the major left his wife and her companion, either to
loll in the reading-room, to stroll about the great stone quadrangle,
smoking cigars, and drinking occasional brandy and soda, or to read
the English papers at Galignani’s, or to wait for the post, or to
meet a British acquaintance at Hill’s café, or to stare at the raw
young soldiers exercising in the courtyards of the Louvre, or the
copper-faced Zouaves who had done such wonderful work in the Crimea;
or perhaps to stumble across some hoary-headed veteran who had fought
under Napoleon the First, to make friendly speeches to him in bad
French, with every verb in a bewilderingly impossible tense, and to
treat him to little glasses of pale cognac.

Then Mrs. Lennard brought out her frame and her colour-box, and her
velvets and brushes, and all the rest of her implements, and plunged
at once into the delightful pursuit of painting upon velvet—an
accomplishment which this lady had only newly acquired in six lessons
for a guinea, during her last brief sojourn in London.

“The young person who taught me called herself Madame Ascanio de
Brindisi—but, oh! Miss Villars, if ever there was a Cockney in this
world, I think she was one—and she said in her advertisement, that
anybody could earn five pounds a week easily at this elegant and
delightful occupation; but I am sure I don’t know how _I_ should ever
earn five pounds a week, Miss Villars, for I’ve been nearly a month
at this one sofa cushion, and it has cost five-and-thirty shillings
already, and isn’t finished yet, and the major doesn’t like to see me
work, and I’m obliged to do it while he’s out; just as if it was a
crime to paint upon velvet. If you _would_ mend those gloves, dear,
that are split across the thumb—and really Piver’s gloves at four
francs, five-and-twenty what’s its names? oughtn’t to do so, though the
major says it’s my own fault, because I will buy six-and-a-quarters—I
should be _so_ much obliged,” Mrs. Lennard added, entreatingly, as she
seated herself at her work in one of the long windows. “I shall get on
splendidly,” she exclaimed, “if the Emperor doesn’t go for a drive; but
if he does, I must leave off my work and look at him—he’s such a dear!”

Eleanor was very willing to make herself what the advertisements call
“generally useful,” to the lady who had engaged her. She was a very
high-spirited girl, we know, quick to resent any insult, sensitive and
proud; but she had no false pride. She felt no shame in doing what
she had undertaken to do; and if, for her own convenience, she had
taken the situation of a kitchen-maid, she would have performed the
duties of that situation to the best of her ability. So she mended Mrs.
Lennard’s gloves, and darned that lady’s delicate lace collars, and
tried to infuse something like order into her toilette, and removed
the damp ends of cigars, which it was the major’s habit to leave about
upon every available piece of furniture, and made herself altogether so
useful that Mrs. Lennard declared that she would henceforward be unable
to live without her.

“But I know how it will be, you nasty provoking thing!” the major’s
wife exclaimed; “you’ll go on in this way, and you’ll make us fond of
you, and just as we begin to doat upon you, you’ll go and get married
and leave us, and then I shall have to get another old frump like
Miss Pallister, who lived with me before you, and who never would do
anything for me scarcely, but was always talking about belonging to
a good family, and not being used to a life of dependence. I’m sure
I used to wish she had belonged to a bad family. But I know it’ll be
so; just as we’re most comfortable with you, you’ll go and marry some
horrid creature.”

Eleanor blushed crimson as she shook her head.

“I don’t think that’s very likely,” she said.

“Ah! you say that,” Mrs. Lennard answered, doubtfully, “but you can’t
convince me quite so easily. I know you’ll go and marry; but you don’t
know the troubles you may bring upon yourself if you marry young—as I
did,” added the lady, dropping her brush upon her work, and breathing a
profound sigh.

“Troubles, my dear Mrs. Lennard!” cried Eleanor. “Why, it seems to me
as if you never could have had any sorrow in your life.”

“‘Seems, Hamlet!’” exclaimed Mrs. Lennard, casting up her eyes
tragically; “‘nay, it is; _I_ know not seems,’ as the Queen says to
Hamlet—or perhaps it’s Hamlet says so to the Queen, but that doesn’t
matter. Oh, Miss Villars! my life might have been very happy, perhaps,
but for the blighting influence of my own crime; a crime that I can
never atone for—_nev-arr_!”

Eleanor would have been quite alarmed by this speech, but for the
tone of enjoyment with which Mrs. Lennard gave utterance to it. She
had pushed aside her frame and huddled her brushes together upon the
buhl table—there was nothing but buhl and ormolu, and velvet-pile and
ebony, at the Hôtel du Palais, and an honest mahogany chair, a scrap of
Kidderminster carpet, or a dimity curtain, would have been a relief to
the overstrained intellect—and she sat with her hands clasped upon the
edge of the table, and her light blue eyes fixed in a tragic rapture.

“Crime, Mrs. Lennard!” Eleanor repeated, in that tone of horrified
surprise which was less prompted by actual terror, than by the feeling
that some exclamation of the kind was demanded of her.

“Yes, my dear, ker-rime! ker-rime! is not too harsh a word for the
conduct of a woman who jilts the man that loves her on the very eve of
the day appointed for the wedding, after a most elaborate trousseau has
been prepared at _his_ expense, to say nothing of heaps of gorgeous
presents, and diamonds as plentiful as dirt—and elopes with another
man. Nothing could be more dreadful than that, could it, Miss Villars?”

Eleanor felt that she was called upon to say that nothing _could_ be
more dreadful, and said so accordingly.

“Oh, don’t despise me, then, or hate me, please, Miss Villars,” cried
Mrs. Lennard; “I know you’ll feel inclined to do so; but don’t. I did
it!—I did it, Miss Villars. But I’m not altogether such a wretch as I
may seem to you. It was chiefly for my poor pa’s sake; it was, indeed.”

Eleanor was quite at a loss to know how Mrs. Leonard’s bad conduct to
her affianced husband could have benefited that lady’s father, and she
said something to that effect.

“Why, you see, my dear, in order to explain that, I must go back to the
very beginning, which was when I was at school.”

As Mrs. Lennard evidently derived very great enjoyment from this kind
of conversation, Eleanor was much too good-natured to discourage it; so
the painting upon velvet was abandoned, for that morning at least, and
the major’s wife gave a brief synopsis of her history for the benefit
of Mrs. Monckton.

“You must know, my dear,” Mrs. Lennard began, “my poor pa was a country
gentleman; and he had once been very rich; or at least his family—and
he belonged to a very old family, though not as aristocratic as the
major’s—had once been very rich; but somehow or other, through the
extravagance of one and another, poor pa was dreadfully poor, and his
estate, which was in Berkshire, was heavily—what’s its name?—mortgaged.”

Eleanor gave a slight start at the word “Berkshire,” which did not
escape Mrs. Lennard.

“You know Berkshire?” she said.

“Yes, some part of it.”

“Well, my dear, as I said before, poor papa’s estate was very heavily
mortgaged, and he’d scarcely anything that he could call his own,
except the rambling old country-house in which I was born; and beyond
that he was awfully in debt, and in constant dread of his creditors
sending him to prison, where he might have finished his days, for there
wasn’t the least possibility of his ever paying his debts by anything
short of a miracle. Now, of course all this was very sad. However, I
was too young to know much about it, and papa sent me to a fashionable
school at Bath, where his sisters had gone when they were young, and
where he knew he could get credit for my education to be finished.”

Eleanor, hard at work at the split gloves, listened rather
indifferently to this story at first; but little by little she began to
be interested in it, until at last she let her hands drop into her lap,
and left off working, in order the better to attend to Mrs. Lennard’s
discourse.

“Well, Miss Villars, it was at that school that I met the ruling star
of my fate—that is to say, the major, who was then dreadfully young,
without even the least pretence of whiskers, and always sitting in a
pastrycook’s shop in the fashionable street, eating strawberry ices.
He had only just got his commission, and he was quartered at Bath
with his regiment, and his sister Louisa was my schoolfellow at Miss
Florathorne’s, and he called one morning to see her, and I happened
that very morning to be practising in the drawing-room, the consequence
of which was that we met, and from that hour our destinies were sealed.

“I won’t dwell upon our meetings, which Louisa managed for us, and
which were generally dreadfully inconvenient, for Fred used to clamber
up the garden wall by the toes of his boots—and he has told me since
that the brickwork used to scratch off all the varnish, which of course
made it dreadfully expensive—but what will not love endure?—and hook
himself on as it were; and it was in that position, with nothing of
him visible below his chin, that he made me a most solemn offer of his
hand and heart. I was young and foolish, Miss Villars, and I accepted
him, without one thought of my poor papa, who was the most indulgent of
parents, and who had always let me do everything I liked, and indeed
owed upwards of fifty pounds, at a toyshop in Windsor, for dolls and
things that he bought me before I was grown up.

“Well, from that hour Frederick and I were engaged, and he dropped a
turquoise ring in among the bushes at the bottom of the garden the next
morning, and Louisa and I had upwards of an hour’s work to find it. We
were engaged! But we were not long allowed to bask in the sunshine of
requited affection, for a fortnight after this Frederick’s regiment
was ordered out to Malta, and I was wretched. I will pass over my
wretchedness, which might not be interesting to you, Miss Villars, and
I will only say that, night after night, my pillow was wet with tears,
and that, but for Louisa’s sympathy, I should have broken my heart.
Frederick and I corresponded regularly under cover of Louisa, and that
was my only comfort.

“By-and-by, however, the time for my leaving school came—partly because
I was seventeen years of age, and partly because papa couldn’t settle
Miss Florathorne’s bills—and I went home to the old rambling house in
Berkshire. Here I found everything at sixes and sevens, and poor papa
in dreadfully low spirits. His creditors were all getting horribly
impatient, he had all sorts of writs, and attachments, and judgments,
and contempt of courts, and horrors of that kind, out against him; and
if they could have put him into two prisons at once, I think they would
have done it, for some of them wanted him in Whitecross Street, and
others wanted him in the Queen’s Bench, and it was altogether dreadful.

“Well, papa’s only friend of late years had been a very learned
gentleman, belonging to a grand legal firm in the city, who had managed
all his business matters for him. Now this gentleman had lately died,
and his only son, who had succeeded to a very large fortune upon his
father’s death, was staying with my poor papa when I came home from
school.

“I hope you won’t think me conceited, Miss Villars, but in order to
make my story intelligible, I’m _obliged_ to say that at that time I
was considered a very pretty girl. I had been the belle of the school
at Miss Florathorne’s, and when I went back to Berkshire and mixed
in society, people made a tremendous fuss about me. Of course, you
know, my dear, troubles about money matters, and a wandering life, and
French dinners, which are too much for a weak digestion, have made a
very great difference in me, and I’m not a bit like what I was then.
Well, the young lawyer who was staying with papa—I shall not tell you
his name, because I consider it very dishonourable to tell the name
of a person you’ve jilted, even to a stranger—was very attentive.
However, I took no notice of that—though he was very handsome and
elegant-looking, and awfully clever—for my heart was true to Frederick,
from whom I received the most heart-rending letters under cover to
Louisa, declaring that, what with the mosquitoes and what with the
separation from me, and owing debts of honour to his brother officers,
and not clearly seeing his way to pay them, he was often on the verge
of committing suicide.

“I had not told papa of my engagement, you must know, my dear, because
I felt sure he’d grumble about my engaging myself to a penniless
ensign; though Fred might have been a marquis, for at that time there
were only eleven cousins between him and the title. So one day papa
took me out for a drive with him, while Mr.——while the young lawyer
was out shooting; and he told me that he was sure, from several things
the young lawyer had let drop, that he was desperately in love with
me, and that it would be his salvation—pa’s—if I would marry him, for
he was sure that in that case the young man, who was very generous and
noble-minded, would pay his debts—pa’s—and then he could go on the
continent and end his days in peace.

“Well, my dear Miss Villars, the scene between us was actually
heart-rending. I told papa that I loved another—I dared not say that
I was actually engaged to poor dear Frederick—and pa entreated me to
sacrifice what he called a foolish school-girl’s fancy, and to give
some encouragement to a noble-hearted young man, who would no doubt get
him out of the most abominable trouble, and would make me an excellent
husband.”

“And you consented?”

“Yes, my dear, after a great deal of persuasion, and after shedding
actual oceans of tears, and in compliance with papa’s entreaties, I
began to give the young lawyer—I’m obliged to call him the _young_
lawyer, because one is so apt to associate lawyers with grey hair, and
grumpiness, and blue bags—a little encouragement, and in about a week’s
time he made me an offer, and I accepted it, though my heart was still
true to Frederick, and I was still corresponding with him under cover
of Louisa.”

Eleanor looked very grave at this part of the story, and Mrs. Lennard
interpreted her companion’s serious face as a mute reproach.

“Yes, I know it was very wrong,” she exclaimed; “but then, what in
goodness’ name was I to do, driven to distraction upon one side by pa,
driven to distraction upon the other side by Fred, who vowed that he
would blow out his brains if I didn’t write to him by every mail?

“Well, my dear, the young lawyer, whom I shall call in future my
affianced husband, for short, behaved most nobly. In the first place
he bought pa’s estate—not that he wanted it, but because pa wanted the
money—and then he lent pa enough money, over and above the price of the
estate, to settle with all his creditors, and to buy an annuity, upon
which he could live very comfortably abroad. Of course this was very
generous of him, and he made quite light of it, declaring that my love
would have repaid him for much greater sacrifices. You know he thought
I loved him, and I really did try to love him, and to throw over poor
Frederick, for papa’s sake: but the more I tried to throw Frederick
over, and the more distant and cold I made my letters, the more
heart-rending he became, reminding me of the vows I had uttered in the
garden at Bath, and declaring that if I jilted him, his blood should be
upon my head. So, what with one thing and another, my life was a burden.

“It took papa some time to settle all his debts, even with the
assistance of my affianced husband, but at last everything was
arranged, and we started for a continental tour. My affianced husband
accompanied us, and the marriage was arranged to take place at
Lausanne. I need not say that I was very unhappy all this time; and I
felt that I was a very wicked creature, for I was deceiving one of the
best of men. Perhaps the worst of all was, that my affianced husband
had such perfect confidence in me, that I scarcely think anything I
could have said or done—short of what I did at the very last—could have
shaken his faith. He talked sometimes of my youth, and my childishness,
and my simplicity, until I used to feel a perfect LUCRETIA BORGIA.
Ah! Miss Villars, it was dreadful, and I often felt inclined to throw
myself at his feet and tell him all about poor Frederick; but the
thought of my poor papa, and the recollection of the money for the
estate, which could not be paid back again, sealed my lips, and I went
on day after day deceiving the best of men. You see, I’d gone too far
to recede, and oh, my dear, that is the awful penalty one always pays
for one’s wickedness—if you begin by deceiving any one, you’re obliged
to go on, and on, and on, from one deception to another, until you feel
the basest creature in the world.

“At least that’s how I felt when all the lovely dresses, and jewels,
and things that my affianced husband had ordered arrived from Paris. If
I could have walked upon gold, Miss Villars, I do think that foolish
man—for he was quite foolish about me, though in a general way he was
so very clever—would have thought the purest bullion only fit for
paving stones under my feet. The silks and satins—satin wasn’t _outré_
then, you know—would have stood alone if one had wanted them to do
so; the lace—well, I won’t dwell upon that, because I dare say you
think already that I shall never have done talking, and are getting
dreadfully tired of this long story.”

“No, Mrs. Lennard,” Eleanor answered, gravely, “I am very much
interested in your story. You cannot tell how deeply it interests me.”

The major’s wife was only too glad to receive permission to run on. She
was one of those people who are never happier than when reciting their
own memoirs, or relating remarkable passages in the history of their
lives.

“The very eve of the wedding-day had arrived,” resumed Mrs. Lennard, in
a very solemn, and, indeed, almost awful voice, “when the unlooked-for
crisis of my destiny came upon me like a thunderbolt. Pa and my
affianced husband had gone out together, and I was alone in one of the
apartments which we occupied at Lausanne. It was about an hour before
dinner, and I was dressed in one of the silks that had come from Paris,
and I was tolerably resigned to my fate, and determined to do my best
to make my affianced husband happy, and to prove my gratitude for his
goodness to my father. Imagine my horror, then, when I was told that a
lady wished to see me—an English lady—and before I could decide whether
I was at home or not, in rushed Louisa Lennard, very dusty and tumbled,
for she had only just arrived, and of course there was no railway to
Lausanne from anywhere, at that time.

“Well, my dear Miss Villars, it seems that Frederick’s silence, which
I had taken for resignation, was quite the reverse. Louisa had heard
of my intended marriage, and had written about it to her brother, and
her brother had gone nearly mad, and, being on the eve of obtaining
leave of absence on account of his bad health—the climate had knocked
him up—contrived to get away from Malta immediately. He and his sister
had managed to persuade their rich maiden aunt, who was very fond of
Frederick, and who left him all her money the other day, to take them
both to Switzerland, and there they were, with the rich maiden aunt,
who was very much knocked up by the journey, and who had not the least
shadow of a suspicion that she had been made a catspaw.

“Well, Miss Villars, anybody—even the hardest-hearted of
creatures—would have been touched by such devotion as this, and for
the moment I forgot all about my affianced husband’s generosity, and
I gave that enthusiastic Louisa, who really was the moving spirit of
everything, a solemn promise that I would see Frederick that night, if
only for ten minutes. Of course I didn’t tell her that the next day was
appointed for my wedding, because I was too much afraid of her anger,
as she was devotedly attached to her brother, and had heard my solemn
vows in the garden at Bath; but the people at the hotel told her all
about it, in their nasty gossiping way; the consequence of which was,
that when I met Fred in the porch of the cathedral, while papa and my
affianced husband were taking their wine after dinner, his goings-on
were really awful.

“I can never describe that scene. When I look back at it, it seems
like a dream—all hurry, and noise, and confusion. Frederick declared
that he had come all the way from Malta to claim me as his bride, and
called my affianced husband a baron all covered with jewels and gold,
from the ballad of ‘Alonzo the Brave,’ which he had been in the habit
of reciting at school And, poor dear fellow, now that I saw him again,
my heart, which had always been true to him, seemed more true to him
than ever; and what with Louisa, who was very strong-minded, going on
at me, and calling me mercenary and faithless and deceitful, and what
with Frederick going down upon his knees in that chilly porch, and
getting up suddenly every time the person who showed the cathedral to
strangers happened to look our way, I scarcely knew what I said or did,
and Frederick extorted from me the promise that I would run away with
him and Louisa that very night, and be married to him as soon as ever
we could find anybody that would marry us.

“I can never describe that dreadful night, Miss Villars; suffice it
to say, that I ran away without a bit of luggage, and that Frederick,
Louisa, and I, performed the most awful journey—almost all by
diligence—and were nearly jolted to death between Lausanne and Paris,
where Fred, by the help of some English friends, contrived to get the
ceremony performed by a Protestant clergyman, at the house of the
British Consul, but not without a great deal of difficulty and delay,
during which I expected every day that my affianced husband would come
tearing after me.

“He did nothing of the kind, however. I heard afterwards from papa that
he didn’t show the least disposition to pursue me, and he particularly
requested that no attempt should be made to prevent my doing exactly
as I pleased with regard to Fred. If he had pursued me, Miss Villars,
I have no doubt I should have gone back and married him; for I am very
weak, and it is my nature to do whatever people wish me to do. But
all he did was to walk about very quietly, looking as pale as a ghost
for a day or two, and braving out all the ridicule that attached to
him because of his bride’s running away from him upon the eve of the
wedding-day, and then he parted company with papa, and went away to
Egypt, and went up the Nile, and did all sorts of outlandish things.”

“And have you never seen him since?” Eleanor asked; anxiously.

“Yes, once,” answered Mrs. Lennard, “and that’s the most singular part
of the story. About three years after my marriage I was in London, and
Fred and I were very, very poor, for his aunt hadn’t then forgiven him
for making a catspaw of her at Lausanne, and he had no remittances from
her, and nothing but his pay and an occasional present from Louisa,
who married a rich city man soon after our elopement. I had had one
baby, a little girl, who was then a year and a half old, and who was
christened after Fred’s rich aunt; and Fred’s regiment was ordered out
to India, and I was getting ready to join him at Southampton, and I was
very unhappy at having to take my darling out there, for people said
the climate would kill her. I was in lodgings in the neighbourhood of
Euston Square, and I was altogether very wretched, when one evening, at
dusk, as I was sitting by the fire, with my little girl in my lap, who
should walk into the room but the very man I had jilted.

“I gave a scream when I saw him, but he begged me not to be frightened
of him; and then I asked him if he had forgiven me. He said he had
tried to forgive me. He was very grave and quiet; but though I think
he tried to be gentle, there was a sort of suppressed sternness in his
manner which made me feel afraid of him. He had not very long returned
from the East, he said, and he was very lonely and wretched. He had
heard from my father that I was going to India, and that I had a little
girl, whom I was obliged to take abroad with me for want of the means
of providing her with a comfortable home in England. He proposed to me
to adopt this little girl, and to bring her up as his own daughter,
with my husband’s consent.

“He promised to leave her very well off at his death, and to give her
a fortune if he lived to see her married. He would be most likely,
he said, to leave her all his money; but he made it a condition that
neither I nor her father should have any further claim upon her. We
were to give her up altogether, and were to be satisfied with hearing
of her from time to time, through him.

“‘I am a lonely man, Mrs. Lennard,’ he said; ‘even my wealth is a
burden to me. My life is purposeless and empty. I have no incentive to
labour—nothing to love or to protect. Let me have your little girl; I
shall be a better father to her than your husband can be.’

“At first I thought that I could never, never consent to such a thing;
but little by little he won me over, in a grave, persuasive way, that
convinced me in spite of myself, and I couldn’t afford to engage a
nurse to go out to Calcutta with me, and I’d advertised for an ayah who
wanted to return, and who would go with me for the consideration of
her passage-money, but there had been no answers to my advertisements:
so at last I consented to write to Fred to ask him if he would agree
to our parting with the pet. Fred wrote me the shortest of letters by
return of post; ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘the child would be an awful nuisance
on shipboard, and it will be much better for her to stop in England.’ I
sent his letter to the lawyer, and the next day he brought a nurse, a
respectable elderly person, and fetched away my precious darling.

“You see, Miss Villars, neither Fred nor I had _realized_ the idea that
we were parting with her for ever; we only thought of the convenience
of getting her a happy home in England for nothing, while we went to be
broiled to death’s door out in India. But! ah! when years and years
passed by, and the two babies who were born in India died, I began to
grieve dreadfully about my lost pet; and if I hadn’t been what some
people call frivolous, and if Fred and I hadn’t suited each other so
exactly, and been somehow or other always happy together in all our
troubles, I think I should have broken my heart. But I tried to be
resigned,” concluded Mrs. Lennard, with a profound sigh, “and I hear
_of_ my pet once in six months or so, though I never hear from her, and
indeed I doubt if she knows she’s got such a thing as a mamma in the
universe—and I have her portrait, poor darling, and she’s very like
what I was twenty years ago.”

“I know she is,” Eleanor answered, gravely.

“You know she is! You know her, then?”

“Yes, dear Mrs. Lennard. Very strange things happen in this world, and
not the least strange is the circumstance which has brought you and me
together. I know your daughter intimately. Her name is Laura, is it
not?”

“Yes, Laura Mason Lennard, after Fred’s rich aunt, Laura Mason.”

“And your maiden name was Margaret Ravenshaw.”

“Good gracious me, yes!” cried Mrs. Lennard. “Why, you seem to know
everything about me.”

“I know this much,—the man you jilted was Gilbert Monckton, of Tolldale
Priory.”

“Of course! Tolldale was poor papa’s place till he sold it to Mr.
Monckton. Oh, Miss Villars, if you know him, how you must despise me!”

“I only wonder that you could——”

Eleanor stopped abruptly; the termination of her speech would not
have been very complimentary to the good-tempered major. Mrs. Lennard
understood that sudden pause.

“I know what you were going to say, Miss Villars. You were going to say
you wondered how I could prefer Fred to Gilbert Monckton; and I’m not a
bit offended. I know as well as you do that Mr. Monckton is very, VERY,
VERY superior to Frederick in intellect, and dignity, and elegance, and
all manner of things. But then, you see,” added Mrs. Lennard, with a
pleading smile, “Fred _suited me_.”




CHAPTER LIV.

VERY LONELY.


Eleanor had considerable difficulty in parrying Mrs. Lennard’s
questions as to how she had come to know Gilbert Monckton and his ward;
and she was obliged to confess that she had been musical governess to
Laura at Hazlewood.

“But I must beg you not to tell Mr. Monckton that I am with you, if you
should happen to write to him,” Eleanor said. “I have a very particular
reason for wishing him to remain in perfect ignorance of my present
home.”

“To be sure, my dear,” answered Mrs. Lennard, “of course I won’t tell
him if you don’t wish me to do so. And as to writing to him, I should
no more think of doing so than of flying in the air, except just a
civil note of a few lines, to thank him for sending me news of Laura.
He only writes to me once in six months or so, to tell me how my lost
darling is, and though I’ve implored him again and again, he won’t let
me see her. ‘She is still little more than a child,’ he wrote in his
last letter, ‘and I dread the effect of your influence upon her. It is
out of no revengeful feeling that I keep your daughter apart from you.
When her character is formed and her principles fixed, you shall know
her.’ As if I was a wretch!” cried Mrs. Lennard, in conclusion, “and
should contaminate my own daughter.”

Eleanor smiled as she shook her head.

“Dear Mrs. Lennard,” she said, “your daughter is perhaps better off in
the care of such a man as Gilbert Monckton. She is as kind-hearted and
good-tempered as yourself, but she is rather weak, and——”

“And I’m weak, too. Yes, I quite understand you, Miss Villars. It is my
misfortune to be weak-minded. I can’t say ‘no’ to people. The arguments
of the person who talks to me last always seem so much stronger
than those of the person who talked to me first. I take impressions
quickly, and don’t take them deeply. I was touched to the heart by
Gilbert Monckton’s kindness to my father, and I meant to marry him as I
promised, and to be his true and obedient wife; and then when that poor
silly Fred came all the way to Lausanne, and went on so about being
ill-used and deserted, and wanted to commit suicide, I thought it was
my duty to run away with Fred. I haven’t any opinions of my own, you
see, and I’m always ready to be influenced by the opinions of other
people.”

Eleanor thought long and deeply over the story she had heard from Mrs.
Lennard. This was the root of all Gilbert Monckton’s suspicions. He
had been deceived, most cruelly, most unexpectedly, by a beautiful,
childish creature, in whose innocence he had implicitly believed. He
had been fooled and hoodwinked by a fair-haired angel whose candid
azure eyes had seemed to beam upon him with all the brightness of
truth. He had been deceived most egregiously, but he had not been
deliberately betrayed: for up to the time of her treacherous desertion
of her affianced lover, Margaret Ravenshaw had meant to be true to him.
Unhappily Gilbert Monckton did not know this. It is difficult for the
man who finds himself as cruelly jilted as he had been, not to believe
that the false one has intended all along to turn traitor at the last.
There had been no explanation between Margaret and the lawyer; and he
was entirely ignorant of the manner of her flight. He only knew that
she had left him without a word to prepare him for the death-blow,
without a line of regretful farewell to make his sorrow lighter to
him. The frivolous shallow woman had been unable to fathom the depth
of the strong man’s love. Margaret Ravenshaw knew there was a very
little of the divine in her own nature, and she had never expected to
inspire the mighty affection of a grand and noble soul. She was able
to understand the love of Frederick Lennard: which was demonstrated by
noisy protestations, and disclosed itself in long schoolboy letters in
which the young man’s doubtful orthography was blistered by his tears.
But she could not understand the intensity of feelings that did not
make themselves visible in any stereotyped fashion.

Unluckily for the harmony of creation, wise men do not always fall in
love wisely. The wisest and the best are apt to be bound captive by
some external charm, which they think must be the outward evidence
of an inward grace; and Gilbert Monckton had loved this frivolous,
capricious girl as truly as if she had been the noblest and greatest of
womankind. So the blow that had fallen upon him was a very heavy one;
and its most fatal effect was to transform a confiding nature into a
suspicious one.

He argued as many men argue under the same circumstances. He had been
deceived by one woman, _ergo_, all women were capable of deception.
I don’t suppose the “Stranger” placed very much confidence in the
Countess, or had by any means too high an opinion of Charlotte; and the
best of men are apt to feel very much after the manner of Mrs. Haller’s
husband.

It seemed very strange to Eleanor to be living with Gilbert Monckton’s
first love. It was almost as if some one had risen out of the grave;
for she had looked upon that old story which she had heard hinted at by
the Hazlewood gossips, as something so entirely belonging to the past,
that the heroine of the romance must of necessity be dead.

And here she was, alive and merry, knowing no greater uneasiness than
a vague dread of increasing plumpness, induced by French dinners. Here
she was the very reverse of the image that Eleanor had conjured up in
her mind in association with Gilbert’s false love; a good-tempered,
commonplace, pretty, middle-aged woman. Mrs. Monckton felt a little
pang of jealousy at the thought that her husband had once loved this
woman so dearly. Her husband! Had she still the right to call him by
that name? Had he not severed the link between them of his own free
will? Had he not outraged her honour, insulted her truth by his base
and unfounded suspicions? Yes! he had done all this, and yet Eleanor
loved him! She knew the strength of her love now that she was away from
him, and might perhaps never see his face looking at her in kindness
again. She knew it now that her scheme of vengeance against Launcelot
Darrell had failed, and left a great blank in her mind. She thought of
her husband seriously now for the first time, and she knew that she
loved him.

“Richard was right,” she thought again and again; “the purpose of my
life was cruel and unwomanly. I had no right to marry Gilbert Monckton
while my mind was full of angry thoughts. Richard was right. My poor
father’s rest would be no more peaceful if I had made Launcelot Darrell
pay the penalty of his wickedness.”

She did not abandon her idea of vengeance all at once; but little by
little, by very slow degrees, her mind became reconciled to the idea
that she had failed in her scheme of retribution, and that there was
nothing left her but to try and justify herself in the sight of the
husband she loved.

She loved him; and the angry feelings which had prompted her to run
away from Tolldale Priory, willingly abandoning all claim to his name
and his protection, were beginning to give way now. Mrs. Lennard’s
story had thrown new light upon the past, and Eleanor made all kinds of
excuses for her husband’s conduct. It was his habit to bear all sorrows
quietly. Who could tell what anguish he might have felt in the thought
of his young wife’s falsehood?

“He would not pursue Margaret Ravenshaw,” Eleanor thought, “and he
makes no attempt to find me. And yet he may love me as truly as he
loved her. Surely if God refused to hear my prayers for revenge, he
will grant me the power to justify myself.”

She could only blindly hope for some unknown chance that might bring
about her justification; and that chance would perhaps never come.
She was very unhappy when she thought of this; and it was only the
perpetual confusion in which Major Lennard and his wife contrived to
keep everybody belonging to them, that saved her from suffering very
cruelly.

All this time she was quite ignorant of the appearance of an
advertisement which had been repeated at the top of the second column
of the _Times_ supplement every day for nearly a month, and about which
idle people hazarded all many of conjectures—

 ELEANOR, come back. I was rash and cruel. I will trust you.

  G. M.

Major Lennard was in the habit of seeing the _Times_ every day at
Galignani’s; but, as he was not a very acute observer or original
thinker, he took no notice of the repetition of this advertisement
beyond an occasional, “By Jove! Haw! that poor dayv’l’s still
advertising for El’ner!” nor did he ever make any allusion to the
circumstance in his domestic circle.

So Eleanor hugged her sorrows secretly in the gayest city of the world,
while Gilbert Monckton was hurrying hither and thither, and breaking
his heart about his lost wife.

I think that pitying angels must sometimes weep over the useless
torments, the unnecessary anguish, which foolish mortals inflict upon
themselves.




CHAPTER LV.

VICTOR BOURDON GOES OVER TO THE ENEMY.


Major and Mrs. Lennard and Eleanor Monckton had stayed for nearly two
months at the Hôtel du Palais. April was fast melting into May, and
the atmosphere in the city of Boulevards was very different to the
air of an English spring. Miniature strawberries were exposed in the
windows of the cheap restaurants in the Palais Royal, side by side with
monstrous asparagus, and green peas from Algeria; until the mind of the
insular-bred stranger grew confused as to the succession of the months,
and was beguiled into thinking that May must be omitted in the French
almanack, and that capricious April skipped away in a farewell shower
to give place at once to glowing June.

It was difficult for a thorough-bred Briton to believe that the Fête
of the First Napoleon had not yet come to set the fountains playing at
Versailles: for the asphalte on the Boulevards was unpleasantly warm
under one’s boots; airily-attired ladies were lounging upon the chairs
in the gardens of the Tuileries; only the most fragile and vaporous
bonnets were to be seen in the Bois de Boulogne; vanille and strawberry
ices were in constant demand at Tortoni’s; idle Parisians spent the
dusky spring evenings seated outside the lighted cafés, drinking iced
lemonade; and a hundred other signs and tokens bore witness that the
summer had come.

Upon one of these very warm April days, Major Lennard insisted upon
taking his wife and her companion to dine at a restaurant not very far
from the Bourse; where the pastorally-inclined epicure could take his
dinner in a garden, a pleasant quadrangle, festooned with gay blossoms,
and musical with the ripple of a fountain. Eleanor did not often
accompany the major and his wife in their pleasure excursions, the
culminating attraction of which was generally a dinner; but this time
Major Lennard insisted upon her joining them.

“It’s the last dinner I shall give, Meg, in Paris,” he said; “for we
must start for Brussels on Saturday, and I mean it to be a good one.”

Eleanor submitted, for her new friends had been very kind to her, and
she had no motive for opposing their wishes. It was much better for
her to be with them in any scene of gaiety, however hollow and false
that gaiety might be, than alone in the splendid saloon at the Hôtel du
Palais, brooding over her troubles in the dusky twilight, and thinking
of the horrible night on which she had watched for her father’s coming
in the Rue de l’Archevêque.

The restaurant near the Place de la Bourse was very much crowded upon
this sunny April afternoon, and there was only one table vacant when
the major and his party entered the flowery little quadrangle, where
the rippling of the fountain was unheard amidst the clattering of
plates and the chinking of silver forks. It was seven o’clock, and the
dinners were in high progress; the diners eating very fast, and talking
a great deal faster.

The little arbour-like box to which Major Lennard conducted the two
ladies was next to a similar arbour, in which there was a group of
Frenchmen. Eleanor sat with her back to these men, who had very nearly
finished dining, and who, from the style of their conversation,
appeared to have taken plenty of wine. The man who was evidently the
entertainer sat with his legs amongst a forest of empty bottles; and
the jingling of glasses and the “cloop” of newly-drawn corks drowned a
good deal of the conversation.

It was not very likely that Eleanor would listen to these men’s talk;
or, indeed, distinguish one voice from another, or one word from
another, amid the noise of the crowded garden. She had quite enough to
do to attend to Mrs. Lennard, who chattered all dinner time, keeping
up an uninterrupted babble, in which remarks upon the business of the
dinner-table were blended with criticisms upon the dress of ladies
sitting in the other boxes.

“You should eat those little red things—baby lobsters—écrivisses, I
think they call them, dear; I always do. How do you like that bonnet;
no, not that one—a little more St. Jacques, major—the black one, with
the peach-coloured strings? I wonder why they call all the Clarets
saints, and not the Burgundies. Do you think she’s pretty in the box
opposite? No, you don’t think much of her, do you?—_I_ don’t—I like the
one in the blue silk, pretty well, if her eyebrows weren’t so heavy.”

The dinner was drawing to a close, the major was up to his eyes in
roast fowl and water-cress, and Mrs. Lennard was scraping the preserved
fruit out of a shellwork of heavy pastry with the point of her spoon,
trifling idly now that the grand business was done, when Eleanor rose
suddenly from her seat, breathless and eager, as much startled by the
sound of a voice in the next arbour as if a shell had just exploded
amidst the débris of the dinner.

“After?” some one had said, interrogatively.

“After,” answered a man whose voice had grown hoarser and thicker,
as the empty bottles about the legs of the president had become more
numerous, “my stripling has refused me a little bank-note of a thousand
francs. Thou art too dear, my friend, he has said to me; _that_ has
been paid already, and enough largely. Besides, _that_ was not great
things. Ah! ha! I said, thou art there, my drôle; you begin to fatigue
yourself of your confederate. He is too much. Very well; he has his
pride, he also. Thou art the last of men, and I say to you, adieu,
Monsieur Launcelot Darrell.”

This was the name that struck upon Eleanor’s ear, and aroused the old
feeling in all its strength. The snake had only been scotched after
all. It reared its head at the sound of that name, like a war-horse at
the blast of a trumpet. Eleanor, starting to her feet, turned round and
faced the party in the next box. The man who had spoken had risen also,
and was leaning across the table to reach a bottle on the other side.
Thus it was that the faces of the two were opposite to each other; and
Victor Bourdon, the commercial traveller, recognized Gilbert Monckton’s
missing wife.

He dropped the glass that he was filling, and poured some wine into the
cuff of his coat, while he stared at Eleanor in drunken surprise.

“You are here, madame?” he cried, with a look in which astonishment was
blended with intense delight, a sort of tipsy radiance that illuminated
the Frenchman’s fat face. Even in the midst of her surprise at seeing
him, Eleanor perceived that blending of expression and wondered at it.

Before she could speak, Monsieur Bourdon had left his party and had
deliberately seated himself in the empty chair next her. He seized her
hand in both his own, and bent over her as she shrank away from him.

“Do not recoil from me, madame,” he said, always speaking in French
that was considerably disguised by wine. “Ah, you do not know. I can
be of the last service to you; and you can be of the last service to
me also. I have embroiled myself with this Monsieur Long—cell—lotte,
for always; after that which I have done for him, he is an ingrate, he
is less than that,” Monsieur Bourdon struck the nail of his thumb upon
his front tooth with a gesture of ineffable contempt. “But why do I
tell you this, madame? You were in the garden when this poor old,—this
Monsieur de Crespigny, was lying dead. You remember; you know. Never
mind, I lose myself the head; I have dined a little generously.
Will you find yourself to-morrow, madame, in the gardens of the
Palais Royal, at five hours? There is music all the Tuesdays. I have
something of the last importance to tell you. Remember you that I know
everything. I know that you hate this Long—cellotte. I will give you
your revenge. You will come; is it not?”

“Yes,” Eleanor answered, quickly.

“Upon the five hours? I shall wait for you near to the fountain.”

“Yes.”

Monsieur Bourdon rose, put on his hat with a drunken flourish, and
went back to his friends. The major and Mrs. Lennard had been all this
time staring aghast at the drunken Frenchman. He had spoken in a loud
whisper to Eleanor, but neither Frederick Lennard nor his wife retained
very much of that French which had been sedulously drilled into them
during their school-days, and beyond ordering a dinner, or disputing
with a landlord as to the unconscionable number of wax-candles in a
month’s hotel bill, their knowledge of the language was very limited;
so Eleanor had only to explain to her friends that Monsieur Bourdon was
a person whom she had known in England, and that he had brought her
some news of importance which she was to hear the following day in the
gardens of the Palais Royal.

Mrs. Lennard, who was the soul of good-nature, readily assented to
accompany Eleanor to this rendezvous.

“Of course I’ll go, my dear, with pleasure; and really I think it’s
quite funny, and indeed actually romantic, to go and meet a tipsy
Frenchman—at least, of course, he won’t be tipsy to-day—near a
fountain; and it reminds me of a French novel I read once in English,
which shows how true it must have been to foreign manners; but as the
major knows we’re going, there’s no harm, you know,” Mrs. Lennard
remarked, as they walked from the Hotel du Palais to the gardens. The
diners were hard at work already at the cheap restaurants, and the
brass band was braying lively melodies amidst the dusty trees and
flowers, the lukewarm fountain, the children, the nursemaids, and the
rather seedy-looking Parisian loungers. It was a quarter past five,
for Mrs. Lennard had mislaid her parasol at the last moment, and there
had been ten minutes employed in skirmish and search. Monsieur Victor
Bourdon was sitting upon a bench near the fountain, but he rose and
darted forward with his hat in his hand as the two ladies approached.

“I’ll go and look in the jewellers’ shops, Miss Villars,” Mrs. Lennard
said, “while you’re talking to your friend; and please come and look
for me when you want me. The major is to join us here, you know, at
half-past six, and we’re to dine at Vèfours’. _Good_ morning.”

Mrs. Leonard bestowed these final words upon the Frenchman, accompanied
by a graceful curtsey, and departed. Victor Bourdon pointed to the
bench which he had just left, and Eleanor sat down. The Frenchman
seated himself next her, but at a respectful distance. Every trace of
the tipsy excitement of the previous night had vanished. He was quite
cool to-day; and there was a certain look of determination about his
mouth, and a cold glitter in his light, greenish-grey eyes that did not
promise well for any one against whom he might bear a grudge.

He spoke English to-day. He spoke it remarkably well, with only an
occasional French locution.

“Madame,” he began, “I shall not waste time, but come at once to the
point. You hate Launcelot Darrell?”

Eleanor hesitated. There is something terrible in that word “hate.”
People entertain the deadly sentiment; but they shrink from its plain
expression. The naked word is too appalling. It is the half-sister of
murder.

“I have good reason to dislike him——” she began.

The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders as he interrupted her.

“Yes, you hate him!” he said; “you do not like to say so, because the
word is not nice. You are—what is it you call it?—you are _shocked_ by
the word. But it is so, nevertheless; you hate him, and you have cause
to hate him. Yes, I know now who you are. I did not know when I first
saw you in Berkshire, but I know now. Launcelot Darrell is one who
cannot keep a secret, and he has told me. You are the daughter of that
poor old man who killed himself in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine—that is
enough! You are a great heart; you would to avenge the death of your
father. You saw us that night—the night the wills were change?”

“I did,” Eleanor answered, looking at the man with sovereign contempt.
He had spoken of the transaction as coolly as if it had been the most
honourable and commonplace business

“You are there in the darkness, and you see us,” exclaimed Monsieur
Bourdon, bending over Eleanor and speaking in a confidential whisper,
“you watch, you look, you listen, and after, when you go into the
house, you denounce Launcelot. You declare the will is forge. The will
is change. You were witness, you say; you tell all that you saw! But
they do not believe you. But why? Because when you say you have the
true will in your pocket, you cannot find it; it is gone.”

The Frenchman said this in a tone of triumph, and then paused suddenly,
looking earnestly at Eleanor.

As she returned that look a new light flashed upon her mind. She began
to understand the mystery of the lost will.

“It is gone,” cried Monsieur Bourdon, “no trace, no vestige of it
remains. You say, search the garden; the garden is search; but no
result. Then the despair seizes itself of you. Launcelot mocks himself
of you; he laughs at your nose. You find yourself unhappy; they do not
believe you; they look coldly at you; they are harsh to you, and you
fly from them. It is like that; is it not?”

“Yes,” Eleanor answered.

Her breath came and went quickly; she never removed her eyes from the
man’s face. She began to think that her justification was perhaps only
to be obtained by the agency of this disreputable Frenchman.

“What, then, of the lost will? It was not swallowed up by the earth. It
could not fly itself away into the space! What became of it?”

“YOU TOOK IT FROM ME!” cried Eleanor. “Yes, I remember how closely you
brushed against me. The paper was too big to go altogether into the
pocket of my dress. The ends were sticking out, and you——”

“I did all my possible to teach you a lesson! Ah, when young and
beautiful ladies mix themselves with such matters, it is no wonder they
make mistakes. I was watching you all the time, dear madame. I saw you
change the papers, and I drew the will out of your pocket, as easily as
I could rob you of that handkerchief.”

The corner of a lace-bordered handkerchief was visible amid the folds
of Eleanor’s dress. The Frenchman took the scrap of lace between his
fingers, and snatched the handkerchief away with an airy lightness of
touch that might have done credit to a professional adept in the art of
picking pockets. He laughed as he returned the handkerchief to Eleanor.
She scarcely noticed the action, so deeply was she absorbed in the
thought of the missing will.

“You have the will, then?”

“Si, madame.”

“Why did you take it from me?”

“But why, madame? For many reasons. First, because it is always good to
seize upon anything that other people do not know how to keep. Again,
because it is always well to have a strong hand, and a card that one’s
adversary does not know of. An extra king in one’s coat-cuff is a good
thing to have when one plays écarté, madame. That will is my extra
king.”

The Frenchman was silent for some little time after having made what he
evidently considered rather a startling _coup_. He sat watching Eleanor
with a sidelong glance, and with a cunning twinkle in his small eyes.

“Is it that we are to be friends and allies, madame?” he asked,
presently.

“Friends!” cried Eleanor. “Do you forget who I am? Do you forget whose
daughter I am? If Launcelot Darrell’s was the only name written in
my father’s last letter, you were not the less an accomplice in the
villany that led to his death. The pupil was no doubt worthy of the
master.”

“You reject my friendship, then, madame? You wish to know nothing of
the document that is in my possession? You treat me from high to low?
You refuse to ally yourself with me? Hein?”

“I will use you as an instrument against Launcelot Darrell, if you
please,” Eleanor answered, “since it seems that you have quarrelled
with your fast friend.”

“But yes, madame. When pussy has pulled the chestnuts out of the fire,
she is thenceforward the most unuseful of animals, and they chase
her. Do you understand, madame?” cried the Frenchman, with a sudden
transformation from the monkey to the tiger phase of his character,
that was scarcely agreeable. “Do you understand?” he hissed. “Monsieur
Launcelot has ennuied himself of me. I am chased! ME!”

He struck his gloved fingers upon his breast to give emphasis to this
last word.

“It is of the last _canaille_, this young man,” he continued, with a
shrug of disgust. “Ingrate, poltroon, scoundrel! When the forge will,
forge at my suggestion by the clerk of the avoué de Vindsor, has been
read, and all is finish, and no one dispute his possession, and he
enter his new domain as master, the real nature of the man reveal
itself. The _genuine_ will is burn, he think. He defies himself of his
dear friend, this poor Bourdon, and he will not even tell him who would
have benefit by that genuine will. It is burn! Did he not see it scorch
and blaze with his own eyes? There is nothing to fear; and for this
poor comrade, who has helped my gentleman to a great fortune he is less
than that!”

Monsieur Bourdon snapped his fingers derisively, and stared fiercely at
Eleanor. Then he relapsed into a sardonic smile, and went on.

“At first things go on charmingly. Monsieur Launcelot is more sweet
than the honey. It is new to him to be rich, and for the first month
he scatters his money with full hands. Then suddenly he stops. He
cries out that he is on the road to ruin; that his friend’s claims are
monstrous. Faith of a gentleman, I was, perhaps, extravagant; for I am
a little gamester, and I like to see life _en grand seigneur. A bas la
moutarde_, I said. My friend is _millionnaire_. I am no more commercial
traveller. Imagine, then, when mon garçon shuts up his—what is it you
call it, then—cheque-book, and refuse me a paltry sum of a thousand
francs. I smile in his face,” said Monsieur Bourdon, nodding his
head slowly, with half-closed eyes, “and I say, ‘Bon jour, Monsieur
Darrell; I shall make you hear some news of me before I am much older.’”

“You did not tell him that the will was in your possession?”

“A thousand thunders! No!” exclaimed the Frenchman. “I was not so much
foolish as to show him the beneath the cards. I come over here to
consult a friend, an avoué.”

“And he tells you——?”

“No matter. You are better than the avoué, madame. You hate Launcelot
Darrell; this will is all you want to prove him a cheat and a
blacksmith—pardon, a forger.”

“But to whom does Mr. de Crespigny leave his estate in this genuine
will?” asked Mrs. Monckton.

The Frenchman smiled, and looked at Eleanor thoughtfully for a few
moments before he answered her.

“Wait a little, madame,” he said; “that is my little secret. Nothing
for nothing is the rule here below. I have told you too much already.
If you want to know more you must pay me.”

“Prove that I spoke the truth upon that night,” exclaimed Eleanor,
“and I promise you that my husband, Gilbert Monckton, shall reward you
handsomely.”

“But if monsieur should repudiate your promise, madame, since he has
not authorized you to give it? I am not very wise in your English law,
and I would rather not mix myself in this affair. I do not want to be
produced as witness or accomplice. I want, all simply, to get a price
for this document. I have something to sell. You wish to buy it. Name
your price.”

“I cannot,” answered Eleanor; “I have no money. But I might get some,
perhaps. Tell me, how much do you want?”

“A thousand pounds.”

Eleanor shook her head despondently.

“Impossible!” she said; “there is no one, except my husband, from whom
I could get such an amount, and I could not ask him for money until
after I had proved Launcelot Darrell’s infamy.”

The Frenchman watched her closely. He saw that she had spoken the truth.

“You do not know how much this will is worth to you, madame,” he
said. “Remember, I could make terms with Launcelot Darrell, and sell
it to him for perhaps ten times the sum I ask of you. But Monsieur
Darrell was insolent to me; he struck me once with the butt end of his
hunting-whip; I do not forget. I could get more money from him; but I
can get my revenge through you.”

He hissed out these words between his teeth and glared vindictively at
the fountain, as if the phantom of Launcelot Darrell had been looking
at him out of the sparkling water-drops. Revenge was not a beautiful
thing, as represented by Victor Bourdon. Perhaps Eleanor may have
thought of this as she looked at him.

“I want my revenge,” he repeated; “after all, gold is a villain thing.
Revenge is more dear—to gentlemen. Besides, I do not think you would
pay me ungenerously if I helped you to crush this scoundrel, and helped
you to something else by the market, Hein?”

“I tell you again that you shall be well rewarded,” Mrs. Monckton said,
gravely.

“Very well, then, listen to me. It is to-day Tuesday. In a week I shall
have time to think. In a week you will have leisure to gather together
a little money—all you can get. At the end of that time come to me at
my apartment—bring with you any friend you like. I do not think that
you are traitor—or ingrate—and you see I trust you. I will have my
friend, the—what you call him—attorney, with me—and we may come to an
arrangement. You shall sign a contract—well ruled—for to pay me in
the future, and then the will is to you. You return to England; you
say, ‘Aha, Monsieur Launcelot, walk out of that. It is your turn to be
chased.’”

Victor Bourdon grinned ferociously, then took a memorandum-book from
his pocket, wrote a few words in pencil, tore out the leaf upon which
they were written, and handed it to Mrs. Monckton.

“That is my address,” he said. “On Tuesday, at seven o’clock in the
evening, I shall expect to see you there, and your friend. But if you
think to betray me, remember I am not the man to forgive an injury. I
have the honour to salute you, madame. Bon jour.”

He took off his hat with a flourish, and walked away. Eleanor sat for
some minutes where he had left her, thinking over what had happened,
before she went into the arcades to look for Mrs. Lennard.

That night she told the Lennards who she was, and all her story. She
felt that it was better to do so. She must have freedom now to act, and
to act promptly. She could not do this, and yet preserve her secret.
Her old ally, Richard Thornton, would be indispensable to her in this
crisis, and she wrote to him early on the morning after her interview
with Monsieur Bourdon, imploring him to come to her immediately.




CHAPTER LVI.

THE HORRORS OF DELIRIUM TREMENS.


No letter came from Richard Thornton. Eleanor was seized with a kind of
panic as the days went by, and there was no answer from the young man,
the faithful friend, without whose help she felt herself so powerless.

Eleanor had addressed her letter to the Pilasters, enclosed in an
envelope directed to Signora Picirillo, with a few hurried lines
requesting that it might be immediately forwarded to the scene-painter.
He was in Scotland still, very likely, and some days must elapse before
he could respond to Eleanor’s summons. She felt assured that he would
come to her. There are some friends whose goodness we no more doubt
than we doubt the power of God; and Richard Thornton was one of these.

But the week passed, and no reply came to Eleanor’s appeal for help;
so she began to feel that she stood alone, and must act for herself.
She must act for herself, since to think of getting any assistance
from either the major or his wife in this business, which demanded
foresight, coolness, and diplomacy, would have been about as reasonable
as to apply to one of the children playing under the trees in the
gardens of the Tuileries.

As far as sympathy went, Major and Mrs. Lennard were all that the most
exacting individual could require. The major offered to do anything
in a muscular way on behalf of his wife’s friend. Should he punch the
head of that scoundrelly Frenchman? Should he go over to England and
horsewhip Launcelot Darrell, and bring Gilbert Monckton to reason, and
play up old gooseberry altogether? This good-natured Hercules was ready
to hit out right and left in the defence of poor Eleanor.

But the one friend whom Mrs. Monckton wanted in this crisis was Richard
Thornton. Richard, the clear-sighted, even-tempered, unprejudiced
young man, who was ready to go through fire and water for the sake of
his beautiful adopted sister, without noise or bluster; and when the
Tuesday, the day appointed by the Frenchman for Eleanor’s visit to his
apartments, came, and Richard Thornton did not come with it, the lonely
girl almost gave way to despair.

She felt that she had to encounter a wretch who was utterly without
honour or honesty, and who, seeing the value which she set upon the
possession of Maurice de Crespigny’s will, would be all the more
exacting in his demands. And she had nothing to bribe him with; nothing.

She had been too proud to appeal to her husband. For ever impulsive,
for ever inconsiderate, she had not stopped to think that he of all
others was the most fitting person to stand by her in this crisis. At
first the thought of writing to Gilbert Monckton had indeed flashed
across her mind, but in the next moment she had remembered the bitter
humiliation of her last failure.

She could not endure another such degradation; and she had seen
treachery and dishonour so long triumph over the simple force of
truth, that she had began to think that wrong was stronger than right,
and always must be victorious.

“It I were to write and ask Gilbert to come to me, this Frenchman would
perhaps disappear before my husband could arrive; or he would be afraid
of Gilbert, very likely, and would deny any knowledge of the will, and
I should appear a convicted trickster, who had heaped up one falsehood
upon another, in the weak attempt to justify herself. No, Gilbert
Monckton shall hear nothing of me until I can go to him with Maurice de
Crespigny’s will in my hands.”

But in the meantime this helpless girl’s anxiety grew every hour more
intense. What reliance could she place upon the words of the Frenchman?
She had encountered him while he was still smarting under the sense
of his wrongs, and in that stage of his feelings, revenge had seemed
even sweeter to him than gain. But this state of things might not
endure very long. The commercial traveller might listen to the dictates
of reason rather than to the fiery promptings of passion, and might
begin to think that a substantial recompense in the shape of money was
better than any sugar-plum in the way of revenge. He had said that
Launcelot Darrell would be willing to give him ten times a thousand
pounds for the genuine will. What more likely than that Monsieur Victor
Bourdon should have thought better of his original design, and opened
negotiations with the new master of Woodlands?

Monsieur Bourdon would in all probability have done precisely this,
had he not been hindered by one of those unlooked-for and purely
providential circumstances which so often help single and simple-minded
Truth in her encounters with versatile and shifty Falsehood.

At half-past six o’clock upon the appointed evening, Eleanor Monckton
left the Hôtel du Palais, escorted by Major Lennard, on her way to the
Frenchman’s lodging. She had waited until the last moment in the hope
of Richard Thornton’s arrival, but he had not come; and she had been
fain to accept the aid of this good-natured overgrown schoolboy, who
still persisted that the immediate punching of Victor Bourdon’s head
would be the best and surest means of getting possession of the will.

“Let me punch the feller’s head, Miss Vil—beg pardon, Mrs. Monckton.
The idea of your being married to old Monckton! He ain’t any older than
me, you know; but I always call him old Monckton. Let me punch this
damn Frenchman’s head; that’ll bring the feller to book in next to no
time, and then we can do what we like with him.”

But Eleanor impressed upon her stalwart protector that there must be no
muscular demonstration, and that the conduct of the interview was to be
left entirely to her.

“I don’t in the least hope that he’ll give up the will without a
bribe,” Eleanor said; “he is the last man upon earth to do that.”

“I’ll tell you what, then, Mrs. Monckton,” exclaimed the major; “I
haven’t any _ready_ money; I never had, since I borrowed sixpences of
a sucking bill-discounter at the first school I ever went to; but I’ll
give you my acceptance. Let this fellow draw upon me for a thousand at
three months, and give up the document for that consideration. Monckton
will enable me to meet the bill, no doubt, when he finds I was of
service to you in this business.”

Eleanor looked at the major with a gleam of hope in her face. But
that transient gleam very quickly faded. She had only a vague idea of
the nature and properties of accommodation bills; but she had a very
positive notion of Victor Bourdon’s character, and, though this plan
_sounded_ feasible enough, she did not think it would succeed.

“You are very good to me, Major Lennard,” she said, “and believe me,
I appreciate your kindness; but I do not think that this Frenchman
will consent to take anything but ready money. He could get that from
Launcelot Darrell, remember, at any time.”

Eleanor’s only hope was the one chance that she might induce Victor
Bourdon to accept her promise of a reward from Gilbert Monckton _after_
the production of the will.

The neighbourhood in which the commercial traveller lived, whenever he
made Paris his head-quarters, was one of the dingiest localities in
the city. Major Lennard and Eleanor, after making numerous inquiries,
and twice losing their way, found themselves at last in a long narrow
street, one side of which was chiefly dead-wall, broken here and
there by a dilapidated gateway or a dingy window. At one corner there
was a shop for the sale of unredeemed pledges; a queer old shop, in
whose one murky window obsolete scraps of jewellery, old watch-keys,
impossible watches with cracked enamel dials and crippled hands that
pointed to hours whose last moments had passed away for half a century;
mysterious, incomprehensible garments, whose fashion was forgotten,
and whose first owners were dead and gone; poor broken-down clocks, in
tawdry ormolu cases, that had stood upon lodging-house mantelpieces,
indifferently telling the wrong time to generations of lodgers; an old
guitar; a stringless violin; poor, frail, cracked cups and saucers,
that had been precious once, by reason of the lips that had drunk out
of them; a child’s embroidered frock; a battered christening cup; a
tattered missal; an odd volume of “The Wandering Jew;” amid a hundred
other pitiful relics which poverty barters for a crust of bread, faded
in the evening sunlight, and waited for some eccentric purchaser to
take a fancy to them. Next door to this sarcophagus of the past, there
was an eating-house, neat and almost cheerful, where one could have a
soup, three courses, and half a bottle of wine for fivepence. The whole
neighbourhood seemed to be, somehow or other, overshadowed by churches,
and pervaded by the perpetual tramp of funerals; and, lying low and out
of the way of all cheerful traffic, was apt to have a depressing effect
upon the spirits of frivolous people.

Eleanor, leading the major—who was of about as much use to her as
a blind man is to his dog—succeeded at last in finding the house
which boasted Monsieur Victor Bourdon amongst its inhabitants. I
say “amongst” advisedly; for as there was the office of a popular
bi-weekly periodical upon the first floor, a greengrocer in the
_rez-de-chaussée_, a hairdresser, who professed to cut and friz the
hair, on the second story, and a mysterious lady, whose calling was
represented by a faded pictorial board, resident somewhere under the
roof, the commercial traveller was a very unimportant inhabitant, an
insignificant nomad, replaced to-day by a student _en droit_, to-morrow
by a second-rate actor at a fifth-rate theatre.

Eleanor found this when she came to make inquiries of the portress
as to the possibility of seeing Monsieur Bourdon. This lady, who was
knitting, and whose very matronly contour made it impossible for her
to see her knitting-needles, told Eleanor that Monsieur Bourdon was
very unlikely to be at home at that time. He was apt to return late at
night, upon the two hours, in effect, between two wines, and at those
times he was enough abrupt, and was evidently by no means a favourite
with madame the portress. But on looking into a dusky corner where
some keys were hanging upon a row of rusty nails, madame informed
Eleanor that Monsieur Bourdon _was_ at home, as his key was not amongst
the rest, and it was his habit to leave it in her care when he went
out. The portress seemed very much struck by this discovery, for she
remarked that the last time she had seen Monsieur Bourdon go out had
been early in the morning of Sunday, and that she did not remember
having seen him reenter.

But upon this a brisk young person of twelve or thirteen, who was busy
getting up fine linen in the recesses of the lodge, cried out in a
very shrill voice that Monsieur Bourdon had returned before mid-day on
Sunday, looking a little ill, and dragging himself with a fatigued air.

He was at home, then, the portress exclaimed; at least she did not
utter any equivalent to our English word home, and in that evinced
considerable wisdom, since a French lodging is a place so utterly
unhomelike, that the meanest second-floor at Islington or Chelsea,
presided over by the most unconscionable of British landladies, becomes
better than all the pleasures and palaces we can roam amidst—and it
is not everybody who has the chance of roaming amidst pleasures and
palaces—by the very force of comparison. Monsieur was _chez lui_, the
portress said, and would madame ascend? Monsieur’s apartment was on the
entresol, with windows giving upon the street. Madame would see a black
door facing her upon the first landing.

Eleanor went up a short flight of steps, followed by the major. She
knocked upon the panel of the black door—once, twice, three times; but
there was no answer.

“I’d lay a fiver the feller’s gone out again,” the major exclaimed;
“that jabbering Frenchwoman didn’t seem to know what she was talking
about.”

But Eleanor knocked a fourth time, and very much louder than she had
knocked before. There was no answer even this time; but a voice was
heard within, blaspheming aloud with horrible French execrations that
seemed to freeze Eleanor’s blood as she listened to them.

She did listen to them involuntarily, as people often listen in a
crowded thoroughfare to the obnoxious clamour of a drunken man,
paralyzed for the moment by the horror of his hideous oaths.

Eleanor turned very pale, and looked despairingly at the major.

“Hark!” she whispered; “he is quarrelling with some one.”

The big soldier deliberately turned himself into a convenient position
for listening, and flattened his ear against the keyhole.

“No, he ain’t quarrellin’ with any one,” the major said, presently. “I
can’t make much out of his lingo, but there’s only one voice. He’s all
alone, and goin’ on like a madman.”

The major opened the door softly as he spoke. Monsieur Bourdon’s
apartment was divided into two low-roofed chambers, a little larger
than comfortable pigeon-holes; and in the inner and smaller chamber
Eleanor and her companion saw the commercial traveller wandering
backwards and forwards in his obscure den, only dressed in his trousers
and shirt, and gesticulating like a madman.

Mrs. Monckton clung to the soldier’s arm. She had some cause for fear,
for in the next moment the Frenchman descried his visitors, and, with a
howl of rage, rushed at the major’s throat.

The most intellectual and diplomatic individual in Christendom would
have been of very little service to Eleanor at that moment, if he had
been also a coward. Major Lennard lifted the commercial traveller in
his arms, as easily as if that gentleman had been a six months’ old
baby, carried him into the next room, where there was a narrow little
bedstead, flung him on to the mattress, and held him there.

“You’ll find a silk handkerchief in my pocket, my dear,” he said
to Eleanor, “if you’ll be so kind as to pull it out. Voulez-vous
gardez-vous trangkeel, dong, vous—scoundrel!” he exclaimed, addressing
himself to the struggling Frenchman.

Mrs. Monckton obeyed. She fell into her place quite naturally, giving
way before the major. He was the hero of the moment. Frédéric Soulié
has said that the meanest actor who ever trod the boards of a theatre,
has some inspired moment in which he is great. I fancy it must be
pretty much the same in the drama of life. This was the major’s moment;
and he arose out of his normal inanity, resplendent with unconscious
grandeur.

The silk handkerchief was a large one, and Major Lennard used it very
dexterously about Monsieur Bourdon’s wrists; then he found another
handkerchief in another pocket, and used it as a bandage for the
Frenchman’s ankles; and having done this he sat down by the bedside and
contemplated his handiwork complacently, puffing and blowing a little
while he did so.

Victor Bourdon lay very still, glaring at the ponderous soldier with
eyes that were like those of a wild beast.

“I know thee,” he exclaimed; “thou hast been with me all the night,
thou hast sat upon my chest; ah, Grêdin! thou art the biggest of all
the demons that torment me. Thou breathest the fire and the sulphur,
and thy breath burns me, and now thou hast attached my hands with bands
of iron, white hot, and thou hast tied my ankles with living scorpions!”

Eleanor stood at a few paces from the bed, listening with horror to the
man’s delirious ravings.

“What is it?” she asked, in a subdued voice. “Is it a fever that makes
him like this. Or has he gone mad?”

The major shook his head.

“I think I can guess pretty well what’s the matter with the poor
devil,” he said: “he’s been going it a little too fast. He’s got a
touch of del. trem.”

“Del. trem.!”

“Delirium tremens, my dear,” answered the major. “Yes, you can hear
his teeth chattering now this minute. I had it once when I was up the
country, and our fellers took to living upon brandy pawnee. I had
rather a sharp time of it, while it lasted; used to fancy the tent was
on fire; wanted to go out tiger-hunting in the middle of the night;
tried to set the bed-clothes alight to cure myself of the hiccough: and
ran after Meg with a razor early one morning. This man has got a touch
of it, Mrs. Monckton, and I don’t think we shall get much reason out of
him to-night.”

The conduct of Monsieur Victor Bourdon, who was at that moment holding
a very animated discourse with a dozen or so of juvenile demons
supposed to be located in the bed-curtains, went very far towards
confirming the major’s assertion.

Eleanor sat down at the little table, upon which the dirty litter of
the Frenchman’s last meal was huddled into a heap and intermixed with
writing materials; an ink-bottle, and a mustard-pot, a quill pen, and a
teaspoon lying side by side. The girl’s fortitude had given way before
this new and most cruel disappointment. She covered her face with her
hands and sobbed aloud.

Major Lennard was very much distressed at this unexpected collapse upon
the part of his chief. He was very big, and rather stupid; but he had
one of those tender childish natures which, never learn to be hard and
unmerciful. He was for ever patting the shock heads of dirty pauper
children, for ever fumbling in his pockets for copper coin, always open
to the influence of any story of womanly distress, and quite unable to
withstand the dingiest female, if she could only produce the merest
phantom of a tear to be wiped away furtively from one eye, while the
other looked round the corner to see if the shot went home.

He looked piteously at Eleanor, as she sat sobbing passionately, half
unconscious of his presence, forgetful of everything except that this
last hope had failed her.

“I thought that he might leave Paris, and go back to Launcelot
Darrell,” she said, in a broken voice, “but I never thought of anything
like this.”

“Sh-sh-sh-sh!” cried Monsieur Bourdon from the bed. “Ftz! Cats, cats!
Sh-sh-sh-sh! Chase those cats, somebody! There’s the girl Faust saw
upon the Bracken with the little rat running out of her mouth! There,
sitting at the table! Go then, Voleuse, Gueuse, Infâme!” screamed the
Frenchman, glaring at Eleanor.

The girl took no notice of him. Her sobs grew every moment louder and
more hysterical. The major looked at her helplessly.

“Don’t,” he said, “my good creature, don’t now. This is really
dreadful, ’pon my soul, now. Come, come, now; cheer up, my dear, cheer
up. You won’t do anything by giving way, you know. I always tell
Margaret that, when she thinks she can catch the train by sitting on
the ground and crying because her portmanteaus won’t shut. Nobody ever
did, you know, and if you don’t put your shoulder to the wheel——”

The major might have rambled on in this wise for some time; but the
sobbing grew louder; and he felt that it was imperatively necessary
that something energetic should be done in this crisis. A bright
thought flashed upon him as he looked hopelessly round the room, and in
another moment he had seized a small white crockery-ware jug from the
Frenchman’s toilet table, and launched its contents at Eleanor’s head.

This was a second master-stroke. The girl looked up with her head
dripping, but with her courage revived by the shock her senses had
received.

She took off her wet bonnet, and pushed the drenched hair from her
forehead.

“Oh, major,” she said, “I know I have been very silly. But I was so
taken by surprise. It seems so cruel that this should happen. I shall
never get the will now.”

“Stuff and nonsense, my dear,” exclaimed Major Lennard. “What’s to
prevent your getting it?”

“What do you mean?

“What’s to prevent _your taking it_? We’re not going to stand upon
ceremony with such a feller as this, are we, Mrs. Monckton? He stole
the will from you, and if you can get the chance, you’ll return the
compliment by stealing it from him. Fair play’s a jewel, my dear Mrs.
M., and nothing could be fairer than that. So we’ll set to work at
once; and I hope you’ll excuse the cold water, which was meant in
kindness, I assure you.”

Eleanor smiled, and gave the major her hand.

“I’m sure it was,” she said. “I scarcely liked the idea of your coming
with me, major, for fear you should do some mischief by being a little
too impetuous. But I don’t know what I should have done without you.”

Major Lennard shrugged his shoulders with a deprecating gesture.

“I _might_ have been useful to you, my dear,” he said, “if the feller
had been all right and I could have punched his head; but one can’t get
any credit out of a chap when he’s in that state,” added the major,
pointing to the commercial traveller, who was taking journeys on his
own account into the horrible regions of an intemperate man’s fancy.

“Now, the first thing we shall want, Mrs. Monckton,” said the major,
“is a candle and a box of lucifers. We must have a light before we can
do anything.”

It was not dark yet; but the twilight was growing greyer and greyer,
and the shadows were gathering in the corners of the room.

Victor Bourdon lay glaring at his two visitors through the dusk, while
the major groped about the mantelpiece for a box of lucifers. He was
not long in finding what he wanted. He struck a little waxen match
against the greasy paper of the wall, and then lighted an end of candle
in a tawdry cheap china candlestick.

“Ease her, ease her!” cried the Frenchman; “I see the lights ahead off
Normandy, on this side of the wind. She’ll strike upon a rock before we
know where we are. What are they about, these English sailors? are they
blind, that they don’t see the light?”

Major Lennard, with the candle in his hand, set to work to look for the
missing document. He did not look very systematically, but as he pulled
out every drawer and opened every cupboard, and shook out the contents
of every receptacle, flinging them remorselessly upon the floor, he
certainly looked pretty effectually. Eleanor, kneeling on the ground
amongst the chaotic heap of clothes and papers, tattered novels, broken
meerschaum pipes and stale cigar ends, examined every pocket, every
book, and every paper separately, but with no result. The drawers had
been ransacked, the cupboards disembowelled, a couple of portmanteaus
completely emptied. Every nook and corner of the two small rooms had
been most thoroughly searched, first by the major in a slap-dash and
military manner; afterwards by Eleanor, who did her work with calmness
and deliberation, though her heart was beating, and the hot blood
surging in her over-excited brain. Every possible hiding-place in the
two rooms had been examined, but the will had not been found.

Every possible hiding-place had been examined; except the pockets of
Victor Bourdon’s trousers, and the bed upon which he lay.

The major stopped to scratch his head in despair, and stood staring
hopelessly at the unhappy victim of his own vices, who was still
raving, still remonstrating with invisible demons. But Eleanor aroused
her friend from this state of stupefaction.

“He may have the will about him, major,” she said.

“Aha!” cried the soldier, “if he has, I’ll have it out of him. Give it
me, you unconscionable blackguard,” he exclaimed, pouncing upon the
delirious Frenchman. “I’ll have it out of you, you scoundrel. Tell me
where it is directly. _Dites-moi où il est, dong!_ What have you done
with it, sir? What have you done with Maurice de Crespigny’s will?”

The familiar name aroused a transitory gleam of consciousness in Victor
Bourdon.

“Ha, ha!” he cried, with a malicious chuckle. “Maurice de Crespigny,
the old, the parent of that Long—cellotte; but I will have my revenge;
but he shall not enjoy his riches. The will, the will; that is mine; it
will give me all.”

He raised himself by a great effort into a sitting posture, and made
frantic endeavours to disengage his hands.

“He is thinking of the will,” cried Eleanor; “loosen his wrists, major!
Pray, pray, do, before the thought leaves him.”

Major Lennard obeyed. He loosened the knot of the silk handkerchief,
but before he could remove it, Victor Bourdon had pulled his hands
through the slackened noose, and clutched at something in his breast.
It was a folded paper which he snatched out of the bosom of his shirt,
and waved triumphantly above his head.

“Aha, Monsieur Long—cellotte!” he screamed. “I will pay thee for thy
insolence, my friend.”

But before the Frenchman’s uplifted arm had described a second circle
in the air above his head, the major swooped down upon him, snatched
away the paper, handed it to Eleanor, and resecured Monsieur Bourdon’s
wrists with the silk handkerchief.

So brief had been the interval of semi-consciousness, that the
commercial traveller had already forgotten all about Launcelot Darrell
and his own wrongs, and had rambled off again into impotent execrations
against the imaginary demons amongst the bed-curtains.

Eleanor unfolded the paper, but she only read the first few words, “I,
Maurice de Crespigny, being at this time, &c.,” for before she could
read more, the door of the outer room was suddenly opened, and Richard
Thornton hurried through into the bed-chamber.

But not Richard only; behind him came Gilbert Monckton, and it was he
into whose outstretched arms Eleanor flung herself.

“You will believe me now, Gilbert,” she cried. “I have found the proof
of Launcelot Darrell’s guilt at last.”




CHAPTER LVII.

MAURICE DE CRESPIGNY’S BEQUEST.


Richard Thornton had received Eleanor’s letter in Edinburgh, and had
been travelling perpetually since his receipt of the girl’s eager
epistle. He had calculated that by travelling day and night he should
be able to accomplish a great achievement in the four days that were to
elapse between the hour in which he received Eleanor’s letter and the
hour appointed for the interview with the Frenchman. This achievement
was the reconciliation of Gilbert Monckton and his wife.

For this purpose the devoted young man had travelled from Edinburgh
to London, and from London to Torquay, back to London again, with Mr.
Monckton for his companion, and from London to Paris, still in that
gentleman’s companionship. Gilbert Monckton would have thought it a
small thing to have given half his fortune in payment of the tidings
which the scene-painter carried to him.

He should see his wife again; his bright and beautiful young wife, whom
he had so cruelly wronged, and so stupidly misunderstood.

Human nature is made up of contradictions. From the hour in which
Gilbert Monckton had turned his back upon Tolldale Priory, deserting
his young wife in a paroxysm of jealous anger until now, he had done
nothing but repent of his own work. Why had he disbelieved in her? How
had he been vile enough to doubt her? Had she not stood before him,
with the glorious light of truth shining out of her beautiful face?
Even had he not already repented, Eleanor’s letter would have opened
the jealous husband’s eyes to his own folly; that brief offended letter
in which the brave girl had repudiated her husband’s offer of wealth
and independence; and had declared her proud determination to go out
into the world once more, and to get her own living, and to accept
nothing from the man who doubted her truth.

The lawyer had made every effort to lure the lost bird back to its
deserted nest. But if you render your wife’s existence intolerable,
and she runs away from you in despair, it is not always possible to
bring her back to your halls; though you may be never so penitent
for your offences against her. Gilbert Monckton had employed every
possible means to discover his wife’s whereabouts; but had failed most
completely to do so. His search was futile; his advertisements were
unanswered; and, very lonely and miserable, he had dragged out the
last six weeks, in constant oscillation between London and Torquay;
always making some new effort to obtain tidings of the missing girl;
perpetually beguiled a little way onward with false hopes, only to be
disappointed. He had gone again and again to Signora Picirillo; but had
received no comfort from her, inasmuch as the music mistress knew no
more about Eleanor than he did.

It is not to be wondered, then, that when Richard Thornton appeared
at Torquay, carrying with him Eleanor’s letter, he was received with
open arms by the penitent husband. Not an hour was wasted by the eager
travellers, but use what haste they might, they could not hasten the
Dover express, or the Calais packets, or the comfortable jog-trot pace
of the train between Calais and Paris; so they had only been able to
arrive at eight o’clock in the dusky April evening, just in time to
behold Major Lennard in his moment of triumph.

Gilbert Monckton extended his hand to the stalwart soldier, after the
events of the evening had been hurriedly related by Eleanor and her
companion.

“You robbed me of a wife twenty years ago, Major Lennard,” he said,
“but you have restored another wife to me to-night.”

“Then I suppose we’re quits,” the major exclaimed, cheerfully, “and we
can go back to the Palais and have a devilled lobster, Hay? I suppose
we must do something for this poor devil, though, first, Hay?”

Mr. Monckton heartily concurred in this suggestion; and Richard
Thornton, who was better acquainted with Paris than any of his
companions, ran down stairs, told the portress of the malady which
had stricken down the lodger in the entresol, despatched the sharp
young damsel with the shrill voice in search of a sick nurse, and went
himself to look for a doctor. In a little more than half an hour both
these officials had arrived, and Mr. Monckton and his wife, Major
Lennard, and Richard departed, leaving the Frenchman in the care of
his two compatriots. But before Gilbert Monckton left the apartment,
he gave the nurse special orders respecting the sick man. She was not
to let him leave his rooms upon any pretence whatever; not even if he
should appear to become reasonable.

Mr. Monckton went to the Hôtel du Palais, with his young wife, and for
the first time since he had been wronged forgave the frivolous woman
who had jilted him. She had been very kind to Eleanor, and he was in a
humour to be pleased with any one who had been good to his wife. So the
lawyer shook hands very heartily with Mrs. Lennard, and promised that
she should see her daughter before long.

“The poor little girl has had a hard trial lately, Mrs. Lennard,
through my folly, and I owe her some atonement. I separated her from
her natural protectors, because I was presumptuous enough to imagine
that I was better fitted to plan her destiny; and after all I have
wrecked her girlish hopes, poor child! But I don’t think the damage is
irreparable; I think she’ll scarcely break her heart about Launcelot
Darrell.”

In all this time nobody had cared to ask any questions about the will.
Eleanor had handed it to her husband; and Gilbert Monckton had put
it, still folded, into his pocket. But when the devilled lobster and
the sparkling Moselle, which the major insisted upon ordering, had
been discussed, and the table cleared, Mr. Monckton took the important
document from his pocket.

“We may as well look at poor De Crespigny’s last testament,” he
said, “and see who has been most injured by the success of Launcelot
Darrell’s fabrication.”

He read the first two sheets of the will to himself, slowly and
thoughtfully. He remembered every word of those two first sheets.
So far the real will was verbatim the same as the forged document:
Gilbert Monckton could therefore now understand why that fabricated
will had seemed so genuine. The fabrication had been copied from the
original paper. It was thus that the forgery had borne the stamp of the
testator’s mind. The only difference between the two documents lay in
the last and most important clause.

The lawyer read aloud this last sheet of Maurice de Crespigny’s will.

 “I devise and bequeath all the residue and remainder of my real and
 personal property unto Hortensia Bannister, the daughter of my old
 and deceased college friend, George Vane, and my valued friend Peter
 Sedgewick, of Cheltenham, their heirs, executors, administrators
 and assigns, upon trust, for the sole and separate use of Eleanor,
 the daughter of my said dear deceased friend, George Vane, by his
 last wife, Eleanor Thompson, during her life, free from the control,
 debts, or engagements of any husband she may at any time have, and
 so that she shall not have power to anticipate the rents, interest,
 and annual proceeds thereof, and upon and after her decease, for such
 persons, estates, and in such manner as she shall, whether covert or
 uncovert, by will appoint; and in default of and subject to any such
 appointment, for the said Eleanor, the daughter of the said George
 Vane, her heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, according
 to the nature of the said property. And in case the said Eleanor
 shall have departed this life during my lifetime, or in case the said
 last-named trustees cannot discover the said Eleanor Vane within four
 years after my decease, then they shall consider the said Eleanor Vane
 dead, and therefrom I give and devise the said residuary estates to
 be equally divided between my said three nieces, Sarah, Lavinia, and
 Ellen, absolutely.

“It is fortunate that the money is left to trustees for your separate
use, Eleanor,” Mr. Monckton said. “If it had been otherwise, the
gift would have been invalid, since I, your husband, was one of the
witnesses to the will.”

A torrent of congratulations from Major and Mrs. Lennard, and
Richard Thornton, almost overwhelmed Eleanor; but she was still more
overwhelmed by her astonishment at the wording of the will.

“The money left to me!” she exclaimed. “I didn’t want it. I am sorry it
should be so. It will seem now as if I had been plotting to get this
fortune. I don’t want it; I only want my revenge.”

Gilbert Monckton narrowly watched his wife’s astonished face. He saw no
look of triumph, no smile of gratification. At least she was free from
any mercenary baseness. He took her a little way from the rest of the
party, and looked earnestly into her fearless eyes.

“My own dear love,” he said, “I have learned a hard lesson, and I
believe that I shall profit by it. I will never doubt you again. But
tell me, Eleanor, tell me once and for ever! have you ever loved
Launcelot Darrell? Have any of your actions been prompted by jealousy?”

“Not one,” cried Mrs. Monckton. “I have never loved him, and I have
never been jealous of him. From first to last I have been actuated by
one motive, and one alone—the duty I owe to my dead father.”

She had not abandoned her purpose, then. No; the lurid star that had
beckoned her forward still shone before her. It was so near now, that
its red splendour filled the universe. The young wife was pleased to be
reconciled to her husband; but with the sense that he was restored to
her once more, the memory of the dreary interval in which she had lost
him melted away from her mind, and Launcelot Darrell—Launcelot Darrell,
the destroyer of her dead father, became once more paramount in her
thoughts.

“Oh, Gilbert!” she said, clasping her hands about her husband’s arm and
looking up in his face, “you’ll take me back to England at once, won’t
you?”

“Yes, my dear,” Mr. Monckton answered, with a sigh. “I’ll do whatever
you wish.”

There was a jealous pain at his heart as he spoke. His wife was pure,
and true, and beautiful; but this strange purpose of her life divided
her from him, and left his own existence very blank.




CHAPTER LVIII.

THE DAY OF RECKONING.


Launcelot Darrell and his mother had inhabited Woodlands for a
little more than a fortnight. The painters, and paper-hangers, and
upholsterers had done a great deal to alter the handsome country-house;
for Mr. Darrell had no wish to be reminded of his dead uncle; and
familiar chairs and tables have an unpleasant faculty of suggesting
tiresome thoughts, and recalling faded faces that had better be
forgotten. Almost all the old furniture had been swept away, therefore,
and the young man had behaved very generously to his maiden aunts, who
had furnished a small house in Windsor with the things that Launcelot
had banished from Woodlands. These poor disappointed ladies had located
themselves in a quiet little _cul-de-sac_, squeezed in between the
hilly street and the castle, with the idea that the wild dissipations
of a town life would enable them to forget their wrongs.

So Launcelot Darrell and his mother reigned at Woodlands instead of
the maiden sisters; and Parker, the butler, and Mrs. Jepcott, the
housekeeper, waited upon a new master and mistress.

The young man had chafed bitterly at his poverty, and had hated himself
and all the world, because of those humiliations to which a man who is
too idle to work, and too poor to live without work, is always more or
less subject. But, alas! now that by the commission of a crime he had
attained the great end of his ambition, he found that the game was not
worth the candle; and that in his most fretful moments before Maurice
de Crespigny’s death, he had never suffered as much as he now suffered,
daily and hourly.

The murderers of the unfortunate Mr. Ware ate a hearty supper of pork
chops while their victim lay, scarcely cold, in a pond beside the high
road; but it is not everybody who is blessed with the strength of mind
possessed by those gentlemen. Launcelot Darrell could not shake off
the recollection of what he had done. From morning till night, from
night till morning, the same thoughts, the same fears, were perpetually
pressing upon him. In the eyes of every servant who looked at him; in
the voice of every creature who spoke to him; in the sound of every
bell that rang in the roomy country-house, there lurked a something
that inspired the miserable terror of detection. It haunted him in
every place; it met him at every turn. The knowledge that he was in
the power of two bad, unscrupulous men, the lawyer’s clerk and Victor
Bourdon, made him the most helpless of slaves. Already he had found
what it was to be in the power of a vicious and greedy wretch. The
clerk had been easily satisfied by the gift of a round sum of money,
and had levanted before his employer returned from America. But Victor
Bourdon became insatiable. He was a gamester and a drunkard; and he
expected to find in Launcelot Darrell’s purse a gold mine that was
never to be exhausted.

He had abandoned himself to the wildest dissipation in the worst
haunts of London after Maurice de Crespigny’s death; and had appeared
at Woodlands at all times and seasons, demanding enormous sums of his
miserable victim. At first terror sealed Launcelot Darrell’s lips,
and he acceded to the most extravagant demands of his accomplice; but
at last his temper gave way, and he refused that “paltry note for a
thousand francs,” to which the Frenchman alluded in his interview with
Eleanor. After this refusal there was a desperate quarrel between
the two men, at the end of which the commercial traveller received a
thrashing, and was turned out of doors by the master of Woodlands.

The young man had been quite reckless of consequences in his passion;
but when he grew a little calmer he began to reflect upon the issue of
this quarrel.

“I cannot see what harm the man can do me?” he thought: “to accuse me
is to accuse himself also. And then who would believe his unsupported
testimony? I could laugh at him as a madman.”

Launcelot Darrell had no knowledge of the existence of the real will.
He implicitly believed that it had been burned before his own eyes,
and that Eleanor’s assertion to the contrary had been only a woman’s
falsehood invented to terrify him.

“If the girl had once had the will in her possession she would never
have been such a fool as to lose it,” he argued.

But notwithstanding all this he felt a vague fear, all the more
terrible because of its indefinite character. He had placed himself in
a false position. The poet is born, and not made; and perhaps the same
thing may be said of the criminal. The genius of crime, like the genius
of song, may be a capricious blossom, indigenous to such and such a
soil, but not to be produced by cultivation. However this may be,
Launcelot Darrell was not a great criminal. He had none of the reckless
daring, the marvellous power of dissimulation, the blind indifference
to the future, which make a Palmer, a Cartouche, a Fauntleroy, or a
Roupell. He was wretched because of what he had done; and he allowed
everybody to perceive his wretchedness.

Mrs. Darrell saw that her son was miserable in spite of his
newly-acquired wealth; and a horrible terror seized upon her. Her
sisters had taken good care to describe to her the scene that had
occurred at Woodlands upon the night of the old man’s death. She had
watched her son, as only mothers can watch the children they love;
and she had seen that his dead kinsman’s fortune had brought him
no happiness. She had questioned him, but had received only sulky,
ungracious answers; and she had not the heart to press him too closely.

The mother and son were alone in the dining-room at Woodlands about a
week after the scene in Monsieur Victor Bourdon’s apartment. They had
dined _tête-à-tête_. The dessert had not been removed, and the young
man was sitting at the bottom of the long table, lounging lazily in
his comfortable chair, and very often refilling his glass from the
claret jug on his right hand. The three long windows were open, and the
soft May twilight crept into the room. A tall shaded lamp stood in the
centre of the table, making a great spot of yellow light in the dusk.
Below the lamp there was a confused shimmer of cut glass, upon which
the light trembled like moonbeams upon running water. There were some
purple grapes, and a litter of vine leaves in a dessert dish of Sevres
china; the spikey crown of a pine-apple; and scarlet strawberries that
made splashes of vivid colour amid the sombre green. The pictured face
of the dead man hanging upon the wall behind Launcelot Darrell’s chair
seemed to look reproachfully out of the shadows. The ruby draperies
shading the open windows grew darker with the fading of the light. The
faint odour of lilacs and hawthorn blossoms blew in from the garden,
and the evening stillness was only broken by the sound of leaves
stirred faintly by a slow night wind that crept amongst the trees.

Mrs. Darrell was sitting in the recess of one of the open windows,
with some needlework in her lap. She had brought her work into the
dining-room after dinner, because she wished to be with her son; and
she knew that Launcelot would sit for the best part of the evening
brooding over his half-filled glass. The young man was most completely
miserable. The great wrong he had done had brought upon him a torture
which he was scarcely strong enough to endure. If he could have undone
that wrong—if——! No! That way lay such shame and degradation as he
could never stoop to endure.

“It was all my great-uncle’s fault,” he repeated to himself, doggedly.
“What business had he to make the will of a madman? Whom have I robbed,
after all? Only a specious adventuress, the intriguing daughter of a
selfish spendthrift.”

Such thoughts as these were for ever rising in the young man’s mind.
He was thinking them to-night, while his mother sat in the window,
watching her son’s face furtively. He was only roused from his reverie
by the sound of wheels upon the gravel drive, the opening of a
carriage-door, and a loud ringing of the bell.

The arrival of any unexpected visitor always frightened him; so it was
nothing unusual for him to get up from his chair and go to the door of
the room to listen for the sound of voices in the hall.

To-night he turned deadly pale, as he recognized a familiar voice; the
voice of Gilbert Monckton, whom he had not seen since the reading of
the will.

Launcelot Darrell drew back as the servant approached the door, and
in another moment the man opened it, and announced Mr. Monckton, Mrs.
Monckton, Mr. Thornton, Monsieur Bourdon. He would have announced Mr.
John Ketch, I dare say, just as coolly.

Launcelot Darrell planted his back against the low marble
chimney-piece, and prepared to meet his fate. IT had come; the
realization of that horrible nightmare which had tormented him
ever since the night of Maurice de Crespigny’s death. IT had come:
detection, disgrace, humiliation, despair; no matter by what name it
was called; the thing was living death. His heart seemed to melt into
water, and then freeze in his breast. He had seen the face of Victor
Bourdon lurking behind Gilbert and Eleanor, and he knew that he had
been betrayed.

The young man knew this, and determined to make a gallant finish. He
was not a coward by nature, though his own wrongdoing had made him
cowardly; he was only an irresolute, vacillating, selfish Sybarite, who
had quarrelled with the great schoolmaster Fate, because his life had
not been made one long summer’s holiday. Even cowards sometimes grow
courageous at the last. Launcelot Darrell was not a coward: he drew
himself up to his fullest height, and prepared to confront his accusers.

Eleanor Monckton advanced towards him. Her husband tried to restrain
her, but his effort was wasted; she waived him back with her hand, and
went on to where the young man stood, with her head lifted and her
nostrils quivering.

“At last, Launcelot Darrell,” she cried, “after watching that has
wearied me, and failures that have tempted me to despair, at last, I
can keep my promise; at last I can be true to the lost father whose
death was your cruel work. When last I was in this house, you laughed
at me and defied me. I was robbed of the evidence that would have
condemned you: all the world seemed leagued together against me.
Now, the proof of your crime is in my hands, and the voice of your
accomplice has borne witness against you. Cheat, trickster, and forger;
there is no escape for you now.”

“No,” exclaimed Monsieur Bourdon, with an unctuous chuckle, “it is now
your turn to be chased, my stripling; it is now your turn to be kick
out of the door.”

“From first to last, from first to last,” said Eleanor, “you have been
false and cruel. You wronged and deceived the friends who sent you to
India——”

“Yaase!” interrupted the commercial traveller, who was very pale, and
by no means too steady in his nerves, after the attack of delirium
tremens. He had dropped into a chair, and sat trembling and grinning at
his late patron, with a ghastly jocosity that was far from agreeable
to behold. “Yaase, you cheat your mo-thair, you cheat your friends.
You make belief to go to the Indias, but you do not go. You what you
call—shally shilly, and upon the last moment, when the machine is on
the point of depart, you change the mind, you are well in England;
there is a handsome career for you, as artist, you say. Then you will
not go. But you have fear of your uncle, who was given the money for
your—fit-out—and for your passage, and you make believe to do what
they wish from you. You have a friend, a _confrère_, a Mr., who is to
partake your cabin. You write to _heem_, you get _heem_ to post your
letters; you write to your mo-thair, in Clip-a-stone Street, and you
say to her, ‘Dear mo-thair, I cannot bear this broil climate; I am
broil, I work the night and the day; I am indigo planter;’ and you
send your letter to the Indias to be posted; and your poor mo-thair
belief you; and you are in Paris to enjoy yourself, to lead the life of
a student, a little Bohemian, but very gay. You read Balzac, you make
the little sketches for the cheap Parisian journals. You are gamester,
and win money from a poor old Englishman, the father of that lady
there; and you make a catspaw of your friend, Victor Bourdon. You are a
villain man, Monsieur Darrell, but it is finished with you.”

“Listen to me, Launcelot Darrell,” Gilbert Monckton said, quietly.
“Every falsehood and trick of which you have been guilty, from first to
last, is known. There is no help for you. The will which my wife holds
in her hand is the genuine will signed by Maurice de Crespigny. This
man is prepared to testify that the will by which you took possession
of this estate is a forgery, fabricated by you and Henry Lawford’s
clerk, who had in his possession a rough draft of the real will which
he had written at Mr. de Crespigny’s dictation, and who copied the
three different signatures from three letters written by the old man
to Henry Lawford. You are prepared to bear witness to this,” added the
lawyer, turning to Victor Bourdon.

“But certainly,” exclaimed the Frenchman, “it being well understood
that I am not to suffer by this candour. It is understood that I am
innocent in this affair.”

“Innocent!” cried Launcelot Darrell, bitterly. “Why, you were the prime
mover in this business. It was your suggestion that first induced——”

“It is possible, my friend,” murmured Monsieur Bourdon, complacently;
“but is it, then, a crime to make a little suggestion—to try to make
oneself useful to a friend? I do not believe it! No matter, I have
studied your English law: I do not think it can touch me, since I am
only prepared to swear to having _found_ this real will, and having
before that _overheard_ a conversation between you and the clerk of the
avoué de Vindsor.”

“You use noble tools, Mrs. Monckton,” said Launcelot Darrell; “but I do
not know by what right you come into my house, uninvited, and bringing
in your train a very respectable transpontine scene-painter with whom I
have not the honour to be intimate, and a French commercial traveller,
who has chosen to make himself peculiarly obnoxious to me. It is for
the Court of Chancery to decide whether I am the rightful owner of this
house and all appertaining to it. I shall await the fiat of that court;
and in the meantime have the honour to wish you good evening.”

He laid his hand upon the handle of the bell as he spoke, but he did
not pull it.

“You defy me, then, Launcelot Darrell?” said Eleanor.

“I do.”

“I am glad that it is so!” exclaimed the girl. “I am glad that you have
not prayed to me for mercy. I am glad that Providence has suffered me
to avenge my father’s death.”

Eleanor Monckton was moving towards the door.

In all this time Ellen Darrell had not once spoken. She had stood apart
in the recess of the window, a dark and melancholy shadow, mourning
over the ruin of her life.

I think that she was scarcely surprised at what had happened. We
sometimes know the people we love, and know them to be base; but we go
on loving them desperately, nevertheless; and love them best when the
world is against them, and they have most need of our love. I speak
here of maternal love, which is so sublime an affection as to be next
in order to the love of God.

The widow came suddenly into the centre of the room, and cast herself
on her knees before Eleanor, and wound her arms about the girl’s
slender waist, pinning her to the spot upon which she stood, and
holding her there. The mother’s arms were stronger than bands of
iron, for they were linked about the enemy of her son. It has been
demonstrated by practical zoologists that the king of beasts, his
majesty the lion, is after all a cowardly creature. It is only the
lioness, _the mother_, whose courage is desperate and indomitable.

“You shall not do this,” Ellen Darrell cried; “you shall not bring
disgrace upon my son. Take your due, whatever it is; take your paltry
wealth. You have plotted for it, I dare say. Take it, and let us go
out of this place penniless. But no disgrace, no humiliation, no
punishment, _for him_!”

“Mother,” cried Launcelot, “get up off your knees. Let her do her
worst. I ask no mercy of her.

“Don’t hear him,” gasped the widow, “don’t listen to him. Oh, Eleanor,
save him from shame and disgrace! Save him! save him! I was always good
to you, was I not? I meant to be so, believe me. If ever I was unkind,
it was because I was distracted by regrets and anxieties about him.
Oh, Eleanor, forgive him, and be merciful to me! Forgive him. It is my
fault that he is what he is. It was my foolish indulgence that ruined
his childhood. It was my false pride that taught him to think he had a
right to my uncle’s money. From first to last, Eleanor, it is I that am
to blame. Remember this, and forgive him, forgive——”

Her throat grew dry, and her voice broke, but her lips still moved,
though no sound came from them, and she was still imploring mercy for
her son.

“Forgive!” cried Eleanor, bitterly. “Forgive the man who caused my
father’s death! Do you think I have waited and watched for nothing?
It seems to me as if all my life had been given up to this one hope.
Do you know how that man has defied me?” she exclaimed, pointing to
Launcelot Darrell. “Do you know that through him I have been divided
from my husband? Bah! why do I speak of my own wrongs? Do you know that
my father, a poor, helpless old man, a lonely, friendless old man, a
decayed gentleman, killed himself because of your son? Do you expect
that I am to forget that? Do you think that I can forgive that man? Do
you want me to abandon the settled purpose of my life—the purpose to
which I have sacrificed every girlish happiness, every womanly joy—now
that the victory is mine, and that I can keep my vow?”

She tried to disengage herself from Ellen Darrell’s arms, but the widow
still clung about her, with her head flung back, and her white face
convulsed with anguish.

“Forgive him for my sake,” she cried; “give him to me—give him to me!
He will suffer enough from the ruin of his hopes. He will suffer enough
from the consciousness of having done wrong. He _has_ suffered. Yes.
I have watched him, and I know. Take everything from him. Leave him a
penniless dependant upon the pittance my uncle left to me, but save him
from disgrace. Give him to me. God has given him to me. Woman, what
right have you to take him from me?”

“He killed my father,” Eleanor answered, in a sombre voice; “my dead
father’s letter told me to be revenged upon him.”

“Your father wrote in a moment of desperation. I knew him. I knew
George Vane. _He_ would have forgiven his worst enemy. He was the last
person to be vindictive or revengeful when his first anger was passed.
What good end will be gained by my son’s disgrace? You shall _not_
refuse to hear me. You are a wife, Eleanor Monckton: you may one day be
a mother. If you are pitiless to me now, God will be pitiless to you
then. You will think of me then. In every throb of pain your child may
suffer; in every childish ailment that makes your heart grow sick with
unutterable fear, you will recognize God’s vengeance upon you for this
night’s work. Think of this, Eleanor; think of this, and be merciful to
me—to _me_—not to him. What _he_ would have to endure would be only a
tithe of _my_ suffering. I am his mother—his mother!”

“Oh, my God!” cried Eleanor, lifting her clasped hands above her head.
“_What_ am I to do?”

The hour of her triumph had come; and in this supreme moment doubt and
fear took possession of her breast. If this was her victory, it was
only half a victory. She had never thought that any innocent creature
would suffer more cruelly by her vengeance upon Launcelot Darrell than
the man himself would suffer. And now, here was this woman, whose only
sin had been an idolatrous love of her son, and to whom his disgrace
would be worse than the anguish of death.

The widow’s agony had been too powerful for the girl’s endurance.
Eleanor burst into a passion of tears, and turning to her husband, let
her head fall upon his breast.

“What am I to do, Gilbert?” she said. “What am I to do?”

“I will not advise you, my dear,” the lawyer answered, in a low voice.
“To-night’s business is of your own accomplishing. Your own heart must
be your only guide.”

There was silence in the room for a few moments, only broken by
Eleanor’s sobbing. Launcelot Darrell had covered his face with his
hands. His courage had given way before the power of his mother’s
grief. The widow still knelt, still clung about the girl, with her
white face fixed now, in an awful stillness.

“Oh, my dear, dead father!” Eleanor sobbed, “you—you did wrong yourself
sometimes; and you were always kind and merciful to people. Heaven
knows, I have tried to keep my oath; but I cannot—I cannot. It seemed
so easy to imagine my revenge when it was far away: but now—it is too
hard—it is too hard. Take your son, Mrs. Darrell. I am a poor helpless
coward. I cannot carry out the purpose of my life.”

The white uplifted face scarcely changed, and the widow fell back in
a heap upon the floor. Her son and Gilbert Monckton lifted her up and
carried her to a chair in one of the open windows. Richard Thornton
dropped on his knees before Eleanor, and began to kiss her hands with
_effusion_.

“Don’t be frightened, Nelly,” he exclaimed. “I was very fond of you
once, and very unhappy about you, as my poor aunt can bear witness;
but I am going to marry Eliza Montalembert, and we’ve got the carpets
down at the snuggest little box in all Brixton, and I’ve made it up
with Spavin and Cromshaw in consideration of my salary being doubled.
Don’t be frightened if I make a fool of myself, Eleanor; but I think I
could worship you to-night. This is your victory, my dear. This is the
only revenge Providence ever intended for beautiful young women with
hazel-brown hair. God bless you!”

Launcelot Darrell, with a greyish pallor spread over his face, like a
napkin upon the face of a corpse, came slowly up to Eleanor.

“You have been very generous to me, Mrs. Monckton, though it is a hard
thing for me to say as much,” he said; “I have done wicked things,
but I have suffered—I have suffered and repented perpetually. I had
no thought of the awful consequences which would follow the wrong I
did your father. I have hated myself for that wicked act ever since;
I should never have forged the will if that man had not come to me,
and fooled me, and played upon my weaknesses. I will thank you for the
mercy you have shown me by-and-by, Mrs. Monckton, when I am better
worthy of your generosity.”




CHAPTER LIX.

THE LAST.


Gilbert Monckton seconded his wife in all she wished to do. There
was no scandal. All legal formalities were gone through very
quietly. Those troublesome people who require to be informed as to
the business of their neighbours, were told that a codicil had been
found, which revoked the chief clause of Mr. de Crespigny’s will. Mr.
Peter Sedgewick and Mrs. Bannister were ready to perform all acts
required of them; though the lady expressed considerable surprise at
her half-sister’s unexpected accession of wealth. Eleanor Monckton
entered into possession of the estates. The impulsive girl, having once
forgiven her father’s enemy, would fain have surrendered the fortune
to him into the bargain—but practical, matter-of-fact people were at
hand to prevent her being too generous. Mrs. Darrell and her son went
to Italy, and Mrs. Monckton, with her husband’s concurrence, made the
young man a very handsome allowance, which enabled him to pursue his
career as an artist. He worked very hard and with enthusiasm. The shame
of the past gave an impetus to his pencil. His outraged self-esteem
stood him his friend, and he toiled valiantly to redeem himself from
the disgrace that had fallen upon him.

“If I am a great painter, they will remember nothing against me,”
he said to himself; and though it was not in him to become a great
painter, he became a popular painter; a great man for the Royal
Academy, and the West-End engravers, if only a small man for future
generations, who will choose the real gems out of the prodigal wealth
of the present. Mr. Darrell’s first success was a picture which he
called “The Earl’s Death,” from a poem of Tennyson’s, with the motto,
“Oh, the Earl was fair to see,”—a preternaturally ugly man lying at
the feet of a preternaturally hideous woman, in a turret chamber
lighted by lucifer matches—the blue and green light of the lucifers
on the face of the ugly woman, and a pre-Raphaelite cypress seen,
through the window; and I am fain to say that although the picture was
ugly, there was a strange weird attraction in it, and people went
to see it again and again, and liked it, and hankered after it, and
talked of it perpetually all that season; one faction declaring that
the lucifer-match effect was the most delicious moonlight, and the
murderess of the Earl the most lovely of womankind, till the faction
who thought the very reverse of this became afraid to declare their
opinions, and thus everybody was satisfied.

So Launcelot Darrell received a fabulous price for his picture, and,
having lived without reproach during three years of probation, came
home to marry Laura Mason Lennard, who had been true to him all this
time, and who would have rather liked to unite her fortunes with those
of a modern Cartouche or Jack Sheppard for the romance of the thing.
And although the artist did not become a good man all in a moment,
like the repentant villain of a stage play, he did take to heart the
lesson of his youth. He was tenderly affectionate to the mother who had
suffered so much by reason of his errors; and he made a very tolerable
husband to a most devoted little wife.

Monsieur Victor Bourdon was remunerated, and very liberally—for his
_services_, and was told to hold his tongue. He departed for Canada
soon afterwards, in the interests of the patent mustard, and never
reappeared in the neighbourhood of Tolldale Priory.

Eleanor insisted on giving up Woodlands for the use of Mr. Darrell, his
wife, and mother. Signora Picirillo lived with her nephew and his merry
little wife in the pretty house at Brixton; but she paid very frequent
visits to Tolldale Priory, sometimes accompanied by Richard and Mrs.
Richard, sometimes alone. Matrimony has a very good effect upon the
outward seeming of the scene-painter: for his young wife initiated
him in the luxury of shirt-buttons as contrasted with pins; to say
nothing of the delights of a shower-bath, and a pair of ivory-backed
hair-brushes, presented by Eleanor as a birthday present to her old
friend. Richard at first suggested that the ivory-backed brushes
should be used as chimney ornaments in the Brixton drawing-room: but
afterwards submitted to the popular view of the subject, and brushed
his hair. Major and Mrs. Lennard were also visitors at Tolldale, and
Laura knew the happiness of paternal and maternal love—the paternal
affection evincing itself in the presentation of a great deal of
frivolous jewellery, purchased upon credit; the maternal devotion
displaying itself in a wild admiration of Launcelot Darrell’s son
and heir, a pink-faced baby, who made his appearance in the year
1861, and who was in much better drawing than the “Dying Gladiator,”
exhibited by Mr. Darrell in the same year. Little children’s voices
sounded by-and-by in the shady pathways of the old-fashioned Priory
garden, and in all Berkshire there was not a happier woman than Gilbert
Monckton’s beautiful young wife.

And, after all, Eleanor’s Victory was a proper womanly conquest, and
not a stern, classical vengeance. The tender woman’s heart triumphed
over the girl’s rash vow; and poor George Vane’s enemy was left to the
only Judge whose judgments are always righteous.


THE END.

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
