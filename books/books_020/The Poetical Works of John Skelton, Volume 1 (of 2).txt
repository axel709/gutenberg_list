PREFACE.


The very incomplete and inaccurate volume of 1736, and the reprint of
it in Chalmers’s _English Poets_,[1] 1810, have hitherto been the only
editions of Skelton accessible to the general reader.

In 1814, the Quarterly Reviewer,—after censuring Chalmers for having
merely reprinted the volume of 1736, with all its errors, and without
the addition of those other pieces by Skelton which were known to be
extant,—observed, that “an editor who should be competent to the task
could not more worthily employ himself than by giving a good and
complete edition of his works.”[2] Prompted by this remark, I commenced
the present edition,—perhaps with too much self-confidence, and certainly
without having duly estimated the difficulties which awaited me. After
all the attention which I have given to the writings of Skelton, they
still contain corruptions which defy my power of emendation, and passages
which I am unable to illustrate; nor is it, therefore, without a feeling
of reluctance that I now offer these volumes to the very limited class
of readers for whom they are intended. In revising my Notes for press, I
struck out a considerable portion of conjectures and explanations which
I had originally hazarded, being unwilling to receive from any one that
equivocal commendation which Joseph Scaliger bestowed on a literary
labourer of old; “Laudo tamen studium tuum; quia in rebus obscuris ut
errare necesse est, ita fortuitum non errare.”[3]

Having heard that Ritson had made some collections for an edition of
our author, I requested the use of those papers from his nephew, the
late Joseph Frank, Esq., who most obligingly put them into my hands:
they proved, however, to be only a transcript of _Vox Populi, vox Dei_
(from the Harleian MS.), and a few memoranda concerning Skelton from very
obvious sources.

The individual to whom I have been the most indebted for assistance
and encouragement in this undertaking has not survived to receive
my acknowledgments; I mean the late Mr. Heber, who not only lent me
his whole collection of Skelton’s works, but also took a pleasure in
communicating to me from time to time whatever information he supposed
might be serviceable. Indeed, without such liberality on the part of Mr.
Heber, a complete edition of the poet’s extant writings could not have
been produced; for his incomparable library (now unfortunately dispersed)
contained some pieces by Skelton, of which copies were not elsewhere to
be found.

To Miss Richardson Currer; the Right Hon. Thomas Grenville; the Hon. and
Rev. G. N. Grenville, Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge; Sir Harris
Nicolas; Sir Francis Palgrave; Rev. Dr. Bandinel; Rev. Dr. Bliss; Rev.
John Mitford; Rev. J. J. Smith of Caius College, Cambridge; Rev. Joseph
Hunter; Rev. Joseph Stevenson; W. H. Black, Esq.; Thomas Amyot, Esq.;
J. P. Collier, Esq.; Thomas Wright, Esq.; J. O. Halliwell, Esq.; Albert
Way, Esq.; and David Laing, Esq.;—I have to return my grateful thanks for
the important aid of various kinds which they so readily and courteously
afforded me.

                                                          ALEXANDER DYCE.

[1] “Mr. A. Chalmers,” says Haslewood, “has since given place [_sic_] to
Skelton’s name among the English poets [vol. ii. p. 227]: and having had
an opportunity to compare the original edition [that of Marshe, 1568]
with Mr. Chalmers’s volume, I can pronounce the text verbally accurate,
although taken from the reprint of 1736.” _Brit. Bibliogr._ iv. 389.
As Haslewood was generally a careful collator, I am greatly surprised
at the above assertion: the truth is, that the reprint of 1736 (every
word of which I have compared with Marshe’s edition—itself replete with
errors) is in not a few places grossly inaccurate.—The said reprint is
without the editor’s name; but I have seen a copy of it in which Gifford
had written with a pencil, “Edited by J. Bowle, the stupidest of all
two-legged animals.”

[2] _Q. Rev._ xi. 485. The critique in question was written by Mr.
Southey,—who, let me add, took a kind interest in the progress of the
present edition.

The preceding Preface was already in type, when Mr. W. H. Black
discovered, among the Public Records, an undoubted poem by Skelton
(hitherto unprinted), which I now subjoin.




A LAWDE AND PRAYSE MADE FOR OUR SOUEREIGNE LORD THE KYNG.[4]


[Sidenote: Candida, punica, &c.]

  The Rose both White and Rede
    In one Rose now dothe grow;
  Thus thorow every stede[5]
    Thereof the fame dothe blow:
    Grace the sede did sow:
  England, now gaddir flowris,
  Exclude now all dolowrs.

[Sidenote: Nobilis Henricus, &c.]

  Noble Henry the eight,
    Thy loving souereine lorde,
  Of kingis line moost streight,
    His titille dothe recorde:
    In whome dothe wele acorde
  Alexis yonge of age,
  Adrastus wise and sage.

[Sidenote: Sedibus ætheriis, &c.]

  Astrea, Justice hight,
    That from the starry sky
  Shall now com and do right,
    This hunderd yere scantly
    A man kowd not aspy
  That Right dwelt vs among,
  And that was the more wrong:

[Sidenote: Arcebit vulpes, &c.]

  Right shall the foxis chare,[6]
    The wolvis, the beris also,
  That wrowght have moche care,
    And browght Englond in wo:
    They shall wirry no mo,[7]
  Nor wrote[8] the Rosary[9]
  By extort trechery:

[Sidenote: Ne tanti regis, &c.]

  Of this our noble king
    The law they shall not breke;
  They shall com to rekening;
    No man for them wil speke:
    The pepil durst not creke
  Theire grevis to complaine,
  They browght them in soche paine:

[Sidenote: Ecce Platonis secla, &c.]

  Therfor no more they shall
    The commouns ouerbace,
  That wont wer ouer all
    Both lorde and knight to face;[10]
    For now the yeris of grace
  And welthe ar com agayne,
  That maketh England faine.[11]

[Sidenote: Rediit jam pulcher Adonis, &c.]

  Adonis of freshe colour,
    Of yowthe the godely flour,
  Our prince of high honour,
    Our paves,[12] our succour,
    Our king, our emperour,
  Our Priamus of Troy,
  Our welth, our worldly joy;

[Sidenote: Anglorum radians, &c.]

  Vpon vs he doth reigne,
    That makith our hartis glad,
  As king moost soueraine
    That ever Englond had;
    Demure, sober, and sad,[13]
  And Martis lusty knight;
  God save him in his right!

                  Amen.

_Bien men souient._[14]

_Per me laurigerum Britonum Skeltonida vatem._

[4] _A lawde and prayse made for our souereigne lord the kyng_] Such (in
a different handwriting from that of the poem) is the endorsement of the
MS., which consists of two leaves, bound up in the volume marked _B._
2. 8 (pp. 67-69), among the Records of the Treasury of the Receipt of
the Exchequer, now at the Rolls House.—Qy. is this poem the piece which,
in the catalogue of his own writings, Skelton calls “The Boke of the
Rosiar,” _Garlande of Laurell_, v. 1178, vol. i. 408?

[5] _stede_] i. e. place.

[6] _chare_] i. e. chase, drive away (see _Prompt. Parv._ i. 70. Camden
Soc. ed.).

[7] _mo_] i. e. more.

[8] _wrote_] i. e. root.

[9] _Rosary_] i. e. Rose-bush.

[10] _face_] See Notes, vol. ii. 216.

[11] _faine_] i. e. glad.

[12] _paves_] i. e. shield (properly, a large shield covering the body).

[13] _sad_] i. e. grave—discreet.

[14] _Bien men souient_] These words are followed in the MS. by a sort of
flourished device, which might perhaps be read—“_Deo (21ͦ) gratias_.”

SOME ACCOUNT OF SKELTON AND HIS WRITINGS.


John Skelton[15] is generally said to have been descended from the
Skeltons of Cumberland;[16] but there is some reason to believe that
Norfolk was his native county. The time of his birth, which is left to
conjecture, cannot well be carried back to an earlier year than 1460.

The statement of his biographers, that he was educated at Oxford,[17] I
am not prepared to contradict: but if he studied there, it was at least
after he had gone through an academical course at the sister university;
for he has himself expressly declared,

  “Alma parens O Cantabrigensis,
  ...
        ...tibi quondam carus alumnus eram;”

adding in a marginal note, “Cantabrigia Skeltonidi laureato primam mammam
eruditionis pientissime propinavit.”[18] Hence it is probable that the
poet was the “one Scheklton,” who, according to Cole, became M.A. at
Cambridge in 1484.[19]

Of almost all Skelton’s writings which have descended to our times,
the first editions[20] have perished; and it is impossible to determine
either at what period he commenced his career as a poet, or at what dates
his various pieces were originally printed. That he was the author of
many compositions which are no longer extant, we learn from the pompous
enumeration of their titles in the _Garlande of Laurell_[21]. The lines
_Of the death of the noble prince, ynge Edwarde the forth_[22], who
deceased in 1483, were probably among his earliest attempts in verse.

In 1489 Skelton produced an elegy _Vpon the doulourus dethe and muche
lamentable chaunce of the most honorable Erle of Northumberlande_,[23]
who was slain during a popular insurrection in Yorkshire. His son Henry
Algernon Percy, the fifth earl, who is there mentioned as the “yonge
lyon, but tender yet of age,”[24] appears to have afterwards extended
his patronage to the poet:[25] at a time when persons of the highest rank
were in general grossly illiterate, this nobleman was both a lover and a
liberal encourager of letters.

Skelton had acquired great reputation as a scholar, and had recently
been laureated at Oxford,[26] when Caxton, in 1490, published _The
boke of Eneydos compyled by Vyrgyle_,[27] in the Preface to which is
the following passage: “But I praye mayster John Skelton, late created
poete laureate in the vnyuersite of oxenforde, to ouersee and correcte
this sayd booke, And taddresse and expowne where as shalle be founde
faulte to theym that shall requyre it. For hym I knowe for suffycyent
to expowne and englysshe euery dyffyculte that is therin. For he hath
late translated the epystlys of Tulle,[28] and the boke of dyodorus
syculus,[29] and diuerse other werkes oute of latyn in to englysshe, not
in rude and olde langage, but in polysshed and ornate termes craftely, as
he that hath redde vyrgyle, ouyde, tullye, and all the other noble poetes
and oratours, to me vnknowen: And also he hath redde the ix. muses and
vnderstande theyr musicalle scyences, and to whom of theym eche scyence
is appropred. I suppose he hath dronken of Elycons well. Then I praye
hym & suche other to correcte adde or mynysshe where as he or they shall
fynde faulte,”[30] &c. The laureatship in question, however, was not the
office of poet laureat according to the modern acceptation of the term:
it was a degree in grammar, including rhetoric and versification, taken
at the university, on which occasion the graduate was presented with a
wreath of laurel.[31] To this academical honour Skelton proudly alludes
in his fourth poem _Against Garnesche_;

  “A kyng to me myn habyte gaue:
  At Oxforth, the vniversyte,
  Auaunsid I was to that degre;
  By hole consent of theyr senate,
  I was made poete lawreate.”[32]

Our laureat, a few years after, was admitted _ad eundem_ at Cambridge:
“An. Dom. 1493, et Hen. 7 nono. Conceditur Johī Skelton Poete in partibus
transmarinis atque Oxon. Laurea ornato, ut apud nos eadem decoraretur;”
again, “An. 1504-5, Conceditur Johi Skelton, Poetæ Laureat. quod possit
stare eodem gradu hic, quo stetit Oxoniis, et quod possit uti habitu sibi
concesso a Principe.” Warton, who cites both these entries,[33] remarks,
“the latter clause, I believe, relates to some distinction of habit,
perhaps of fur or velvet, granted him by the king.” There can be no doubt
that Skelton speaks of this peculiar apparel in the lines just quoted, as
also in his third poem _Against Garnesche_, where he says,

  “Your sworde ye swere, I wene,
  So tranchaunt and so kene,
  Xall kyt both _wyght and grene_:
  Your foly ys to grett
  _The kynges colours_ to threte;”[34]

from which we may infer that he wore, as laureat, a dress of white and
green, or, perhaps, a white dress with a wreath of laurel. It was most
probably on some part of the same habit that the word _Calliope_ was
embroidered in letters of silk and gold:

  “Calliope,
  As ye may se,
  Regent is she
    Of poetes al,
  Whiche gaue to me
  The high degre
  Laureat to be
    Of fame royall;
  _Whose name enrolde_
  _With silke and golde_
  _I dare be bolde_
    _Thus for to were_,”[35] &c.

In the following passage Barclay perhaps glances at Skelton, with whom
(as will afterwards be shewn) he was on unfriendly terms;

  “But of their writing though I ensue the rate,
  No name I chalenge of _Poete laureate_:
  That name vnto them is mete and doth agree
  Which writeth matters with curiositee.
  Mine habite blacke accordeth not with _grene_,
  Blacke betokeneth death as it is dayly sene;
  The _grene_ is pleasour, freshe lust and iolite;
  These two in nature hath great diuersitie.
  Then who would ascribe, except he were a foole,
  The pleasaunt _laurer_ vnto the mourning cowle?”[36]

Warton has remarked, that some of Skelton’s Latin verses, which are
subscribed—“Hæc laureatus Skeltonis, regius orator”—“Per Skeltonida
laureatum, oratorem regium,”—seem to have been written in the character
of _royal_ laureate;[37] and perhaps the expression “of fame royall”
in Skelton’s lines on _Calliope_ already cited, may be considered as
strengthening this supposition. There would, indeed, be no doubt that
Skelton was not only a poet laureated at the universities, but also
poet laureat or court poet to Henry the Eighth, if the authenticity
of the following statement were established; “la patente qui declare
Skelton poète laureat d’Henry viii. est datée de la cinquième année de
son règne, ce qui tombe en 1512 ou 1513:” so (after giving correctly
the second entry concerning Skelton’s laureation at Cambridge) writes
the Abbé du Resnel in an essay already mentioned; having received, it
would seem, both these statements concerning Skelton from Carte the
historian,[38] who, while he communicated to Du Resnel one real document,
was not likely to have forged another for the purpose of misleading the
learned Frenchman. On this subject I can only add, that no proof has been
discovered of Skelton’s having enjoyed an annual salary from the crown in
consequence of such an office.

The reader will have observed that in the first entry given above
from the Cambridge Univ. Regist., Skelton is described as having been
laureated not only at Oxford but also “transmarinis partibus.” That
the foreign seat of learning at which he received this honour was the
university of Louvaine,[39] may be inferred from the title of a poem
which I subjoin entire, not only because it occurs in a volume of the
greatest rarity, but because it evinces the celebrity which Skelton had
attained.

  Sat cecinisse tuum sit, mi Schelton, tibi laudi

Ex capitalibus hexametrorum litteris solerter compositis emergit hoc
distichon;

  Quæ Whitintonus canit ad laudes tibi, Schelton,
      Anglorum vatum gloria, sume libens.”[42]

Another laudatory notice of Skelton by a contemporary writer will not
here be out of place;

  “To all auncient poetes, litell boke, submytte the,
    Whilom flouryng in eloquence facundious,
  And to all other whiche present nowe be;
    Fyrst to maister Chaucer and Ludgate sentencious,
    Also to preignaunt Barkley nowe beying religious,
      To _inuentiue Skelton and poet laureate_;
      Praye them all of pardon both erly and late.”[43]

Skelton frequently styles himself “_orator regius_;”[44] but the nature
of the office from which he derived the title is not, I believe,
understood. The lines in which, as we have just seen, Whittington so
lavishly praises his “rhetoricus sermo,” allude most probably to his
performances in the capacity of royal orator.

In 1498 Skelton took holy orders. The days on which, during that year, he
was ordained successively subdeacon, deacon, and priest, are ascertained
by the following entries:

    “[In ecclesia conuentuali domus siue hospitalis sancti Thome
    martiris de Acon ciuitatis London. per Thomam Rothlucensem
    episcopum vltimo die mensis Marcii]

    M. Johannes Skelton London, dioc. ad titulum Mon. beate Marie
    de Graciis iuxta Turrim London.”

    “[In cathedra sancti Pauli London. apud summum altare eiusdem
    per Thomam permissione diuina London, episcopum in sabbato
    sancto viz. xiiii die mensis Aprilis]

    Johannes Skelton poete [_sic_] laureatus Lond. dioc. ad titulum
    Mon. de Graciis juxta turrim London.”

    “[In ecclesia conuentuali hospitalis beate Marie de Elsyng per
    Thomam Rothlucensem episcopum ix die mensis Iunii]

    M. Johannes Skelton poeta lureatus [_sic_] London. dioc. ad
    titulum Mon. de Graciis iuxta turrim London.”[45]

When Arthur, the eldest son of Henry the Seventh, was created Prince of
Wales and Earl of Chester, in 1489,[46] Skelton celebrated the event in
a composition (probably poetical) called _Prince Arturis Creacyoun_,[47]
of which the title alone remains; and when Prince Henry, afterwards Henry
the Eighth, was created Duke of York, in 1494,[48] he was hailed by our
author in some Latin verses—_Carmen ad principem, quando insignitus erat
ducis Ebor. titulo_,—a copy of which (not to be found at present) was
once among the MSS. in the Library of Lincoln Cathedral, having been seen
by Tanner, who cites the initial words,—“Si quid habes, mea Musa.”[49]

As at the last-mentioned date Prince Henry was a mere infant, there can
be no doubt that the care of his education had not yet been entrusted to
our poet. It must have been several years after 1494 that Skelton was
appointed tutor to that prince,—an appointment which affords a striking
proof of the high opinion entertained of his talents and learning, as
well as of the respectability of his character. He has himself recorded
that he held this important situation:

  “The honor of Englond I lernyd to spelle,
  In dygnyte roialle that doth excelle:
  Note and marke wyl[50] thys parcele;
  I yaue hym drynke of the sugryd welle
  Of Eliconys waters crystallyne,
  Aqueintyng hym with the Musys nyne.
  Yt commyth thé wele me to remorde,
  That creaunser[51] was to thy sofre[yne] lorde:
  It plesyth that noble prince roialle
  Me as hys master for to calle
  In hys lernyng primordialle.”[52]

And in another poem he informs us that he composed a treatise for the
edification of his royal pupil:

  “The Duke of Yorkis creauncer whan Skelton was,
    Now Henry the viii. Kyng of Englonde,
  A tratyse he deuysid and browght it to pas,
    Callid _Speculum Principis_, to here in his honde,
    Therin to rede, and to vnderstande
  All the demenour of princely astate,
  To be our Kyng, of God preordinate.”[53]

The _Speculum Principis_ has perished: we are unable to determine whether
it was the same work as that entitled _Methodos Skeltonidis laureati_,
sc. _Præcepta quædam moralia Henrico principi, postea Henr. viii, missa_.
Dat. apud Eltham A.D. MDI., which in Tanner’s days[54] was extant
(mutilated at the beginning) among the MSS. in the Lincoln-Cathedral
Library, but which (like the Latin verses mentioned in a preceding page)
has since been allowed to wander away from that ill-guarded collection.

When Prince Henry was a boy of nine years old, Erasmus dedicated to him
an ode _De Laudibus Britanniæ, Regisque Henrici Septimi ac Regiorum
Liberorum_. The Dedication contains the following memorable encomium on
Skelton; “Et hæc quidem interea tamquam ludicra munuscula tuæ pueritiæ
dicavimus, uberiora largituri ubi tua virtus una cum ætate accrescens
uberiorem carminum materiam suppeditabit. Ad quod equidem te adhortarer,
nisi et ipse jamdudum sponte tua velis remisque (ut aiunt) eo tenderes,
et _domi haberes Skeltonum, unum Britannicarum literarum lumen ac decus_,
qui tua studia possit, non solum accendere, sed etiam consummare;” and in
the Ode are these lines;

  “Jam puer Henricus, genitoris nomine lætus,
    _Monstrante fonteis vate Skeltono sacros_,
  Palladias teneris meditatur ab unguibus arteis.”[55]

The circumstances which led to the production of this Ode are related
by Erasmus in the following curious passage: “Is erat labor tridui, et
tamen labor, quod jam annos aliquot nec legeram nec scripseram ullum
carmen. Id partim pudor a nobis extorsit, partim dolor. Pertraxerat me
Thomas Morus,[56] qui tum me in prædio Montjoii[57] agentem inviserat,
ut animi causa in proximum vicum[58] expatiaremur. Nam illic educabantur
omnes liberi regii, uno Arcturo excepto, qui tum erat natu maximus. Ubi
ventum est in aulam, convenit tota pompa, non solum domus illius, verum
etiam Montjoiicæ. Stabat in medio Henricus annos natus novem, jam tum
indolem quandam regiam præ se ferens, h. e. animi celsitudinem cum
singulari quadam humanitate conjunctam. A dextris erat Margareta, undecim
ferme annos nata, quæ post nupsit Jacobo Scotorum Regi. A sinistris,
Maria lusitans, annos nata quatuor. Nam Edmondus adhuc infans, in ulnis
gestabatur. Morus cum Arnoldo sodali salutato puero Henrico, quo rege
nunc floret Britannia, nescio quid scriptorum obtulit. Ego, quoniam
hujusmodi nihil expectabam, nihil habens quod exhiberem, pollicitus sum
aliquo pacto meum erga ipsum studium aliquando declaraturum. Interim
subirascebar Moro, quod non præmonuisset; et eo magis, quod puer
Epistolio inter prandendum ad me misso, meum calamum provocaret. Abii
domum, ac vel invitis Musis, cum quibus jam longum fuerat divortium,
Carmen intra triduum absolvi. Sic et ultus sum dolorem meum, et pudorem
sarsi.”[59]

The mother of Henry the Seventh, the Countess of Richmond and Derby,
is well known to have used her utmost exertions for the advancement of
literature: she herself translated some pieces from the French; and,
under her patronage, several works (chiefly works of piety) were rendered
into English by the most competent scholars of the time. It is to her, I
apprehend, that Skelton alludes in the following passage of the _Garlande
of Laurell_, where he mentions one of his lost performances;

  “Of _my ladys grace_ at the contemplacyoun,
    Owt of Frenshe into Englysshe prose,
  Of Mannes Lyfe the Peregrynacioun,
    He did translate, enterprete, and disclose.”[60]

According to Churchyard, Skelton was “seldom out of princis grace:”[61]
yet among the _Actes, Orders, and Decrees made by the King and his
Counsell, remaining amongst the Records of the Court, now commonly
called the Court of Requests_, we find, under _anno_ 17. _Henry_ vii.;
“10 Junii apud Westminster _Jo. Skelton_ commissus carceribus Janitoris
Domini Regis.”[62] What could have occasioned this restraint, I cannot
even conjecture: but in those days of extra-judicial imprisonments he
might have been incarcerated for a very slight offence. It is, however,
by no means certain that the “_Jo. Skelton_” of the above entry was the
individual who forms the subject of the present essay;[63] and it is
equally doubtful whether or not the following entry, dated the same year,
relates to the mother of the poet;

    (Easter term, 17. Henry vii.) “_Johanne Skelton_  } iij. _li._ vj.
      vidue de regard. Domini Regis[64]               } _s._ viij. _d._”

It has been already shewn that Skelton took holy orders in 1498.[65] How
soon after that period he became rector of Diss in Norfolk, or what
portion of his life was spent there in the exercise of his duties, cannot
be ascertained. He certainly resided there in 1504 and 1511,[66] and, as
it would seem from some of his compositions,[67] in 1506, 1507, and 1513;
in the year of his decease he was, at least nominally, the rector of
Diss.[68]

We are told[69] that for keeping, under the title of a concubine, a
woman whom he had secretly married, Skelton was called to account,
and suspended from his ministerial functions by his diocesan, the
bloody-minded and impure Richard Nykke (or Nix),[70] at the instigation
of the friars, chiefly the Dominicans, whom the poet had severely
handled in his writings. It is said, too, that by this woman he
had several children, and that on his death-bed he declared that he
conscientiously regarded her as his wife, but that such had been his
cowardliness, that he chose rather to confess adultery (concubinage) than
what was then reckoned more criminal in an ecclesiastic,—marriage.

It has been supposed that Skelton was curate of Trumpington near
Cambridge[71] (celebrated as the scene of Chaucer’s _Milleres Tale_),
because at the end of one of his smaller poems are the following words:

    “Auctore Skelton, rectore de Dis.

    Finis, &c. Apud Trumpinton scriptum[72] per Curatum ejusdem,
    quinto die Januarii Anno Domini, secundum computat. Angliæ,
    MDVII.”[73]

But the meaning evidently is, that the curate of Trumpington had written
out the verses composed by the rector of Diss; and that the former had
borrowed them from the latter for the purpose of transcription, is
rendered probable by two lines which occur soon after among some minor
pieces of our author;

  “Hanc volo transcribas, transcriptam moxque remittas
    Pagellam; quia sunt qui mea scripta sciunt.”[74]

Anthony Wood affirms that “at Disse and in the diocese” Skelton “was
esteemed more fit for the stage than the pew or pulpit.”[75] It is at
least certain that anecdotes of the irregularity of his life, of his
buffoonery as a preacher, &c. &c. were current long after his decease,
and gave rise to that tissue of extravagant figments which was put
together for the amusement of the vulgar, and entitled the _Merie Tales
of Skelton_.[76]

Churchyard informs us that Skelton’s “talke was as he wraet [wrote];”[77]
and in this propensity to satire, as well in conversation as in writing,
originated perhaps those quarrels with Garnesche, Barclay, Gaguin, and
Lily, which I have now to notice.

As the four poems _Against Garnesche_ were composed “by the kynges most
noble commaundement,” we may conclude that the monarch found amusement
in the angry rhymes with which Skelton overwhelmed his opponent.
Garnesche, it appears, was the challenger in this contest;[78] and
it is to be regretted that his verses have perished, because in all
probability they would have thrown some light on the private history of
Skelton. _The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy_[79] bears a considerable
resemblance to the verses against Garnesche; but the two Scottish poets
are supposed to have carried on a sportive warfare of rude raillery,
while a real animosity seems to have existed between our author and his
adversary.[80] At the time of this quarrel (the exact date of which
cannot be determined) Christopher Garnesche was gentleman-usher to Henry
the Eighth, and dignified with knighthood;[81] and (if Skelton may be
credited) had risen from the performance of very menial offices to the
station which he then occupied. As he had no claims on the remembrance
of posterity, little is known concerning him; but since we have
evidence that his services were called for on more than one occasion of
importance, he must have been a person of considerable note. He is twice
incidentally mentioned in connexion with the royal sisters of Henry the
Eighth. In 1514, when the Princess Mary embarked for France, in order to
join her decrepit bridegroom Louis the Twelfth, Garnesche formed one of
the numerous retinue selected to attend her, and had an opportunity of
particularly distinguishing himself during that perilous voyage: “The
ii. daye of October at the hower of foure of the clocke in the morenynge
thys fayre ladye tooke her ship with all her noble compaignie: and when
they had sayled a quarter of the see, the wynde rose and seuered some
of the shyppes to Caleys, and some in Flaunders, and her shippe with
greate difficultie was brought to Bulleyn, and with great ieopardy at the
entryng of the hauen, for the master ran the ship hard on shore, but the
botes were redy and receyued this noble lady, and at the landyng _Sir
Christopher Garnyshe_ stode in the water, and toke her in his armes, and
so caryed her to land, where the Duke of Vandosme and a Cardynall with
many estates receyued her and her ladyes,”[82] &c. Again, in a letter,
dated Harbottle 18th Oct. 1515, from Lord Dacre of Gillesland and T.
Magnus to Henry the Eighth, concerning the confinement in childbed
of Margaret widow of James the Fourth, &c. we find; “_Sir Christofer
Garneis_ came to Morpeth immediatly vpon the queneis delyueraunce, and
by our aduice hath contynued there with suche stuff as your grace hath
sent to the said quene your suster till Sondaye laste paste, whiche daye
he delyuered your letter and disclosed your credence, gretely to the
quenes comforte. And for somiche as the quene lieth as yet in childe
bedde, and shall kepe her chambre these thre wookes at the leiste, we
haue aduised the said _sir Christofer Garneis_ to remaigne at Morpeth
till the queneis comyng thidder, and then her grace may order and prepare
euery parte of the said stuf after her pleasure and as her grace semeth
moste conuenient,” &c.[83] A few particulars concerning Garnesche may be

see above: this entry is several times repeated, and occurs for the last

Bale mentions among the writings of Alexander Barclay a piece “against
Skelton.”[92] It has not come down to us; but the extant works of
Barclay bear testimony to the hearty dislike with which he regarded our
author. At the conclusion of _The Ship of Fooles_ is this contemptuous
notice of one of Skelton’s most celebrated poems;

  “Holde me excused, for why my will is good,
  Men to induce vnto vertue and goodnes;
  I write no ieste ne tale of Robin Hood,
  Nor sowe no sparkles ne sede of viciousnes;
  Wise men loue vertue, wilde people wantonnes;
  It longeth not to my science nor cunning,
  _For Philip the Sparow the Dirige to singe_:”[93]

a sneer to which Skelton most probably alludes, when, enumerating his own
productions in the _Garlande of Laurell_, he mentions,

  “Of _Phillip Sparow_ the lamentable fate,
    The dolefull desteny, and the carefull chaunce,
  Dyuysed by Skelton after the funerall rate;
    _Yet sum there be therewith that take greuaunce_,
    _And grudge therat with frownyng countenaunce_;
  But what of that? hard it is to please all men;
  Who list amende it, let hym set to his penne.”[94]

That a portion of the following passage in Barclay’s _Fourth Egloge_ was
levelled at Skelton, appears highly probable;

  “Another thing yet is greatly more damnable:
  Of rascolde poetes yet is a shamfull rable,
  Which voyde of wisedome presumeth to indite,
  Though they haue scantly the cunning of a snite;[95]
  And to what vices that princes moste intende,
  Those dare these fooles solemnize and commende.
  Then is he decked as _Poete laureate_,
  When stinking Thais made him her graduate:
  When Muses rested, she did her season note,
  And she with Bacchus her camous[96] did promote.
  Such rascolde drames, promoted by Thais,
  Bacchus, Licoris, or yet by Testalis,
  Or by suche other newe forged Muses nine,
  Thinke in their mindes for to haue wit diuine;
  They laude their verses, they boast, they vaunt and iet,
  Though all their cunning be scantly worth a pet:
  If they haue smelled the artes triuiall,
  They count them Poetes hye and heroicall.
  Such is their foly, so foolishly they dote,
  Thinking that none can their playne errour note:
  Yet be they foolishe, auoyde of honestie,
  Nothing seasoned with spice of grauitie,
  Auoyde of pleasure, auoyde of eloquence,
  With many wordes, and fruitlesse of sentence;
  Unapt to learne, disdayning to be taught,
  Their priuate pleasure in snare hath them so caught;
  And worst yet of all, they count them excellent,
  Though they be fruitlesse, rashe and improuident.
  To such ambages who doth their minde incline,
  They count all other as priuate[97] of doctrine,
  And that the faultes which be in them alone,
  Also be common in other men eche one.”[98]

In the _Garlande of Laurell_ we are told by Skelton, that among the
famous writers of all ages and nations, whom he beheld in his vision, was

  “a frere of Fraunce men call _sir Gagwyne_,
    That frownyd on me full angerly and pale;”[99]

and in the catalogue of his own writings which is subsequently given in
the same poem, he mentions a piece which he had composed against this
personage,

  “_The Recule ageinst Gaguyne_ of the Frenshe nacyoun.”[100]

Robert Gaguin was minister-general of the Maturines, and enjoyed great
reputation for abilities and learning.[101] He wrote various works; the
most important of which is his _Compendium supra Francorum gestis_ from
the time of Pharamond to the author’s age. In 1490 he was sent by Charles
the Eighth as ambassador to England, where he probably became personally
acquainted with Skelton.

That Skelton composed certain Latin verses against the celebrated
grammarian William Lily, we are informed by Bale,[102] who has preserved
the initial words, viz.

  “Urgeor impulsus tibi, Lilli, retundere:”

and that Lily repaid our poet in kind, we have the following proof;

_“Lilii Hendecasyllabi in Scheltonum ejus carmina calumniantem._[103]

  “Quid me, Scheltone, fronte sic aperta
  Carpis, vipereo potens veneno?
  Quid versus trutina meos iniqua
  Libras? dicere vera num licebit?
  Doctrinæ tibi dum parare famam
  Et doctus fieri studes poeta,
  Doctrinam nec habes, nec es poeta.”

It would seem that Skelton occasionally repented of the severity of
his compositions, and longed to recall them; for in the _Garlande of
Laurell_, after many of them have been enumerated, we meet with the
following curious passage;

    “Item _Apollo that whirllid up his chare_,
  That made sum to snurre and snuf in the wynde;
    It made them to skip, to stampe, and to stare,
    Whiche, if they be happy, haue cause to beware
  In ryming and raylyng with hym for to mell,
  For drede that he lerne them there A, B, C, to spell.

  With that I stode vp, halfe sodenly afrayd;
    Suppleyng to Fame, I besought her grace,
  _And that it wolde please her, full tenderly I prayd_,
    _Owt of her bokis Apollo to rase_.
    Nay, sir, she sayd, what so in this place
  Of our noble courte is ones spoken owte,
  It must nedes after rin all the worlde aboute.

  _God wote, theis wordes made me full sad_;
    And when that I sawe it wolde no better be,
  But that my peticyon wolde not be had,
    What shulde I do but take it in gre?
    For, by Juppiter and his high mageste,
  _I did what I cowde to scrape out the scrollis_,
  _Apollo to rase out of her ragman rollis_.”[104]

The piece which commenced with the words “Apollo that whirllid vp his
chare,” and which gave such high displeasure to some of Skelton’s
contemporaries, has long ago perished,—in spite of Fame’s refusal to
erase it from her books!

The title-page of the _Garlande of Laurell_,[105] ed. 1523, sets forth
that it was “studyously dyuysed _at Sheryfhotton Castell_,” in Yorkshire;
and there seems no reason to doubt that it was written by Skelton during
a residence at that mansion. The date of its composition is unknown;
but it was certainly produced at an advanced period of his life;[106]
and the Countess of Surrey, who figures in it so conspicuously as his
patroness, must have been Elizabeth Stafford, daughter of Edward Duke
of Buckingham, second wife of Thomas Howard Earl of Surrey, and mother
of that illustrious Surrey “whose fame for aye endures.” Sheriff-Hutton
Castle was then in the possession of her father-in-law, the Duke of
Norfolk,[107] the victor of Flodden Field; and she was probably there
as his guest, having brought Skelton in her train. Of this poem,
unparalleled for its egotism, the greater part is allegorical; but the
incident from which it derives its name,—the weaving of a garland for the
author by a party of ladies, at the desire of the Countess, seems to have
had some foundation in fact.

From a passage in the poem just mentioned, we may presume that Skelton
used sometimes to reside at the ancient college of the Bonhommes at
Ashridge;

  “Of the Bonehoms of Ashrige besyde Barkamstede,
    _That goodly place to Skelton moost kynde_,
  Where the sank royall is, Crystes blode so rede,
    Whervpon he metrefyde after his mynde;
    A pleasaunter place than Ashrige is, harde were to fynde,” &c.[108]

That Skelton once enjoyed the patronage of Wolsey, at whose desire he
occasionally exercised his pen, and from whose powerful influence he
expected preferment in the church, we learn from the following passages
in his works:

    “Honorificatissimo, amplissimo, longeque reverendissimo in
    Christo patri, ac domino, domino Thomæ, &c. tituli sanctæ
    Ceciliæ, sacrosanctæ Romanæ ecclesiæ presbytero, Cardinali
    meritissimo, et apostolicæ sedis legato, a latereque legato
    superillustri, &c. Skeltonis laureatus, ora. reg., humillimum
    dicit obsequium cum omni debita reverentia, tanto tamque
    magnifico digna principe sacerdotum, totiusque justitiæ
    æquabilissimo moderatore, necnon præsentis opusculi fautore
    excellentissimo, &c., ad cujus auspicatissimam contemplationem,
    sub memorabili prelo gloriosæ immortalitatis, præsens pagella
    felicitatur, &c.”[109]

    “Ad serenissimam Majestatem Regiam, pariter cum Domino
    Cardinali, Legato a latere honorificatissimo, &c.

      _Lautre Enuoy._

      Perge, liber, celebrem pronus regem venerare
      Henricum octavum, resonans sua præmia laudis.
      Cardineum dominum pariter venerando salutes,
      Legatum a latere, et fiat memor ipse precare
      Prebendæ, quam promisit mihi credere quondam,
      Meque suum referas pignus sperare salutis
      Inter spemque metum.

      Twene hope and drede
      My lyfe I lede,
      But of my spede
          Small sekernes;
      Howe be it I rede
      Both worde and dede
      Should be agrede
          In noblenes:
      Or els, &c.”[110]

    “To my Lorde Cardynals right noble grace, &c.

      _Lenuoy._

      Go, lytell quayre, apace,
        In moost humble wyse,
      Before his noble grace,
        That caused you to deuise
        This lytel enterprise;
      And hym moost lowly pray,
        In his mynde to comprise
      Those wordes his grace dyd saye
      Of an ammas gray.
      _Ie foy enterment en sa bone grace_.”[111]

We also find that Skelton “gaue to my lord Cardynall” _The Boke of Three
Fooles_.[112]

What were the circumstances which afterwards alienated the poet from his
powerful patron, cannot now be discovered: we only know that Skelton
assailed the full-blown pride of Wolsey with a boldness which is
astonishing, and with a fierceness of invective which has seldom been
surpassed. Perhaps, it would have been better for the poet’s memory, if
the passages just quoted had never reached us; but nothing unfavourable
to his character ought to be hastily inferred from the alteration in
his feelings towards Wolsey while the cause of their quarrel is buried
in obscurity. The provocation must have been extraordinary, which
transformed the humble client of the Cardinal into his “dearest foe.”

We are told by Francis Thynne, that Wolsey was his father’s “olde enymye,
for manye causes, but mostly for that my father had furthered Skelton to
publishe his _Collin Cloute_ againste the Cardinall, the moste parte of
whiche Booke was compiled in my fathers howse at Erithe in Kente.”[113]
But though _Colyn Cloute_ contains passages which manifestly point at
Wolsey, it cannot be termed a piece “_againste the Cardinall:_” and
I have no doubt that the poem which Thynne had in view, and which by
mistake he has mentioned under a wrong title, was our author’s _Why come
ye nat to Courte_. In _Colyn Cloute_ Skelton ventured to aim only a few
shafts at Wolsey: in _Why come ye nat to Courte_, and in _Speke, Parrot_,
he let loose against him the full asperity of reproach.

The bull appointing Wolsey and Campeggio to be Legates _a latere_
jointly, is dated July 27th, 1518, that appointing Wolsey to be sole
Legate _a latere_, 10th June, 1519;[114] and from the first two passages
which I have cited above (pp. xl, xli) we ascertain the fact, that Wolsey
continued to be the patron of Skelton for at least some time after he
had been invested with the dignity of papal legate. If the third passage
cited above (p. xli), “Go, lytell quayre, apace,” &c. really belong to
the poem _How the douty Duke of Albany_, &c., to which it is appended
in Marshe’s ed. of Skelton’s _Workes_, 1568, our author must have been
soliciting Wolsey for preferment as late as November 1523: but his most
direct satire on the Cardinal, _Why come ye nat to Courte_, was evidently
composed anterior to that period; and his _Speke, Parrot_ (which would
require the scholia of a Tzetzes to render it intelligible) contains
seeming allusions to events of a still earlier date. The probability (or
rather certainty) is, that the L’Envoy, “Go, lytell quayre,” &c. has no
connexion with the poem on the Duke of Albany: in Marshe’s volume the
various pieces are thrown together without any attempt at arrangement;
and it ought to be particularly noticed that between the poem against
Albany and the L’Envoy in question, _another L’Envoy is interposed_.[115]
Wolsey might have forgiven the allusions made to him in _Colyn Cloute_;
but it would be absurd to imagine that, in 1523, he continued to
patronise the man who had written _Why come ye nat to Courte_.

The following anecdote is subjoined from Hall: “And in this season
[15 Henry viii.], the Cardinall by his power legantine dissolued the
Conuocacion at Paules, called by the Archebishop of Cantorbury [Warham],
and called hym and all the clergie to his conuocacion to Westminster,
which was neuer seen before in Englande, wherof master Skelron, a mery
Poet, wrote,

  Gentle Paule, laie doune thy sweard,[116]
  For Peter of Westminster hath shauen thy beard.”[117]

From the vengeance of the Cardinal,[118] who had sent out officers
to apprehend him, Skelton took sanctuary at Westminster, where he was
kindly received and protected by the abbot Islip,[119] with whom he
had been long acquainted. In this asylum he appears to have remained
till his death, which happened June 21st, 1529. What he is reported
to have declared on his death-bed concerning the woman whom he had
secretly married, and by whom he left several children, has been already
mentioned:[120] he is said also to have uttered at the same time a
prophecy concerning the downfal of Wolsey.[121] He was buried in the
chancel of the neighbouring church of St. Margaret’s; and, soon after,
this inscription was placed over his grave,

    _Joannes Skeltonus, vates Pierius, hic situs est_.[122]

Concerning the personal appearance of Skelton we are left in
ignorance;[123] for the portraits which are prefixed to the old editions
of several of his poems must certainly not be received as authentic
representations of the author.[124]

The chief satirical productions of Skelton (and the bent of his genius
was decidedly towards satire) are _The Bowge of Courte_, _Colyn Cloute_,
and _Why come ye nat to Courte_.—In the first of these, an allegorical
poem of considerable invention, he introduces a series of characters
delineated with a boldness and discrimination which no preceding poet had
displayed since the days of Chaucer, and which none of his contemporaries
(with the sole exception of the brilliant Dunbar) were able to attain:
the merit of those personifications has been allowed even by Warton,
whose ample critique on Skelton deals but little in praise;[125] and I
am somewhat surprised that Mr. D’Israeli, who has lately come forward as
the warm eulogist of our author,[126] should have passed over _The Bowge
of Courte_ without the slightest notice.—_Colyn Cloute_ is a general
satire on the corruptions of the Church, the friars and the bishops being
attacked alike unsparingly; nor, when Skelton himself pronounced of this
piece that “though his ryme be ragged, it hath in it some pyth,”[127] did
he overrate its vigour and its weighty truth: _Colyn Cloute_ not only
shews that fearlessness which on all occasions distinguished him, but
evinces a superiority to the prejudices of his age, in assailing abuses,
which, if manifest to his more enlightened contemporaries, few at least
had as yet presumed to censure.—In _Why come ye nat to Courte_ the satire
is entirely personal, and aimed at the all-powerful minister to whom
the author had once humbly sued for preferment. While, throughout this
remarkable poem, Skelton either overlooks or denies the better qualities,
the commanding talents, and the great attainments of Wolsey, and even
ungenerously taunts him with the meanness of his origin; he fails not to
attack his character and conduct in those particulars against which a
satirist might justly declaim, and with the certainty that invectives so
directed would find an echo among the people. The regal pomp and luxury
of the Cardinal, his insatiate ambition, his insolent bearing at the
council-board, his inaccessibility to suitors, &c. &c. are dwelt on with
an intensity of scornful bitterness, and occasionally give rise to vivid
descriptions which history assures us are but little exaggerated. Some
readers may perhaps object, that in this poem the satire of Skelton too
much resembles the “oyster-knife that hacks and hews” (to which that of
Pope was so unfairly likened[128]); but all must confess that he wields
his weapon with prodigious force and skill; and we know that Wolsey
writhed under the wounds which it inflicted.

When Catullus bewailed the death of Lesbia’s bird, he confined himself to
eighteen lines (and truly golden lines); but Skelton, while lamenting for
the sparrow that was “slayn at Carowe,” has engrafted on the subject so
many far-sought and whimsical embellishments, that his epicede is really
what the old editions term it,—a “boke.” _Phyllyp Sparowe_ exhibits such
fertility and delicacy of fancy, such graceful sportiveness, and such
ease of expression, that it might well be characterised by Coleridge as
“an exquisite and original poem.”[129]

In _The Tunnyng of Elynour Rummyng_, which would seem to have been one of
Skelton’s most popular performances, we have a specimen of his talent for
the low burlesque;—a description of a real ale-wife, and of the various
gossips who keep thronging to her for liquor, as if under the influence
of a spell. If few compositions of the kind have more coarseness or
extravagance, there are few which have greater animation or a richer
humour.

The _Garlands of Laurell_, one of Skelton’s longest and most elaborate
pieces, cannot also be reckoned among his best. It contains, however,
several passages of no mean beauty, which shew that he possessed powers
for the higher kind of poetry, if he had chosen to exercise them; and
is interspersed with some lyrical addresses to the ladies who weave his
chaplet, which are very happily versified. In one respect the _Garlande
of Laurell_ stands without a parallel: the history of literature affords
no second example of a poet having deliberately written sixteen hundred
lines in honour of himself.

Skelton is to be regarded as one of the fathers of the English drama. His
_Enterlude of Vertue_[130] and his _Comedy callyd Achademios_[131] have
perished; so perhaps has his _Nigramansir_;[132] but his _Magnyfycence_
is still extant. To those who carry their acquaintance with our early
play-wrights no farther back than the period of Peele, Greene, and
Marlowe, this “goodly interlude” by Skelton will doubtless appear heavy
and inartificial; its superiority, however, to the similar efforts of his
contemporaries, is, I apprehend, unquestionable.[133]

If our author did not invent the metre which he uses in the greater
portion of his writings, and which is now known by the name
_Skeltonical_, he was certainly the first who adopted it in poems of any
length; and he employed it with a skill, which, after he had rendered
it popular, was beyond the reach of his numerous imitators.[134] “The
Skeltonical short verse,” observes Mr. D’Israeli, speaking of Skelton’s
own productions, “contracted into five or six, and even four syllables,
is wild and airy. In the quick-returning rhymes, the playfulness of
the diction, and the pungency of new words, usually ludicrous, often
expressive, and sometimes felicitous, there is a stirring spirit which
will be best felt in an audible reading. The velocity of his verse has a
carol of its own. The chimes ring in the ear, and the thoughts are flung
about like coruscations.”[135]

Skelton has been frequently termed a Macaronic poet, but it may be
doubted if with strict propriety; for the passages in which he introduces
snatches of Latin and French are thinly scattered through his works.
“This anomalous and motley mode of versification,” says Warton, “is, I
believe, supposed to be peculiar to our author. I am not, however, quite
certain that it originated with Skelton.”[136] He ought to have been
“quite certain” that it did _not_.[137]

[15] Sometimes written _Schelton_: and Blomefield says, “That his Name
was _Shelton_ or Skelton, appears from his Successor’s Institution, viz.
‘1529, 17 July, Thomas Clerk, instituted on the Death of John _Shelton_,
last Rector [Lib. Inst. No. 18].’” _Hist. of Norfolk_, i. 20. ed. 1739.

[16] “John Skelton was a younger branch of the Skeltons of Skelton
in this County [Cumberland]. I crave leave of the Reader, (hitherto
not having full instructions, and) preserving the undoubted Title of
this County unto him, to defer his character to Norfolk, where he was
Beneficed at Diss therein.” Fuller’s _Worthies_, p. 221 (_Cumberland_),
ed. 1662. “John Skelton is placed in this County [Norfolk] on a double
probability. First, because an ancient family of his name is eminently
known long fixed therein. Secondly, because he was beneficed at Dis,”
&c. _Id._ p. 257 (_Norfolk_).—“John Skelton ... was originally, if not
nearly, descended from the Skeltons of Cumberland.” Wood’s _Ath. Oxon._
i. 49. ed. Bliss. See also Tanner’s _Biblioth._ p. 675. ed. 1748.—“I
take it, that Skelton was not only Rector, but a Native of this Place
[Diss], being son of William Skelton, and Margaret his Wife, whose Will
was proved at Norwich, Nov. 7, 1512 [Regr. Johnson].” Blomefield’s _Hist.
of Norfolk_, i. 20. ed. 1739. Through the active kindness of Mr. Amyot,
I have received a copy of the Will of William Skelton (or Shelton), who,
though perhaps a relation, was surely not the father of the poet; for in
this full and explicit document the name of _John_ Skelton does not once
occur.—From an entry which will be afterwards cited, it would seem that
the Christian name of Skelton’s mother was Johanna.—In Skelton’s Latin
lines on the city of Norwich (see vol. i. 174) we find,

  “Ah decus, ah _patriæ_ specie pulcherrima dudum!
    Urbs Norvicensis,” &c.

Does “_patriæ_” mean his native county?

[17] “Having been educated in this university, as Joh. Baleus attests.”
Wood’s _Ath. Oxon._ i. 50. ed. Bliss. Wood’s reference in the note is
“In lib. _De Scriptoribus Anglicis_, MS. inter cod. MSS. Selden, in bib.
Bodl. p. 69 b.” The printed copy of Bale’s work contains no mention of
the place of Skelton’s education. Part of Bale’s information concerning
Skelton, as appears from the still extant MS. collections for his
_Script. Illust. Brit._, was received “Ex Guilhelmo Horman,” the author
of the _Vulgaria_.—See also Tanner’s _Biblioth._ p. 675. ed. 1748.—Warton
says that Skelton “studied in both our universities.” _Hist. of E. P._
ii. 336. ed. 4to.

[18] _A Replycacion_, &c. vol. i. 207.

[19] “Wood reckons him of Ox. on the author. of Bale in a MS. in the
Bodleian Libr., but with much better reason he may be called ours; for
I find one Scheklton M.A. in the year 1484, at which time allowing
him to be 24 years of age, he must be at his death A.D. 1529, 68 or
69 years old, which ’tis probable he might be. v. Bale 653.” Cole’s
_Collections_,—_Add. MSS._ (Brit. Mus.) 5880, p. 199.

[20] I suspect that, during Skelton’s lifetime, two of his most
celebrated pieces, _Colyn Cloute_ (see v. 1239, vol. i. 359), and _Why
come ye nat to Courte_, were not committed to the press, but wandered
about in manuscript among hundreds of eager readers. A portion of _Speke,
Parrot_, and the Poems _Against Garnesche_, are now for the first time
printed.

[21] Vol. i. 408 sqq. No poetical antiquary can read the titles of some
of the lighter pieces mentioned in that catalogue,—such as _The Balade
of the Mustarde Tarte_, _The Murnyng of the mapely rote_ (see Notes,
vol. ii. 330), &c.—without regretting their loss. “Many of the songs or
popular ballads of this time,” observes Sir John Hawkins, “appear to have
been written by Skelton.” _Hist. of Music_, iii. 39.

I take the present opportunity of giving from a MS. in my possession
a much fuller copy than has hitherto appeared of the celebrated song
which opens the second act of _Gammer Gurtons Nedle_, and which Warton
calls “the first _chanson à boire_ or _drinking-ballad_, of any merit,
in our language.” _Hist. of E. P._ iii. 206. ed. 4to. The comedy was
first printed in 1575: the manuscript copy of the song, as follows, is
certainly of an earlier date:

  “backe & syde goo bare goo bare

[24] He was only eleven years old at his father’s death. See more
concerning the fifth earl in Percy’s Preface to _The Northumberland
Household Book_, 1770, in Warton’s _Hist. of E. P._ ii. 338. ed. 4to,
and in Collins’s _Peerage_, ii. 304. ed. Brydges.—Warton says that the
Earl “encouraged Skelton to write this Elegy,” an assertion grounded, I
suppose, on the Latin lines prefixed to it.

[25] A splendid MS. volume, consisting of poems (chiefly by Lydgate),
finely written on vellum, and richly illuminated, which formerly belonged
to the fifth earl, is still preserved in the British Museum, _MS. Reg.
18. D ii._: at fol. 165 is Skelton’s Elegy on the earl’s father.

[26] For a notice of Skelton’s laureation at Oxford, the Rev. Dr. Bliss
obligingly searched the archives of that university, but without success:
“no records,” he informs me, “remain between 1463 and 1498 that will give
a correct list of degrees.”

[27] This work (a thin folio), translated by Caxton from the French, is
a prose romance founded on the _Æneid_. It consists of 65 chapters, the
first entitled “How the ryght puyssant kynge pryamus edyfyed the grete
Cyte of Troye,” the last, “How Ascanyus helde the royalme of Ytalye
after the dethe of Eneas hys fader.” Gawin Douglas, in the Preface to
his translation of Virgil’s poem, makes a long and elaborate attack on
Caxton’s performance;

  “Wylliame Caxtoun had no compatioun
  Of Virgill in that buk he preȳt in prois,
  Clepand it Virgill in Eneados,
  Quhilk that he sayis of Frensche he did translate;
  It has na thing ado therwith, God wate,
  Nor _na mare like than the Deuil and sanct Austin_,” &c.

  Sig. B iii. ed. 1553.

[28] A work probably never printed, and now lost: it is mentioned by
Skelton in the _Garlande of Laurell_;

  “Of _Tullis Familiars_ the translacyoun.”

  “_Diodorus Siculus_ of my translacyon

  Who redyth it ones wolde rede it agayne;

refuge in France.

[39] A gentleman resident at Louvaine obligingly examined for me the
registers of that university, but could find in them no mention of
Skelton.

[40] The original has “Cum:” but the initial letters of the lines were
intended to form a distich; see the conclusion of the poem.

write history, they sometimes say odd things: e. g. “It is affirmed
that Skelton had been tutor to Henry [viii.] in some department of his
education. _How probable it is_ that the corruption imparted by this
ribald and ill-living wretch laid the foundation for his royal pupil’s
grossest crimes!” _Lives of the Queens of England by Agnes Strickland_,
vol. iv. 104.

[52] Fourth Poem _Against Garnesche_, vol. i. 129.

[53] _Garlande of Laurell_, vol. i. 410.—After noticing that while
Arthur was yet alive, Henry was destined by his father to be archbishop
of Canterbury, “it has been remarked,” says Mrs. Thomson, “that the
instructions bestowed upon Prince Henry by his preceptor, Skelton, were
calculated to render him a scholar and a churchman, rather than an
enlightened legislator.” _Mem. of the Court of Henry the Eighth_, i.
2. But the description of the _Speculum Principis_, quoted above, is
somewhat at variance with such a conclusion. The same lady observes in
another part of her work, “To Skelton, who in conjunction with Giles
Dewes, clerk of the library to Henry the Seventh, had the honour of
being tutor to Henry the Eighth, this king evinced his approbation,”
ii. 590, and cites in a note the Epistle to Henry the Eighth prefixed
to Palsgrave’s _Lesclarcissement de la Langue Francoyse_, 1530, where
mention is made of “the synguler clerke maister Gyles Dewes somtyme
instructour to your noble grace in this selfe tong.” Though Dewes taught
French to Henry, surely it by no means follows that he was “his tutor
in conjunction with Skelton:” a teacher of French and a tutor are very
different.

[54] _Biblioth._ p. 676. ed. 1748.

[55] _Erasmi Opera_, i. 1214, 1216, ed. 1703.—The Ode is appended to
Erasmus’s Latin version of the _Hecuba_ and _Iphigenia in Aulide_ of
Euripides, printed by Aldus in 1507; and in that edition the second line
which I have quoted is found with the following variation,

  “Monstrante fonteis vate _Laurigero_ sacros.”

“It is probable,” says Granger, “that if that great and good man
[Erasmus] had read and perfectly understood his [Skelton’s] ‘pithy,
pleasaunt, and profitable works,’ as they were lately reprinted, he would
have spoken of him in less honourable terms.” _Biog. Hist. of Engl._ i.
102. ed. 1775. The remark is sufficiently foolish: in Skelton’s works
there are not a few passages which Erasmus, himself a writer of admirable
wit, must have relished and admired; and it was not without reason that
he and our poet have been classed together as satirists, in the following
passage; “By what meanes could Skelton that laureat poet, or Erasmus that
great and learned clarke, have vttered their mindes so well at large, as
thorowe their clokes of mery conceytes in wryting of toyes and foolish
theames: as Skelton did by _Speake parrot_, _Ware the hauke_, _the
Tunning of Elynour Rumming_, _Why come ye not to the Courte?_ _Philip
Sparrowe_, and such like: yet what greater sense or better matter can
be, than is in this ragged ryme contayned? Or who would haue hearde his
fault so playnely tolde him, if not in such gibyng sorte? Also Erasmus,
vnder his _prayse of Folly_, what matters hath he touched therein?” &c.

Liter_. vol. i. 382. ed. 1815).

he thus describes, _at the residence of Lord Mounjoy_,” i. 11. ed. 8vo.

[63] According to the xivᵗʰ of the _Merie Tales of Skelton_ (see Appendix
I. to the present Memoir), he was “long confined in prison at Westminster
by the command of the cardinal:” but the tract is of such a nature that
we must hesitate about believing a single statement which it contains.
Even supposing that at some period or other Skelton was really imprisoned
by Wolsey, that imprisonment could hardly have taken place so early as
1502. As far as I can gather from his writings, Skelton first offended
Wolsey by glancing at him in certain passages of _Colyn Cloute_, and in
those passages the cardinal is alluded to as being in the fulness of pomp
and power.

[64] By Writ of Privy Seal—_Auditor’s Calendar of Files from 1485 to
1522_, fol. 101 (b.), in the Public Record Office.

[65] Ritson (_Bibliog. Poet._ p. 102) says that Skelton was “_chaplain_
to king Henry the eighth:” qy. on what authority?

[66] “He ... was Rector and lived here [at Diss] in 1504 and in 1511,
as I find by his being Witness to several Wills in this year. (Note)
1504, The Will of Mary Cowper of Disse, ‘Witnesses Master John Skelton,
Laureat, Parson of Disse, &c.’ And among the Evidences of Mr. Thomas
Coggeshall, I find the House in the Tenure of Master Skelton, Laureat ...
Mr. Le-Neve says, that his [Skelton’s] Institution does not appear in the
Books, which is true, for often those that were collated by the Pope,
had no Institution from the Bishop, many Instances of which in those
Books occur; but it is certain from abundance of Records and Evidences
that I have seen, that he was Rector several years.” Blomefield’s _Hist.
of Norfolk_, i. 20. ed. 1739.—The parish-register of Diss affords no
information concerning Skelton; for the earliest date which it contains
is long posterior to his death.

[67] See _A deuoute trentale for old John Clarke_, who died in 1506,
vol. i. 168; _Lamentatio urbis Norvicen._, written in 1507, p. 174; and

[68] I may notice here, that in an Assessment for a Subsidy, temp. Henry
viii., we find, under “Sancte Helenes Parishe within Bisshoppisgate,”—

    “_Mr Skelton_ in goodes             xl. _li._”

_Books of the Treasury of the Exchequer, B._ 4. 15, fol. 7,—Public Record
Office. Qy. was this our author?

[69] “Cum quibusdam blateronibus fraterculis, præcipue Dominicanis,
bellum gerebat continuum. Sub pseudopontifice Nordouicensi Ricardo Nixo,
mulierem illam, quam sibi secreto ob Antichristi metum desponsauerat,
sub concubinæ titulo custodiebat. In ultimo tamen uitæ articulo super
ea re interrogatus, respondit, se nusquam illam in conscientia coram
Deo nisi pro uxore legitima tenuisse ... animam egit ... relictis
liberis.” Bale, _Script. Illust. Brit._ pp. 651, 2. ed. 1559.—“In
Monachos præsertim Prædicatores S. Dominici sæpe stylum acuit, & terminos
prætergressus modestiæ, contra eos scommatibus acerbius egit. Quo facto
suum exasperauit Episcopum Richardum Nixum, qui habito de vita & moribus
eius examine, deprehendit hominem votam Deo castitatem violasse, imo
concubinam domi suæ diu tenuisse.” Pits, _De Illust. Angl. Script._ p.
701. ed. 1619.—“The Dominican Friars were the next he contested with,
whose vitiousness lay pat enough for his hand; but such foul Lubbers fell
heavy on all which found fault with them. These instigated Nix, Bishop of
Norwich, to call him to account for keeping a Concubine, which cost him
(as it seems) a suspension from his benefice.... We must not forget, how
being charged by some on his death-bed for begetting many children on the
aforesaid Concubine, he protested, that in his Conscience he kept her in
the notion of a wife, though such his cowardliness that he would rather
confess adultery (then accounted but a venial) than own marriage esteemed
a capital crime in that age.” Fuller’s _Worthies_, p. 257 (Norfolk),
ed. 1662.—Anthony Wood, with his usual want of charity towards the sons
of genius, says that Skelton “having been guilty of certain crimes, (as
most poets are,) at least not agreeable to his coat, fell under the
heavy censure of Rich. Nykke bishop of Norwich his diocesan; especially
for his scoffs and ill language against the monks and dominicans in his
writings.” _Ath. Oxon._ i. 50. ed. Bliss, who adds in a note, “Mr. Thomas
Delafield in his MS. _Collection of Poets Laureate_, &c. among Gough’s
MSS. in the Bodleian, says it was in return for his being married, an
equal crime in the ecclesiastics of those days, bishop Nykke suspended
him from his church.”—Tanner gives as one of the reasons for Skelton’s
taking sanctuary at Westminster towards the close of his life, “propter
quod uxorem habuit.” _Biblioth._ p. 675. ed. 1748.—In the xiiiᵗʰ of the
_Merie Tales_ (see Appendix I. to the present Memoir) Skelton’s _wife_ is
mentioned.

[70] “Cui [Nixo] utcunque a nive nomen videatur inditum, adeo nihil erat
nivei in pectore, luxuriosis cogitationibus plurimum æstuante, ut atro
carbone libidines ejus notandæ videantur, si vera sunt quæ de illo a
Nevillo perhibentur.” Godwin _De Præsul. Angl._ p. 440. ed. 1743.

[71] “In the Edition of his Workes _in 8vo. Lond._ 1736, which I have, at
p. 272 he mentions _Trumpinton_, and seems to have been _Curate_ there,
5. Jan. 1507. At p. 54 he also mentions _Swafham_ and _Soham_, 2 Towns in
_Cambridgeshire_, in _The Crowne of Lawrell_.” Cole’s _Collections,—Add.
MSS._ (Brit. Mus.) 5880, p. 199. To conclude from the mention of these
towns that Skelton resided in Cambridgeshire is the height of absurdity,
as the reader will immediately perceive on turning to the passage in
question, _Garlande of Laurell_, v. 1416, vol. i. 417.—Chalmers, on the
authority of a MS. note by Kennet, a transcript of which had been sent
to him, states that “in 1512, Skelton was presented by Richard, abbot of
Glastonbury, to the vicarage of Daltyng.” _Biog. Dict._ xxviii. 45: if
Chalmers had consulted Wood’s account of the poet, he might have learned
that the rector of Diss and the vicar of Dultyng were different persons.

[78] “Sithe ye haue me chalyngyd, M[aster] Garnesche,” &c.; see vol. i.
116.

[79] In the Notes on the poems _Against Garnesche_ I have cited several
parallel expressions from _The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy_. That
curious production may be found in the valuable edition of Dunbar’s
_Poems_ (ii. 65) by Mr. D. Laing, who supposes it to have been written
between 1492 and 1497 (ii. 420). It therefore preceded the “flyting” of
Skelton and Garnesche. I may add, that the last portion of our author’s
_Speke, Parrot_ bears a considerable resemblance to a copy of verses
attributed to Dunbar, and entitled _A General Satyre_ (_Poems_, ii. 24);
and that as the great Scottish poet visited England more than once, it is
probable that he and Skelton were personally acquainted.

[80] At a later period there was a poetical “flyting” between Churchyard
and a person named Camel, who had attacked a publication of the former
called _Davie Dicars Dreame_; and some other writers took a part in the
controversy: these rare pieces (known only by their titles to Ritson,
_Bibliog. Poet._ p. 151, and to Chalmers, _Life of Churchyard_, p. 53)
are very dull and pointless, but were evidently put forth in earnest.

[81] In the first poem _Against Garnesche_ he is called _“Master_:” but
see Notes, vol. ii. 177.

    “Pleas it your grace, We haue Receyued the Kyngs most graciouse

In _Proceed. and Ordin. of the Privy Council_ (vol. vii. 183, 196),
1541, mention is made of a _Lady Garnishe_ (probably the widow of Sir
Christopher) having had a house at Calais; and in _Privy Purse Expenses
of the Princess Mary_ (p. 120) we find under June 1543,

    “Item my _lady garnyshe_ seruaunt for bringing cherys    xii _d._”

[101] In a volume of various pieces by Gaguin, dated 1498, is a treatise

[102] “_Inuectiuam In Guil. Lilium, Lib._ i.” _Script. Illust. Brit._,
&c. p. 652. ed. 1559. The reader must not suppose from the description,
“Lib. i.,” that the invective in question extended to a volume: it was,
I presume, no more than a copy of verses. Wood mentions that this piece
was “written in verse and very carping.” _Ath. Ox._ i. 52. ed. Bliss:
but most probably he was acquainted with it only through Bale. He also
informs us (i. 34) that Lily wrote a tract entitled

    “_Apologia ad_ { _Joh. Skeltonum._
                   { _Rob. Whittington._”

for a copy of which I have sought in vain.

[103] See Weever’s _Fun. Monum._ p. 498. ed. 1631; Stowe’s Collections,
_MS. Harl._ 540. fol. 57; and Fuller’s _Worthies_ (_Norfolk_), p. 257.
ed. 1662. “And this,” says Fuller, “I will do for W. Lilly, (though often
beaten for his sake,) endeavour to translate his answer:

  “With face so bold, and teeth so sharp,
  Of viper’s venome, why dost carp?
  Why are my verses by thee weigh’d
  In a false scale? may truth be said?
  Whilst thou to get the more esteem
  A learned Poet fain wouldst seem,
  Skelton, thou art, let all men know it,
  Neither learned, nor a Poet.”

_Replycacion_ is described and quoted from Heber’s copy, we are told
that it has “a Latin address to Thomas —— who [_sic_] he [Skelton] calls
an excellent patron,” &c. That the editor should have read the address
without discovering that the said _Thomas_ was Cardinal Wolsey, is truly
marvellous.

[110] _Garlande of Laurell_, vol. i. 424.

[111] See vol. ii. 83, where this _Lenuoy_ (which will be more
particularly noticed presently) is appended to the poem _Howe the douty

[113] _Animadversions vppon the annotacions and correctōns of some

I may notice here, that among the _Harleian MSS._ (2252, fols. 156, 158)
are two poems on the Cardinal, which in the Catalogue of that collection
Wanley has described as “Skelton’s libels;” but they are evidently not by
him.

[114] Wolsey had previously been named a Cardinal in 1515.—Fiddes (_Life
of Wolsey_, p. 99. ed. 1726) says that he became Legate _a latere_ in
1516: but see _State Papers_ (1830), i. 9 (note). Lingard’s _Hist. of
Engl._ vi. 57. ed. 8vo, &c.—Hoping to ascertain the exact date of the
_Replycacion_, &c. (which contains the first of the passages now under
consideration), I have consulted various books for some mention of the
“young hereticks” against whom that piece was written; but without
success.

[115] We cannot settle this point by a comparison of old editions, the
poem against Albany and the two L’Envoys which follow it being extant
only in the ed. of Marshe.—It may be doubted, too, if the L’Envoy which
I have cited at p. xli, “_Perge, liber_,” &c. belongs to the _Garlande
of Laurell_, to which it is affixed in Marshe’s edition as a _second_
L’Envoy: in Faukes’s edition of that poem, which I conceive to be the
first that was printed, it is not found: the Cott. MS. of the _Garlande_
is unfortunately imperfect at the end.

[118] “Ob literas quasdam in Cardinalem Vuolsium inuectiuas, ad
Vuestmonasteriense tandem asylum confugere, pro uita seruanda, coactus
fuit: ubi nihilominus sub abbate Islepo fauorem inuenit.” Bale, _Script.
Illust. Brit._ p. 651. ed. 1559.—“Vbi licet Abbatis Islepi fauore
protegeretur, tamen vitam ibi, quantumuis antea iucunde actam, tristi
exitu conclusit.” Pits, _De Illust. Angl. Script._ p. 701. ed. 1619.—“But
Cardinal Wolsey (_impar congressus_, betwixt a poor Poet and so potent
a Prelate) being inveighed against by his pen, and charged with too
much truth, so persecuted him, that he was forced to take Sanctuary at
Westminster, where Abbot Islip used him with much respect,” &c. Fuller’s
_Worthies_ (_Norfolk_), p. 257. ed. 1662.—“He [Skelton] was so closely
pursued by his [Wolsey’s] officers, that he was forced to take sanctuary
at Westminster, where he was kindly entertained by John Islipp the abbat,
and continued there to the time of his death.” Wood’s _Ath. Oxon._ i.
51. ed. Bliss, who adds in a note; “The original MS. register of this
sanctuary, which must have been a great curiosity, was in Sir Henry
Spelman’s library, and was purchased at the sale of that collection
by Wanley for Lord Weymouth. MS. note in Wanley’s copy of Nicholson’s
_Historical Library_ in the Bodleian.”

[119] John Islip was elected abbot in 1500, and died in 1532: see
Widmore’s _Hist. of West. Abbey_, 119, 123. “John Skelton ... is said
by the late learned Bishop of Derry, Nicholson (_Hist. Lib._ chap. 2.)
to have first collected the Epitaphs of our Kings, Princes, and Nobles,
that lie buried at the Abbey Church of Westminster: but I apprehend
this to be no otherwise true, than that, when he, to avoid the anger
of Cardinal Wolsey, had taken sanctuary at Westminster, to recommend
himself to Islip, the Abbot at that time, he made some copies of verses
to the memories of King Henry the Seventh and his Queen, and his mother
the Countess of Richmond, and perhaps some other persons buried in this
church.” _Account of Writers_, &c., p. 5, appended to Widmore’s _Enquiry
into the time of the found. of West. Abbey_.—Widmore is mistaken: neither
in Marshe’s ed. of Skelton’s _Workes_, 1568, nor in the _Reges, Reginæ,
Nobiles_, &c., 1603, is there any copy of verses by our author _on the
Queen of Henry the Seventh_: see in vol. i. 178, 179, 195, the three
pieces which I have given from those sources: two of them at least were
composed before the poet had sought refuge at Westminster, for one
(written at Islip’s request) is dated 1512, and another, 1516; the third
has no date.

[120] See p. xxix.

[121] “De morte Cardinalis uaticinium edidit: & eius ueritatem euentus
declarauit.” Bale, _Script. Illust. Brit._ p. 652. ed. 1559.—“The
word _Vates_ being Poet or Prophet, minds me of this dying Skeltons
prediction, foretelling the ruine of Cardinal Wolsey. Surely, one
unskilled in prophecies, if well versed in Solomons Proverbs, might have
prognosticated as much, that _Pride goeth before a fall_.” Fuller’s
_Worthies_ (_Norfolk_), p. 257. ed. 1662.—Did not this anecdote originate
in certain verses of _Cotyn Cloute_? See the fragment from _Lansdown
MSS._, vol. i. 329, note.

[122] “Vuestmonasterii tandem, captiuitatis suæ tempore, mortuus est:
& in D. Margaritæ sacello sepultus, cum hac inscriptione alabastrica:
Johannes Skeltonus, uates Pierius, hic situs est. Animam egit 21 die
Junii, anno Dn̄i 1529, relictis liberis.” Bale, _Script. Illust. Brit._,
p. 652. ed. 1559. See also Pits (_De Illust. Angl. Script._, p. 703.
ed. 1619) and Fuller (_Worthies, Norfolk_, p. 257. ed. 1662), who give
_Joannes Sceltonus vates Pierius hic situs est_ as the whole of Skelton’s
epitaph. Weever, however (_Fun. Momum._, p. 497. ed. 1631), makes
“_animam egit_, 21 _Junii_ 1529” a portion of it, and in a marginal note
substitutes “ejicit” for “_egit_,” as if _correcting_ the Latinity!! So
too Wood (_Ath. Oxon._ i. 52. ed. Bliss.), who places “ejicit” between
brackets after “_egit_,” and states (what the other writers do not
mention) that the inscription was put on the tomb “soon after” Skelton’s
death.

In the _Church-Wardens Accompts of St. Margaret’s, Westminster_
(Nichols’s _Illust. of Manners and Expences_, &c. 4to. p. 9), we find
this entry;

                                                    _£._ _s._ _d._
    “1529. Item, of Mr. Skelton for viii tapers      0    2    8”

The institution of the person who succeeded Skelton as rector of Diss is
dated 17th July: see first note on the present Memoir.

[123] See note, p. xxxvi.

[124] e. g. the portrait on the title-page of _Dyuers Balettys and
Dyties solacyous_ (evidently from the press of Pynson; see Appendix II.
to this Memoir) is given as a portrait of “Doctor Boorde” in the _Boke
of Knowledge_ (see reprint, sig. I); and (as Mr. F. R. Atkinson of
Manchester obligingly informed me by letter some years ago) the strange
fantastic figure on the reverse of the title-page of Faukes’s ed. of the
_Garlande of Laurell_, 1523 (poorly imitated in _The Brit. Bibliogr._ iv.
389) is a copy of an early French print.

[125] “Warton has undervalued him [Skelton]; which is the more
remarkable, because Warton was a generous as well as a competent critic.
He seems to have been disgusted with buffooneries, which, like those of
Rabelais, were thrown out as a tub for the whale; for unless Skelton had
written thus for the coarsest palates, he could not have poured forth his
bitter and undaunted satire in such perilous times.” Southey,—_Select

been dramatic compositions: see Notes, vol. ii. 330.

[133] A writer, of whose stupendous ignorance a specimen has been already
cited (p. xxx, note 3), informs us that _Magnyfycence_ “is one of the

  _Coventry Mysteries,—MS. Cott. Vesp. D._ viii. fol. 112.

A reprint of Marshe’s ed. of Skelton’s _Workes_ having appeared in
1736, Pope took occasion, during the next year, to mention them in the
following terms,—casting a blight on our poet’s reputation, from which it
has hardly yet recovered;

  “Chaucer’s worst ribaldry is learn’d by rote,
  And _beastly Skelton_ Heads of Houses quote”—

Note—“Skelton, Poet Laureat to Hen. 8. a Volume of whose Verses has been
lately reprinted, consisting almost wholly of Ribaldry, Obscenity, and
Billingsgate Language.” _The First Epistle of the Second Book of Horace
imitated_, 1737. But Pope was unjust to Skelton; for, though expressions
of decided grossness occur in his writings, _they are comparatively few_;
and during his own time, so far were such expressions from being regarded
as offensive to decency, that in all probability his royal pupil would
not have scrupled to employ them in the presence of Anne Bulleyn and her
maids of honour.




Since the Memoir of Skelton was sent to press, Mr. W. H. Black (with his
usual kindness) has pointed out to me the following entry;

    23d Feb. 12 Edw. iv. [1473]. “Tribus _subclericis_, videlicet
    Roberto Lane, Nicholao Neubold, et _Johanni Skelton_, videlicet
    prædicto Roberto l._s._ et prædictis Nicholao et Johanni
    cuilibet eorum xl._s._” (A like payment was made to _John
    Skelton_ on the 9th of Dec. preceding, when he is mentioned
    with others under the general denomination of _clerks_.) _Books
    of the Treasury of the Receipt of the Exchequer_,—_A_ 4. 38.
    fols. 26, 27. (Public Record Office).

There is, Mr. Black thinks, a possibility that Skelton had been employed,
while a youth, as an under-clerk in the Receipt of the Exchequer; and
observes, that it would seem to have been a temporary occupation, as
there is no trace of any person of that name among the admissions to
offices in the Black Book.

Here begynneth certayne merye tales of Skelton, Poet Lauriat.


¶ How Skelten came late home to Oxford from Abington. Tale i.

Skelton was an Englysheman borne as Skogyn was, and hee was educated &
broughte vp in Oxfoorde: and there was he made a poete lauriat. And on a
tyme he had ben at Abbington to make mery, wher that he had eate salte
meates, and hee did com late home to Oxforde, and he did lye in an ine
named yᵉ Tabere whyche is now the Angell, and hee dyd drynke, & went to
bed. About midnight he was so thyrstie or drye that hee was constrained
to call to the tapster for drynke, & the tapster harde him not. Then hee
cryed to hys oste & hys ostes, and to the ostler, for drinke; and no man
wold here hym: alacke, sayd Skelton, I shall peryshe for lacke of drynke!
what reamedye? At the last he dyd crie out and sayd, Fyer, fyer, fyer!
When Skelton hard euery man bustled hymselfe vpward, & some of them were
naked, & some were halfe asleepe and amased, and Skelton dyd crye, Fier,
fier, styll, that euerye man knewe not whether to resorte; Skelton did go
to bed, and the oste and ostis, & the tapster with the ostler, dyd runne
to Skeltons chamber with candles lyghted in theyr handes, saying, Where,
where, where is the fyer? Here, here, here, said Skelton, & poynted hys
fynger to hys moouth, saying, Fetch me some drynke to quenche the fyer
and the heate and the drinesse in my mouthe: & so they dyd. Wherfore it
is good for euerye man to helpe hys owne selfe in tyme of neede wythe
some policie or crafte, so bee it there bee no deceit nor falshed vsed.


¶ How Skelton drest the Kendallman in the sweat time. [Tale ii.]

On a time Skelton rode from Oxforde to London with a Kendalman, and at
Uxbridge they beyted. The Kendallman layd hys cap vpon the borde in the
hall, and he went to serue hys horse. Skelton tooke yᵉ Kendalmans cappe,
and dyd put betwixte the linyng & the vtter syde a dishe of butter: and
when the Kendalman had drest hys horse, hee dyd come in to diner, and dyd
put on hys cappe (that tyme the sweating sycknes was in all Englande);
at the last, when the butter had take heate of the Kendallmans heade, it
dyd begynne to run ouer hys face and aboute hys cheekes. Skelton sayde,
Syr, you sweate soore: beware yᵗ you haue not the sweatynge sycknesse.
The Kendalman sayde, By the mysse, Ise wrang; I bus goe tyll bed. Skelton
sayd, I am skild on phisicke, & specially in the sweatynge sycknesse,
that I wyll warant any man. In gewd faith, saith the Kendallman, do
see, and Ise bay for your skott to London. Then sayde Skelton, Get you
a kerchiefe, and I wyll bryng you abed: the whiche was donne. Skelton
caused the capp to bee sod in hoat lee, & dryed it: in the mornyng
Skelton and the Kendalman dyd ride merely to London.


¶ Howe Skelton tolde the man that Chryst was very busye in the woodes
with them that made fagots. Tale iii.

When Skelton did cum to London, ther were manye men at the table at
diner. Amongest all other there was one sayde to Skelton, Be you of
Oxforde or of Cambridge a scoler? Skelton sayd, I am of Oxford. Syr,
sayde the man, I will put you a question: you do know wel that after
Christ dyd rise from death to life, it was xl. days after ere he dyd
ascend into heauen, and hee was but certaine times wyth hys discyples,
and when that he did appeare to them, hee dyd neuer tary longe amongest
them, but sodainely vanished from them; I wold fayne know (saith the
man to Skelton) where Chryste was all these xl. dayes. Where hee was,
saythe Skelton, God knoweth; he was verye busye in the woods among hys
labourers, that dyd make fagottes to burne heretickes, & such as thou
art the whych doest aske such diffuse questions: but nowe I wyll tell
thee more; when hee was not with hys mother & hys disciples, hee was in
Paradyce, to comforte the holye patriarches and prophets soules, the
which before he had fet out of hell. And at the daye of hys ascencion,
hee tooke them all vp wyth him into heauen.


¶ Howe the Welshman dyd desyre Skelton to ayde hym in hys sute to the
kynge for a patent to sell drynke. The iiii. Tale.

Skelton, when he was in London, went to the kynges courte, where there
did come to hym a Welshman, saying, Syr, it is so, that manye dooth come
vpp of my country to the kyngs court, and some doth get of the kyng by
patent a castell, and some a parke, & some a forest, and some one fee
and some another, and they dooe lyue lyke honest men; and I shoulde lyue
as honestly as the best, if I myght haue a patyne for good dryncke:
wherefore I dooe praye you to write a fewe woords for mee in a lytle
byll to geue the same to the kynges handes, and I wil geue you well for
your laboure. I am contented, sayde Skelton. Syt downe then, sayde the
Welshman, and write. What shall I wryte? sayde Skelton. The Welshman
sayde, Wryte, dryncke. Nowe, sayd the Welshman, wryte, more dryncke. What
now? sayde Skelton. Wryte nowe, a great deale of dryncke. Nowe, sayd the
Welshman, putte to all thys dryncke a littell crome of breade, and a
great deale of drynke to it, and reade once agayne. Skelton dyd reade,
Dryncke, more dryncke, & a great deale of dryncke, and a lytle crome of
breade, and a great deale of dryncke to it. Then the Welsheman sayde, Put
out the litle crome of breade, and sett in, all dryncke, and no breade:
and if I myght haue thys sygned of the kynge, sayde the Welsheman, I care
for no more as longe as I dooe lyue. Well then, sayde Skelton, when you
haue thys signed of the kyng, then wyll I labour for a patent to haue
bread, that you wyth your drynke, and I with the bread, may fare well,
and seeke our liuinge with bagge and staffe.


¶ Of Swanborne the knaue, that was buried vnder Saint Peters wall in
Oxford. [Tale v.]

There was dwelling in Oxford a stark knaue, whose name was Swanborn; and
he was such a notable knaue that, if any scoler had fallen out thone
wyth thother, the one woulde call thother Swanborn, the whyche they dyd
take for a worser woorde then knaue. Hys wife woulde diuers tymes in the
weeke kimbe his head with a iii. footed stoole: then hee woulde runne
out of the doores wepinge, and if anye man had asked hym what he dyd
aile, other whyle he woulde saye hee had the megrym in hys head, or ells,
there was a great smoke wythin the house: & if the doores were shut, hys
wyfe woulde beate him vnder the bed, or into the bench hole, and then he
woulde looke out at the cat hole; then woulde his wife saye, Lookest thou
out, whoreson? Yea, woulde he saye, thou shalt neuer let me of my manly
lookes. Then with her distaff she would poore in at hym. I knewe him
when that he was a boye in Oxforde; hee was a littell olde fellowe, and
woulde lye as fast as a horse woulde trotte. At last hee dyed, and was
buried vnder the wall of S. Peters church. Then Skelton was desyred to
make an epitaphe vppon the churche wall, & dyd wryte wyth a role, saying,
Belsabub his soule saue, _Qui iacet hic hec_ a knaue: _Jam scio[138]
mortuus est, Et iacet hic hec_ a beast: _Sepultus[139] est_ amonge the
weedes: God forgiue him his misdeedes!


¶ Howe Skelton was complayned on to the bishop of Norwich. Tale vi.

Skelton dyd keepe a musket at Dys, vpon the which he was complayned on to
the bishop of Norwych. The byshoppe sent for Skelton. Skelton dyd take
two capons, to geue theym for a presente to the byshop. And as soone as
hee had saluted the byshopp, hee sayde, My lorde, here I haue brought
you a couple of capons. The byshop was blynde, and sayde, Who bee you?
I am Skelton, sayd Skelton. The byshop sayd, A hoare head! I will none
of thy capons: thou keepest vnhappye rule in thy house, for the whyche
thou shalt be punished. What, sayde Skelton, is the winde at that doore?
and sayd, God be with you, my lorde! and Skelton with his capons went
hys way. The byshop sent after Skelton to come agayne. Skelton sayde,
What, shal I come[140] agayne to speake wythe a madde man? At last hee
retourned to the byshop, whyche sayde to hym, I would, sayd the byshop,
that you shoulde not lyue suche a sclaunderouse lyfe, that all your
parisshe shoulde not wonder & complaine on you as they dooe; I pray you
amende, and hereafter lyue honestlye, that I heare no more suche woordes
of you; and if you wyll tarye dynner, you shall be welcome; and I thanke
you, sayde the byshoppe, for your capons. Skelton sayde, My lord, my
capons haue proper names; the one is named Alpha, the other is named
Omega: my lorde, sayd Skelton, this capon is named Alpha, thys is the
fyrst capon that I dyd euer geue to you; and this capon is named Omega,
and this is the last capon that euer I wil giue you: & so fare you well,
sayd Skelton.


¶ Howe Skelton, when hee came from the bishop, made a sermon. Tale vii.

Skelton the nexte Sondaye after wente into the pulpet to prech, and
sayde, _Vos estis, vos estis_, that is to saye, You be, you be. And what
be you? sayd Skelton: I saye, that you bee a sorte of knaues, yea, and
a man might saye worse then knaues; and why, I shall shew you. You haue
complayned of mee to the bysop that I doo keepe a fayre wench in my
house: I dooe tell you, if you had any fayre wiues, it were some what
to helpe me at neede; I am a man as you be: you haue foule wyues, and I
haue a faire wenche, of the whyche I haue begotten a fayre boye, as I doe
thinke, and as you all shall see. Thou wyfe, sayde Skelton, that hast my
childe, be not afraid; bring me hither my childe to me: the whyche was
doone. And he, shewynge his childe naked to all the parishe, sayde, How
saye you, neibours all? is not this child as fayre as is the beste of all
yours? It hathe nose, eyes, handes, and feete, as well as any of your:
it is not lyke a pygge, nor a calfe, nor like no foule nor no monstruous
beast. If I had, sayde Skelton, broughte forthe thys chylde without armes
or legges, or that it wer deformed, being a monstruous thyng, I woulde
neuer haue blamed you to haue complayned to the bishop of me; but to
complain without a cause, I say, as I said before in my antethem, _vos
estis_, you be, and haue be, & wyll and shall be knaues, to complayne
of me wythout a cause resonable. For you be presumptuous, & dooe exalte
yourselues, and therefore you shall be made low: as I shall shewe you
a famyller example of a parish priest, the whiche dyd make a sermon in
Rome. And he dyd take that for hys antethem, the which of late dayes is
named a theme, and sayde, _Qui se exaltat humiliabitur, et qui se[141]
humiliat exaltabitur_, that is to say, he that doth exalte himselfe or
dothe extoll hymselfe shalbe made meke, & he that doth humble hymselfe or
is meke, shalbe exalted, extoulled, or eleuated, or sublimated, or such
lyke: and that I will shewe you by this my cap. This cappe was fyrste
my hoode, when that I was studente in Jucalico, & then it was so proude
that it woulde not bee contented, but it woulde slippe and fall from
my shoulders. I perceyuynge thys that he was proude, what then dyd I?
shortly to conclude, I dyd make of hym a payre of breches to my hose, to
brynge hym lowe. And when that I dyd see, knowe, or perceyue that he was
in that case, and allmoste worne cleane oute, what dyd I then to extoll
hym vppe agayne? you all may see that this my cap was made of it that was
my breches. Therefore, sayde Skelton, _vos estis_, therfore you bee, as
I dyd saye before: if that you exalte yourselfe, and cannot be contented
that I haue my wenche still, some of you shall weare hornes; and therfore
_vos estis_: and so farewell. It is merye in the hall, when beardes wagge
all.


¶ How the fryer asked leaue of Skelton to preach at Dys, which Skelton
wold not grant. Tale viii.

There was a fryer yᵉ whych dydde come to Skelton to haue licence to
preach at Dys. What woulde you preache there? sayde Skelton: dooe not
you thynke that I am sufficiente to preache there in myne owne cure?
Syr, sayde the freere, I am the limyter of Norwych, and once a yeare one
of our place dothe vse to preache wyth you, to take the deuocion of the
people; and if I may haue your good wil, so bee it, or els I will come
and preach against your will, by the authoritie of the byshope of Rome,
for I haue hys bulles to preache in euerye place, and therfore I wyll be
there on Sondaye nexte cummyng. Come not there, freere, I dooe counsell
thee, sayd Skelton. The Sundaye nexte followynge Skelton layde watch for
the comynge of the frere: and as sone as Skelton had knowledge of the
freere, he went into the pulpet to preache. At last the freere dyd come
into the churche with the bishoppe of Romes bulles in hys hande. Skelton
then sayd to all hys parishe, See, see, see, and poynted to thee fryere.
All the parish gased on the frere. Then sayde Skelton, Maisters, here is
as wonderfull a thynge as euer was seene: you all dooe knowe that it is a
thynge daylye seene, a bulle dothe begette a calfe; but here, contrarye
to all nature, a calfe hathe gotten a bulle; for thys fryere, beeynge a
calfe, hath gotten a bulle of the byshoppe of Rome. The fryere, beynge
ashamed, woulde neuer after that time presume to preach at Dys.


¶ How Skelton handled the fryer that woulde needes lye with him in his
inne. Tale ix.

As Skelton ryd into yᵉ countre, there was a frere that hapened in at an
alehouse wheras Skelton was lodged, and there the frere dyd desire to
haue lodgyng. The alewife sayd, Syr, I haue but one bed whereas master
Skelton doth lye. Syr, sayd the frere, I pray you that I maye lye with
you. Skelton said, Master freere, I doo vse to haue no man to lye with
me. Sir, sayd the frere, I haue lyne with as good men as you, and for my
money I doo looke to haue lodgynge as well as you. Well, sayde Skelton,
I dooe see than that you wyll lye with me. Yea, syr, sayd the frere.
Skelton did fill all the cuppes in the house, and whitled the frere, that
at the last, the frere was in myne eames peason. Then sayde Skelton,
Mayster freere, get you to bed, and I wyll come to bed within a while.
The frere went, and dyd lye vpright, and snorted lyke a sowe. Skelton
wente to the chaumber, and dyd see that the freere dyd lye soe; sayd to
the wyfe, Geue me a washyng betle. Skelton then caste downe the clothes,
and the freere dyd lye starke naked: then Skelton dyd shite vpon the
freeres nauil and bellye; and then he did take the washyng betle, and
dyd strike an harde stroke vppon the nauill & bellye of the freere, and
dyd put out the candell, and went out of the chaumber. The freere felt
hys bellye, & smelt a foule sauour, had thought hee had ben gored, and
cried out and sayde, Helpe, helpe, helpe, I am kylled! They of the house
with Skelton wente into the chaumber, and asked what the freere dyd ayle.
The freere sayde, I am kylled, one hathe thrust me in the bellye. Fo,
sayde Skelton, thou dronken soule, thou doost lye; thou haste beshytten
thyselfe. Fo, sayde Skelton, let vs goe oute of the chaumber, for the
knaue doothe stynke. The freere was ashamed, and cryed for water. Out
with the whoreson, sayd Skelton, and wrap the sheetes togyther, and putte
the freere in the hogge stye, or in the barne. The freere said, geue me
some water into the barne: and there the freere dyd wasshe himselfe,
and dydde lye there all the nyght longe. The chaumber and the bedde was
dressed, and the sheetes shyfted; and then Skelton went to bed.


¶ Howe the cardynall desyred Skelton to make an epitaphe vpon his graue.
Tale x.

Thomas Wolsey, cardynall and archbyshop of Yorke, had made a regall
tombe to lye in after hee was deade: and he desyred Master Skelton to
make for his tombe an epytaphe, whyche is a memoriall to shewe the lyfe
with the actes of a noble man. Skelton sayde, If it dooe lyke your
grace, I canne not make an epytaphe vnlesse that I do se your tombe. The
cardynall sayde, I dooe praye you to meete wyth mee to morowe at the West
Monesterye, and there shall you se my tombe a makynge. The pointment
kept, and Skelton, seyng the sumptuous coste, more pertaynyng for an
emperoure or a maxymyous kynge, then for suche a man as he was (although
cardynals wyll compare wyth kyngs), Well, sayd Skelton, if it shall like
your grace to creepe into thys tombe whiles you be alyue, I can make an
epitaphe; for I am sure that when that you be dead you shall neuer haue
it. The whyche was verifyed of truthe.


¶ Howe the hostler dyd byte Skeltons mare vnder the tale, for biting him
by the arme. Tale xi.

Skelton vsed muche to ryde on a mare; and on a tyme hee happened into an
inne, wher there was a folish ostler. Skelton said, Ostler, hast thou any
mares bread? No, syr, sayd the ostler: I haue good horse bread, but I
haue no mares bread. Skelton saide, I must haue mares bread. Syr, sayde
the ostler, there is no mares bred to get in all the towne. Well, sayd
Skelton, for this once, serue my mare wyth horse bread. In the meane time
Skelton commaunded the ostler to sadle his mare; & the hosteler dyd
gyrde the mare hard, and the hostler was in hys ierkyn, and hys shirte
sleues wer aboue his elbowes, and in the girding of the mare hard the
mare bitte the hostler by the arme, and bitte him sore. The hostler was
angry, and dyd bite the mare vnder the tayle, saying, A whore, is it good
byting by the bare arme? Skelton sayde then, Why, fellowe, haste thou
hurt my mare? Yea, sayde the hostler, ka me, ka thee: yf she dooe hurte
me, I wyll displease her.


¶ Howe the cobler tolde maister Skelton, it is good sleeping in a whole
skinne. Tale xii.

In the parysshe of Dys, whereas Skelton was person, there dwelled a
cobler, beyng halfe a souter, which was a tall man and a greate slouen,
otherwyse named a slouche. The kynges maiestye hauynge warres byyonde
the sea, Skelton sayd to thys aforsayd doughtie man, Neybour, you be a
tall man, and in the kynges warres you must bere a standard. A standerd!
said the cobler, what a thing is that? Skelton saide, It is a great
banner, such a one as thou dooest vse to beare in Rogacyon weeke; and a
lordes, or a knyghtes, or a gentlemannes armes shall bee vpon it; and
the souldiers that be vnder the aforesayde persons fayghtynge vnder thy
banner. Fayghtynge! sayde the cobbeler; I can no skil in faighting. No,
said Skelton, thou shalte not fayght, but holde vp, and aduaunce the
banner. By my fay, sayd the cobler, I can no skill in the matter. Well,
sayd Skelton, there is no reamedie but thou shalte forthe to dooe the
kynges seruice in hys warres, for in all this countrey theare is not a
more likelier manne to dooe suche a[142] feate as thou arte. Syr, sayde
the cobbeler, I wyll geue you a fatte capon, that I maye bee at home.
No, sayde Skelton, I wyll not haue none of thy capons; for thou shalte
doe the kyng seruice in his wars. Why, sayd the cobler, what shuld I
doo? wyll you haue me to goe in the kynges warres, and to bee killed for
my labour? then I shall be well at ease, for I shall haue my mendes in
my nown handes. What, knaue, sayd Skelton, art thou a cowarde, hauyng
so great bones? No, sayde the cobler, I am not afearde: it is good to
slepe in a whole skinne. Why, said Skelton, thou shalte bee harnessed to
keepe away the strokes from thy skynne. By my fay, sayde the cobler, if
I must needes forthe, I will see howe yehe shall bee ordered. Skelton
dyd harnesse the doughtye squirell, and dyd put an helmet on his head;
and when the helmet was on the coblers heade, the cobler sayde, What
shall those hoales serue for? Skelton sayd, Holes to looke out to see
thy enemyes. Yea, sayde the cobler, then am I in worser case then euer
I was; for then one may come and thrust a nayle into one of the holes,
and prycke out myne eye. Therfore, said the cobler to Master Skelton, I
wyll not goe to warre: my wyfe shall goe in my steade, for she can fyghte
and playe the deuell wyth her distaffe, and with stole, staffe, cuppe,
or candlesticke; for, by my fay, I cham sicke; I chill go home to bed; I
thinke I shall dye.


¶ How Master Skeltons miller deceyued hym manye times by playinge the
theefe, and howe he was pardoned by Master Skelton, after the stealinge
awaye of a preest oute of his bed at midnight. Tale xiii.

When Maister Skelton dyd dwell in the countrey, hee was agreede with a
miller to haue hys corne grounde tolle free; and manye tymes when hys
mayden[s] shoulde bake, they wanted of their mele, and complained to
their mystres that they could not make their stint of breade. Mystres
Skelton, beeynge verye angrye, tolde her husbande of it. Then Master
Skelton sent for his miller, and asked hym howe it chansed that hee
deceyued hym of his corne. I! saide John miller; nay, surely I neuer
deceyued you; if that you can proue that by mee, do with mee as you
lyste. Surely, sayd Skelton, if I doe fynde thee false anye more,
thou shalt be hanged up by the necke. So Skelton apoynted one of hys
seruauntes to stand at the mill whyle the corne was a grindyng. John
myller, beyng a notable theefe, would feyn haue deceued him as he had
don before, but beyng afrayd of Skeltons seruaunte, caused his wyfe to
put one of her chyldren into yᵉ myll dam, and to crye, Help, help, my
childe is drowned! With that, John myller and all went out of the myll;
& Skeltons seruaunte, being dilygent to helpe the chylde, thought not
of the meale, and the while the myllers boye was redy wyth a sacke, and
stole awaye the corne; so, when they had taken vp the childe, and all
was safe, they came in agayne; & so the seruaunt, hauynge hys gryste,
went home mistrustyng nothynge; and when the maydes came to bake againe,
as they dyd before, so they lacked of theyr meale agayne. Master Skelton
calde for hys man, and asked him howe it chaunced that he was deceaued;
& hee sayd that hee coulde not tell, For I dyd your commaundement. And
then Master Skelton sent for the myller, and sayde, Thou hast not vsed
mee well, for I want of my mele. Why, what wold you haue me do? sayde
the miller; you haue set your own man to watche mee. Well, then, sayd
Skelton, if thou doest not tell me whych waye thou hast played the theefe
wyth mee, thou shalt be hanged. I praye you be good master vnto me, & I
wyll tell you the trutthe: your seruaunt wold not from my myll, & when I
sawe none other remedye, I caused my wyfe to put one of my chyldren into
the water, & to crie that it was drowned; and whiles wee were helpyng
of the chylde out, one of my boyes dyd steale your corne. Yea, sayde
Skelton, if thou haue suche pretie fetchis, you can dooe more then thys;
and therfore, if thou dooeste not one thynge that I shall tell thee, I
wyll folow the lawe on thee. What is that? sayd the myller. If that thou
dooest not steale my cuppe of the table, when I am sette at meate, thou
shalt not eskape my handes. O good master, sayd John miller, I pray you
forgeue me, and let me not dooe thys; I am not able to dooe it. Thou
shalt neuer be forgeuen, sayde Skelton, withoute thou dooest it. When
the miller saw no remedye, he went & charged one of hys boyes, in an
euenyng (when that Skelton was at supper) to sette fyre in one of hys
hogges sties, farre from any house, for doyng any harme. And it chaunced,
that one of Skeltons seruauntes came oute, and spied the fire, and hee
cryede, Helpe, helpe! for all that my master hath is lyke to be burnt.
Hys master, hearing this, rose from hys supper with all the companie, and
went to quenche the fyre; and the while John miller came in, and stole
away hys cuppe, & went hys way. The fire being quickly slaked, Skelton
cam in with his frendes, and reasoned wyth hys frendes which way they
thought the fyre shoulde come; and euerye man made answer as thei thought
good. And as they wer resonyng, Skelton called for a cup of beare; and
in no wise his cuppe whyche hee vsed to drynke in woulde not be founde.
Skelton was verye angrie that his cup was mysynge, and asked whiche
waye it shoulde bee gone; and no manne coulde tell hym of it. At last he
bethought him of the miller, & sayd, Surely, he, that theefe, hath done
this deede, and he is worthye to be hanged. And hee sent for the miller:
so the miller tolde hym all howe hee had done. Truely, sayd Skelton, thou
art a notable knaue; and withoute thou canste do me one other feate, thou
shalte dye. O good master, sayde the miller, you promised to pardon me,
and wil you now breake your promise? I, sayd Skelton; wythout thou canste
steale the sheetes of my bed, when my wyfe and I am aslepe, thou shalte
be hanged, that all suche knaues shall take ensample by thee. Alas, sayd
the miller, whych waye shall I dooe this thinge? it is vnpossible for me
to get theym while you bee there. Well, sayde Skelton, withoute thou dooe
it, thou knowest the daunger. The myller went hys way, beyng very heauy,
& studyed whiche waye he myght doo thys deede. He hauynge a little boy,
whyche knewe all the corners of Skeltons house & where hee lay, vpon a
night when they were all busie, the boie crepte in vnder his bed, wyth a
potte of yeste; and when Skelton & hys wyfe were fast aslepe, hee all to
noynted the sheetes with yeste, as farre as hee coulde reache. At last
Skelton awaked, & felt the sheetes all wete; waked his wife, and sayd,
What, hast thou beshitten the bed? and she sayd, Naye, it is you that
haue doone it, I thynke, for I am sure it is not I. And so theare fel a
great strife betweene Skelton and his wyfe, thinkyng that the bedd had
ben beshitten; and called for the mayde to geue them a cleane payre of
shetes. And so they arose, & the mayde tooke the foule sheetes and threw
them vnderneath the bed, thinkynge the nexte morning to haue fetched
them away. The next time the maydes shuld goe to washynge, they looked
all about, and coulde not fynde the sheetes; for Jacke the myllers boy
had stollen them awaye. Then the myller was sent for agayne, to knowe
where the sheetes were become: & the myller tolde Mayster Skelton all
how he deuised to steale the sheetes. Howe say ye? sayde Skelton to hys
frendes; is not this a notable theef? is he not worthy to be hanged that
canne dooe these deedes? O good maister, quoth the miller, nowe forgeue
mee accordynge to youre promyse; for I haue done all that you haue
commaunded mee, and I trust now you wyll pardon me. Naye, quoth Skelton,
thou shalt doo yet one other feate, and that shall bee thys; thou shalte
steale maister person out of hys bed at midnight, that he shall not know
where he is become. The miller made great mone and lamented, saying,
I can not tel in the world howe I shall dooe, for I am neuer able to
dooe this feate. Well, sayde Skelton, thou shalt dooe it, or els thou
shalt fynde no fauour at my hands; and therfore go thy way. The miller,
beynge sorye, deuysed with himselfe which way he might bryng this thing
to passe. And ii. or iii. nyghtes after, gathered a number of snailes,
& greed with the sexten of the churche to haue the key of the churche
dore, and went into the churche betwene the houres of a xi. and xii.
in the night, & tooke the snayles, and lyghted a sorte of little waxe
candles, & set vppon euerie snayle one, & the snayles crepte about the
churche wyth the same candels vpon their backes; and then he went into
the vestrey, and put a cope vppon hys backe, & stoode very solemnely at
the hye alter with a booke in hys hand; and afterwarde tolled the bell,
that the preest lyinge in the churche yard might heare hym. The preest,
hearyng the bell tolle, starte oute of his slepe, and looked out of hys
windowe, and sawe suche a lyght in the church, was very muche amased, and
thought surely that the churche had ben on fire, and wente for to see
what wonder it shoulde be. And when he came there, he founde the church
dore open, and went vp into the quier; and see the miller standyng in hys
vestementes, and a booke in hys hand, praying deuoutly, & all the lyghtes
in the church, thought surely with hymselfe it was some angeil come downe
from heauen, or some other great miracle, blessed hymselfe and sayde, In
the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoste, what arte thou
that standest here in thys hollye place? O, sayde the myller, I am saynt
Peter, whych kepe[143] the keyes of heauen gate, and thou knowest that
none can enter into heauen excepte I let hym in; and I am sent oute from
heauen for thee. For mee! quoth the preest: good saynt Peter, worship
maye thou be! I am glad to heare that newes. Because thou hast done good
deedes, sayd the myller, and serued God, hee hath sent for thee afore
domes day come, that thou shalt not knowe the troubles of yᵉ worlde. O,
blessed be God! sayde the preest; I am very well contented for to goe:
yet if it woulde please God to let me go home and distrybute such things
as I haue to the poore, I woulde bee verye glad. No, sayde the miller;
if thou dooest delite more in thy goodes then in the joyes of heauen,
thou art not for God; therefore prepare thyselfe, and goe into this bagge
which I have brought for thee. The miller hauyng a great quarter sacke,
the poore priest wente into it, thynkyng verylye hee had gon to heauen,
yet was very sory to parte from hys goodes; asked saynt Peter how long it
wold be ere he came there. The miller sayd he should be there quickly;
and in he got the priest, and tied vp the sacke, and put out the lightes,
& layed euery thynge in their place, and tooke the preest on his backe, &
locked the church dores, & to go: and when he came to go ouer the church
stile, the preest was verye heauye, and the miller caste hym ouer the
stile that the priest cryed oh. O good seint Peter, sayde the preeste,
whyther goe I nowe? O, sayde the myller, these bee the panges that ye
must abyde before you come to heauen. O, quoth the preest, I would I were
there once! Vp he got the priest agayn, & caried hym tyll hee came to the
toppe of an hye hyll, a litle from hys house, and caste hym downe the
hyll, that hys head had many shrewde rappes, that hys necke was almost
burst. O good saynt Peter, said the priest, where am I nowe? You are
almost nowe at heauen; & caried hym with much a doo, tyll hee came to hys
owne house, and then the miller threwe him ouer the thresholde. O good
saynte Peter, sayde the preeste, where am I nowe? thys is the soreste
pange that euer I bydde. O, sayd the[144] myller, geue God thankes that
thou haste had pacience to abide all thys payne, for nowe thou arte goyng
vppe into heauen; and tyed a rope aboute the sacke, and drewe hym vppe
to the toppe of the chymnye, and there let him hange. O good S. Peter,
tell me nowe where I am, sayde the preest. Marye, sayd he, thou art now
in the tope of John millers chimney. A vengeaunce on thee, knaue! sayde
the preeste: hast thou made me beleue al this while that I was goyng vp
into heauen? well, nowe I am here, & ever I come downe again, I wil make
thee to repent it. But John myller was gladd that he had brought hym
there. And in the mornyng the sexten rang all in to seruise; & when the
people were come to churche, the preest was lackynge. The parish asked
the sexten wher the preest was; and the sexten sayd, I can not tell:
then the parrishe sent to master Skelton, and tolde howe their prieste
was lacking to saye them seruice. Mayster Skelton meruayled at that, and
bethought hym of the crafty dooyng of the miller, sent for John myller;
and when the miller was come, Skelton sayd to the miller, Canst thou
tell wher the parish preest is? The myller vp and told him all togither
how he had doone. Maister Skelton, considering the matter, sayde to the
miller, Why, thou vnreuerent knaue, hast thou hanled the poore preest
on this fashion, and putte on the holy ornaments vpon a knaues backe?
thou shalte be hanged, & it coste me all the good I haue. John miller
fell vppon his knees, and desyred maister Skelton to pardon hym; For I
dyd nothynge, sayd the miller, but that you sayd you woulde forgeue me.
Nay, not so, sayd Skelton; but if thou canst steale my gelding out of my
stable, my two men watching him, I will pardon thee; and if they take
thee, they shall strike of thy heade; for Skelton thoughte it better that
such a false knaue shoulde lose hys head then to liue. Then John miller
was very sad, & bethought him how to bring it to passe. Then he remembred
that ther was a man left hangyng vppon the galowes the day before, went
preuely in the nyght and tooke him downe, and cut of his head, and put it
vpon a pole, & brake a hole into the stable, and put in a candle lighted,
thrustyng in the head a lytle & a lytle. The men watching the stable,
seynge that, got them selues neare to the hole (thinkinge that it was his
head), & one of them wyth hys sworde cutte it of. Then they for gladnesse
presented it vnto theyr master, leauynge the stable doore open: then
John miller went in, and stole away the gelding. Master Skelton, lookyng
vppon the head, sawe it was the theues head that was left hangyng vpon
the galowes, sayd, Alas, how ofte hath this false knaue deceiued vs! Go
quickly to the stable agayne, for I thinke my geldyng is gone. Hys men,
goyng backe agayn, found it euen so. Then they came agayn, and told their
maister hys horse was gone. Ah, I thought so, you doltish knaues! said
Skelton; but if I had sent wise men about it, it had not ben so. Then
Skelton sent for the miller, and asked hym if hee coulde tell where hys
horse was. Safe ynough, maister, sayde the miller: for hee tolde Skelton
all the matter how hee had done. Well, sayd Skelton, consyderyng hys
tale, sayd, that he was worthie to bee hanged, For thou doost excell
all the theeues that euer I knew or heard of; but for my promise sake I
forgeue thee, vpon condition thou wilte become an honest man, & leaue all
thy crafte & false dealyng. And thus John miller skaped vnpunished.


¶ How Skelton was in prison at the commaundement of the cardinall. [Tale
xiv.]

On a tyme Skelton did meete with certain frendes of hys at Charyng
crosse, after that hee was in prison at my lord cardynals commaundement:
& his frende sayd, I am glad you bee abrode amonge your frendes, for you
haue ben long pent in. Skelton sayd, By the masse, I am glad I am out
indeede, for I haue ben pent in, like a roche or fissh, at Westminster
in prison. The cardinal, hearing of those words, sent for him agayne.
Skelton kneling of hys knees before hym, after long communication to
Skelton had, Skelton desyred the cardinall to graunte hym[145] a boun.
Thou shalt haue none, sayd the cardynall. Thassistence desirid that he
might haue it graunted, for they thought it should be some merye pastime
that he wyll shewe your grace. Say on, thou hore head, sayd the cardynall
to Skelton. I pray your grace to let me lye doune and wallow, for I can
kneele no longer.


¶ Howe the vinteners wife put water into Skeltons wine. Tale xv.

Skelton did loue wel a cup of good wyne. And on a daye he dyd make merye
in a tauerne in London: and the morow after hee sent to the same place
againe for a quart of yᵉ same wine he drunke of before; the whiche was
clene chaunged & brued again. Skelton perceiuing this, he went to the
tauerne, & dyd sytte down in a chaire, & dyd sygh very sore, and made
great lamentacion. The wife of the house, perceiuinge this, said to
master Skelton, Howe is it with you, master Skelton? He answered and
said, I dyd neuer so euill; and then he dyd reache another greate syghe,
sayinge, I am afraide that I shal neuer be saued, nor cum to heauen. Why,
said the wife, shuld you dispaire so much in Goddes mercy? Nay, said he,
it is past all remedye. Then said the wife, I dooe praye you breake your
mind vnto mee. O, sayd Skelton, I would gladlye shewe you the cause of my
dolour, if that I wist that you would keepe my counsell. Sir, said shee,
I haue ben made of councel of greater matters then you can shew me. Naye,
nay, said Skelton, my matter passeth all other matters, for I think I
shal sinke to hell for my great offences; for I sent thys daye to you for
wyne to saye masse withall; and wee haue a stronge lawe that euery priest
is bounde to put into hys chalice, when hee doth singe or saye masse,
some wyne and water; the which dothe signifye the water & bloude that dyd
runne oute of Chrystes syde, when Longeous the blynde knyght dyd thrust
a speare to Christes harte; & thys daye I dyd put no water into my wyne,
when that I did put wine into my chalys. Then sayd the vintiners wife, Be
mery, maister Skelton, and keepe my counsell, for, by my faythe, I dyd
put into the vessell of wyne that I did send you of to day x. gallandes
of water; and therfore take no thought, master Skelton, for I warraunt
you. Then said Skelton, Dame, I dooe beshrewe thee for thy laboure, for
I thought so muche before; for throughe such vses & brewyng of wyne maye
men be deceyued, and be hurte by drynkinge of suche euell wyne; for
all wines must be strong, and fayre, and well coloured; it must haue a
redolent sauoure; it must be colde, and sprinkclynge in the peece or in
the glasse.

NOTICES OF SKELTON FROM VARIOUS SOURCES.


From the imperfect copy of _A C. Mery Talys_, small fol., printed by John
Rastell. (See Singer’s reprint, p. 55.)

    “Of mayster Skelton that broughte the bysshop of Norwiche ii
    fesauntys. xl.

It fortuned ther was a great varyance bitwen the bysshop of Norwych
and one mayster Skelton a poyet lauryat; in so much that the bysshop
commaundyd hym that he shuld not come in his gatys. Thys mayster Skelton
dyd absent hymselfe for a long seson. But at the laste he thought to do
hys dewty to hym, and studyed weys how he myght obtayne the bysshopys
fauour, and determynyd hemself that he wold come to hym wyth some
present, and humble hymself to the byshop; and gat a cople of fesantes,
and cam to the bysshuppys place, and requyryd the porter he myghte come
in to speke wyth my lord. This porter, knowyng his lordys pleasure, wold
not suffer him to come in at the gatys; wherfor thys mayster Skelton
went on the baksyde to seke some other way to come in to the place. But
the place was motyd that he cowlde se no way to come ouer, except in one
place where there lay a long tree ouer the motte in maner of a brydge,
that was fallyn down wyth wynd; wherfore thys mayster Skelton went along
vpon the tree to come ouer, and whan he was almost ouer, hys fote slyppyd
for lak of sure fotyng, and fel into the mote vp to myddyll; but at the
last he recoueryd hymself, and, as well as he coud, dryed hymself ageyne,
and sodenly cam to the byshop, beyng in hys hall, than lately rysen
from dyner: whyche, whan he saw Skelton commyng sodenly, sayd to hym,
Why, thow caytyfe, I warnyd the thow shuldys neuer come in at my gatys,
and chargyd my porter to kepe the out. Forsoth, my lorde, quod Skelton,
though ye gaue suche charge, and though your gatys by neuer so suerly
kept, yet yt ys no more possible to kepe me out of your dorys than to
kepe out crowes or pyes; for I cam not in at your gatys, but I cam ouer
the mote, that I haue ben almost drownyd for my labour. And shewyd hys
clothys how euyll he was arayed, whych causyd many that stode therby
to laughe apace. Than quod Skelton, Yf it lyke your lordeshyp, I haue
brought you a dyshe to your super, a cople of fesantes. Nay, quod the
byshop, I defy the and thy fesauntys also, and, wrech as thou art, pyke
the out of my howse, for I wyll none of thy gyft how [_something lost
here_] Skelton than, consyderynge that the bysshoppe called hym fole so
ofte, sayd to one of hys famylyers thereby, that thoughe it were euyll
to be christened a fole, yet it was moche worse to be confyrmyd a fole
of suche a bysshoppe, for the name of confyrmacyon muste nedes abyde.
Therfore he ymagened howe he myghte auoyde that confyrmacyon, and mused
a whyle, and at the laste sayde to the bysshope thus, If your lordeshype
knewe the names of these fesantes, ye wold [be] contente to take them.
Why, caytefe, quod the bisshoppe hastly and angrey, [what] be theyr
names? Ywys, my lorde, quod Skelton, this fesante is called Alpha, which
is, in primys the fyrst, and this is called O, that is, novissimus the
last; and for the more playne vnderstandynge of my mynde, if it plese
your lordeshype to take them, I promyse you, this Alpha is the fyrste
that euer I gaue you, and this O is the laste that euer I wyll gyue you
whyle I lyue. At which answere all that were by made great laughter, and
they all de[sired the bishoppe] to be good lorde vnto him for his merye
conceytes: at which [earnest entrety, as it] wente, the bysshope was
contente to take hym vnto his fauer agayne.

By thys tale ye may se that mery conceytes dothe [a man more] good than
to frete hymselfe with a[nger] and melancholy.”

  “If slouth and tract of time
    (That wears eche thing away)
  Should rust and canker worthy artes,
    Good works would soen decay.
  If suche as present are
    Forgoeth the people past,
  Our selu[e]s should soen in silence slepe,
    And loes renom at last.
  No soyll nor land so rude
    But som odd men can shoe:
  Than should the learned pas unknowne,
    Whoes pen & skill did floe?
  God sheeld our slouth[146] wear sutch,
    Or world so simple nowe,
  That knowledge scaept without reward,
    Who sercheth vertue throwe,
  And paints forth vyce aright,
    And blames abues of men,
  And shoes what lief desarues rebuke,
    And who the prayes of pen.
  You see howe forrayn realms
    Aduance their poets all;
  And ours are drowned in the dust,
    Or flong against the wall.
  In Fraunce did Marrot raigne;
    And neighbour thear vnto
  Was Petrark, marching full with Dantte,
    Who erst did wonders do;
  Among the noble Grekes
    Was Homere full of skill;
  And where that Ouid norisht was
    The soyll did florish still
  With letters hie of style;
    But Virgill wan the fraes,[147]
  And past them all for deep engyen,
    And made them all to gaes
  Upon the bookes he made:
    Thus eche of them, you see,
  Wan prayse and fame, and honor had,
    Eche one in their degree.
  I pray you, then, my friendes,
    Disdaine not for to vewe
  The workes and sugred verses fine
    Of our raer poetes newe;
  Whoes barborus language rued
    Perhaps ye may mislike;
  But blame them not that ruedly playes
    If they the ball do strike,
  Nor skorne not mother tunge,
    O babes of Englishe breed!
  I haue of other language seen,
    And you at full may reed
  Fine verses trimly wrought,
    And coutcht in comly sort;
  But neuer I nor you, I troe,
    In sentence plaine and short
  Did yet beholde with eye,
    In any forraine tonge,
  A higher verse, a staetly[er] style,
    That may be read or song,
  Than is this daye indeede

  The grace wherof doth touch yᵉ gods,
    And reatch the cloudes somtime.
  Thorow earth and waters deepe
    The pen by skill doth passe,
  And featly nyps the worldes abuse,
    And shoes vs in a glasse
  The vertu and the vice
    Of eury wyght alyue:
  The hony combe that bee doth make
    Is not so sweete in hyue
  As are the golden leues
    That drops from poets head,
  Which doth surmount our common talke
    As farre as dros doth lead:
  The flowre is sifted cleane,
    The bran is cast aside,
  And so good corne is knowen from chaffe,
    And each fine graine is spide.
  Peers Plowman was full plaine,
    And Chausers spreet was great;
  Earle Surry had a goodly vayne;
    Lord Vaus the marke did beat,
  And Phaer did hit the pricke
    In thinges he did translate,
  And Edwards had a special gift;
    And diuers men of late

    That first was baes and brute:—
  Ohe, shall I leaue out Skeltons name,
    The blossome of my frute,
  The tree wheron indeed
    My branchis all might groe?
  Nay, Skelton wore the lawrell wreath,
    And past in schoels, ye knoe;
  A poet for his arte,
    Whoes iudgment suer was hie,
  And had great practies of the pen,
    His works they will not lie;
  His terms to taunts did lean,
    His talke was as he wraet,
  Full quick of witte, right sharp of words,
    And skilfull of the staet;
  Of reason riep and good,
    And to the haetfull mynd,
  That did disdain his doings still,
    A skornar of his kynd;
  Most pleasant euery way,
    As poets ought to be,
  And seldom out of princis grace,
    And great with eche degre.
  Thus haue you heard at full
    What Skelton was indeed;
  A further knowledge shall you haue,
    If you his bookes do reed.
  I haue of meer good will
    Theas verses written heer,
  To honour vertue as I ought,
    And make his fame apeer,
  That whan the garland gay
    Of lawrel leaues but laet:
  Small is my pain, great is his prayes,
    That thus sutch honour gaet.

  Skeltonus grauidam reddebat forte puellam,
    Insigni forma quæ peperit puerum.
  Illico multorum fama hæc pervenit ad aures,
    Esse patrem nato sacrificum puero.
  Skeltonum facti non pœnitet aut pudet; ædes

“Not much vnlike to merrie Skelton, who thrust his wife out at the doore,
and receiued her in againe at the window. The storie is well known how
the bishop had charged him to thrust his wife out of the doore: but that
which was but a meriment in Skelton,” &c. p. 99.

“So that the leape yeare, for any thing I see, might well vse the defence
of merie Skelton, who being a priest, and hauing a child by his wife,
euerie one cryed out, Oh, Skelton hath a child, fie on him, &c. Their
mouthes at that time he could not stop: but on a holy day, in a mery
mood, he brought the child to church with him, and in the pulpit stript
it naked, and held it out, saying, See this child: is it not a pretie
child, as other children be, euen as any of yours? hath it not legs,
armes, head, feet, limbes, proportioned euery way as it shuld be? If
Skelton had begot a monster, as a calfe, or such like, what a life should

From _The Life of Long Meg of Westminster: containing the mad merry
prankes she played in her life time, not onely in performing sundry
quarrels with diuers ruffians about London: But also how valiantly she
behaued her selfe in the warres of Bolloingne._ 1635. 4to. (Of this tract
there is said to have been a much earlier edition. I quote from the
reprint in _Miscellanea Antiqua Anglicana_, 1816.)

    “CHAP. II.

    Containing how he [the carrier] placed her in Westminster, and
    what shee did at her placing.

After the carrier had set vp his horse, and dispatcht his lading, hee
remembred his oath, and therefore bethought him how he might place these
three maides: with that hee called to minde that the mistresse at the
Eagle in Westminster had spoken diuers times to him for a seruant; he
with his carriage passed ouer the fields to her house, where he found her
sitting and drinking with a Spanish knight called sir James of Castile,
doctor Skelton, and Will Sommers; told her how hee had brought vp to
London three Lancashire lasses, and seeing she was oft desirous to haue
a maid, now she should take her choyce which of them she would haue.
Marry, quoth shee (being a very merry and a pleasant woman), carrier,
thou commest in good time; for not onely I want a maid, but heere bee
three gentlemen that shall giue me their opinions, which of them I shall
haue. With that the maids were bidden come in, and she intreated them to
giue their verdict. Streight as soone as they saw Long Meg, they began
to smile; and doctor Skelton in his mad merry veine, blessing himselfe,
began thus:

  _Domine, Domine, vnde hoc?_
  What is she in the gray cassock?
  Me thinkes she is of a large length,
  Of a tall pitch, and a good strength,
  With strong armes and stiffe bones;
  This is a wench for the nones:
  Her lookes are bonny and blithe,
  She seemes neither lither nor lithe,
  But young of age,
  And of a merry visage,
  Neither beastly nor bowsie,
  Sleepy nor drowsie,
  But faire fac’d and of a good size;
  Therefore, hostesse, if you be wise,
  Once be ruled by me,
  Take this wench to thee;
  For this is plaine,
  Shee’l doe more worke than these twaine:
  I tell thee, hostesse, I doe not mocke;
  Take her in the gray cassocke.

What is your opinion? quoth the hostesse to sir James of Castile.
Question with her, quoth he, what she can do, and then Ile giue you mine
opinion: and yet first, hostesse, aske Will Sommers opinion. Will smiled,
and swore that his hostesse should not haue her, but king Harry should
buy her. Why so, Will? quoth doctor Skelton. Because, quoth Will Sommers,
that she shall be kept for breed; for if the king would marry her to
long Sanders of the court, they would bring forth none but souldiers.
Well, the hostesse demanded what her name was. Margaret, forsooth,
quoth she. And what worke can you doe? Faith, little, mistresse, quoth
she, but handy labour, as to wash and wring, to make cleane a house, to
brew, bake, or any such drudgery: for my needle, to that I haue beene
little vsed to. Thou art, quoth the hostesse, a good lusty wench, and
therefore I like thee the better: I haue here a great charge, for I
keepe a victualling house, and diuers times there come in swaggering
fellowes, that, when they haue eat and dranke, will not pay what they
call for: yet if thou take the charge of my drinke, I must be answered
out of your wages. Content, mistresse, quoth she; for while I serue you,
if any stale cutter comes in, and thinkes to pay the shot with swearing,
hey, gogs wounds, let me alone! Ile not onely (if his clothes be worth
it) make him pay ere hee passe, but lend him as many bats as his crag
will carry, and then throw him out of doores. At this they all smiled.
Nay, mistresse, quoth the carrier, ’tis true, for my poore pilch here
is able with a paire of blew shoulders to sweare as much; and with that
he told them how she had vsed him at her comming to London. I cannot
thinke, quoth sir James of Castile, that she is so strong. Try her, quoth
Skelton, for I haue heard that Spaniards are of wonderfull strength. Sir
James in a brauery would needs make experience, and therefore askt the
maide if she durst change a box on the eare with him. I, sir, quoth she,
that I dare, if my mistresse will giue me leaue. Yes, Meg, quoth she;
doe thy best. And with that it was a question who should stand first:
Marry, that I will, sir, quoth she; and so stood to abide sir James his
blow; who, forcing himselfe with all his might, gaue her such a box that
she could scarcely stand, yet shee stirred no more than a post. Then sir
James he stood, and the hostesse willed her not spare her strength. No,
quoth Skelton; and if she fell him downe, Ile giue her a paire of new
hose and shoone. Mistresse, quoth Meg (and with that she strooke vp her
sleeue), here is a foule fist, and it hath past much drudgery, but, trust
me, I thinke it will giue a good blow: and with that she raught at him
so strongly, that downe fell sir James at her feet. By my faith, quoth
Will Sommers, she strikes a blow like an oxe, for she hath strooke down
an asse. At this they all laught. Sir James was ashamed, and Meg was
entertained into seruice.”

    “CHAP. IV.

    Containing the merry skirmish that was betweene her and sir
    James of Castile, a Spanish knight, and what was the end of
    their combat.

There was a great suter to Meg’s mistresse, called sir James of Castile,
to winne her loue: but her affection was set on doctor Skelton; so that
sir James could get no grant of any fauour. Whereupon he swore, if hee
knew who were her paramour, hee would runne him thorow with his rapier.
The mistresse (who had a great delight to bee pleasant) made a match
betweene her and Long Meg, that she should goe drest in gentlemans
apparell, and with her sword and buckler goe and meet sir James in Saint
Georges field[s]; if she beat him, she should for her labour haue a
new petticote. Let me alone, quoth Meg; the deuill take me if I lose
a petticote. And with that her mistris deliuered her a suit of white
sattin, that was one of the guards that lay at her house. Meg put it
on, and tooke her whinyard by her side, and away she went into Saint
Georges fields to meet sir James. Presently after came sir James, and
found his mistris very melancholy, as women haue faces that are fit for
all fancies. What aile you, sweetheart? quoth he; tell me; hath any man
wronged you? if he hath, be he the proudest champion in London, Ile
haue him by the eares, and teach him to know, sir James of Castile can
chastise whom he list. Now, quoth she, shall I know if you loue me: a
squaring long knaue, in a white sattin doublet, hath this day monstrously
misused me in words, and I haue no body to reuenge it; and in a brauery
went out of doores, and bad the proudest champion I had come into Saint
Georges fields and quit my wrong, if they durst: now, sir James, if euer
you loued mee, learne the knaue to know how he hath wronged me, and I
will grant whatsoeuer you will request at my hands. Marry, that I will,
quoth he; and for that you may see how I will vse the knaue, goe with
me, you and master doctor Skelton, and be eye-witnesses of my manhood.
To this they agreed; and all three went into Saint Georges fields, where
Long Meg was walking by the wind-mils. Yonder, quoth she, walkes the
villain that abused me. Follow me, hostesse, quoth sir James; Ile goe
to him. As soone as hee drew nigh, Meg began to settle herselfe, and so
did sir James: but Meg past on as though she would haue gone by. Nay,
sirrah, stay, quoth sir James; you and I part not so, we must haue a
bout ere we passe; for I am this gentlewomans champion, and flatly for
her sake will haue you by the eares. Meg replied not a word; but only
out with her sword: and to it they went. At the first bout Meg hit him
on the hand, and hurt him a little, but endangered him diuers times, and
made him giue ground, following so hotly, that shee strucke sir James’
weapon out of his hand; then when she saw him disarm’d, shee stept within
him, and, drawing her ponyard, swore all the world should not saue him.
Oh, saue mee, sir! quoth hee; I am a knight, and ’tis but for a womans
matter; spill not my blood. Wert thou twenty knights, quoth Meg, and
were the king himselfe heere, hee should not saue thy life, vnlesse thou
grant mee one thing. Whatsoeuer it bee, quoth sir James. Marry, quoth
shee, that is, that this night thou wait on my trencher at supper at
this womans house; and when supper is done, then confesse me to be thy
better at weapon in any ground in England. I will do it, sir, quoth he,
as I am a true knight. With this they departed, and sir James went home
with his hostesse sorrowfull and ashamed, swearing that his adversary was
the stoutest man in England. Well, supper was prouided, and sir Thomas
Moore and diuers other gentlemen bidden thither by Skeltons means, to
make vp the jest; which when sir James saw inuited, hee put a good face
on the matter, and thought to make a slight matter of it, and therefore
beforehand told sir Thomas Moore what had befallen him, how entring in
a quarrell of his hostesse, hee fought with a desperate gentleman of
the court, who had foiled him, and giuen him in charge to wait on his
trencher that night. Sir Thomas Moore answered sir James, that it was no
dishonour to be foyled by a gentleman [of England?], sith Cæsar himselfe
was beaten backe by their valour. As thus they were discanting of the
valour of Englishmen, in came Meg marching in her mans attire: euen as
shee entered in at the doore, This, sir Thomas Moore, quoth sir James, is
that English gentleman whose prowesse I so highly commend, and to whom in
all valour I account myselfe so inferiour. And, sir, quoth shee, pulling
off her hat, and her haire falling about her eares, hee that so hurt him
to day is none other but Long Meg of Westminster; and so you are all
welcome. At this all the company fell in a great laughing, and sir James
was amazed that a woman should so wap him in a whinyard: well, hee as the
rest was faine to laugh at the matter, and all that supper time to wait
on her trencher, who had leaue of her mistris that shee might be master
of the feast; where with a good laughter they made good cheere, sir James
playing the proper page, and Meg sitting in her maiesty. Thus was sir
James disgraced for his loue, and Meg after counted for a proper woman.”

be a rehearsal previous to its performance before Henry the Eighth,
Skelton acts the part of Friar Tuck.—In _The Death of Robert, Earle
of Hvntington_, &c. (by Anthony Munday and Henry Chettle), 1601, 4to,
which forms a Second Part to the drama just described, Skelton, though
his name is not mentioned throughout it, is still supposed to act the
Friar.—_Miscellanea_, written out by “Joħnes Mauritius” between 1604
and 1605—_MS. Reg. 12. B._ v.—contains (at fol. 14), and attributes to
Skelton, a well-known indelicate _jeu d’esprit._—_Pimlyco, or Runne
Red-Cap._ _Tis a mad world at Hogsdon_, 1609, 4to. Besides a notice
of Skelton, this poem contains two long quotations from his _Elynour
Rummyng_.—_Cornv-copiæ. Pasquils Night-Cap: Or Antidot for the Head-ache_
(by Samuel Rowlands), 1612, 4to, at sig. O 2 and sig. Q 3. The second
notice of Skelton in this poem is as follows;

  “And such a wondrous troupe the Hornpipe treads,
  One cannot passe another for their heads,
  That shortly we shall haue (_as Skelton iests_)
  A greater sort of horned men than beasts:”

but I recollect nothing in his works to which the allusion can be
applied.—_An Halfe-pennyworth of Wit, in a Penny-worth of Paper. Or, The
Hermites Tale. The third Impression._ 1613, 4to. At p. 16 of this poem
is a tale said to be “in Skeltons rime”—to which, however, it bears no
resemblance.—_The Shepheards Pipe_ (by Browne and Withers), 1614, 12mo,
in Eglogue i., at sig. C 7.—_Hypercritica; or A Rule of Judgment for
writing, or reading our History’s_, &c. _By Edmund Bolton, Author of Nero
Cæsar_ (published by Dr. Anthony Hall together with _Nicolai Triveti
Annalium Continuatio_, &c.), 1722, 8vo, at p. 235. At what period Bolton
wrote this treatise is uncertain: he probably completed it about 1618;
see Haslewood’s Preface to _Anc. Crit. Essays_, &c. ii. xvi.—_Poems: By
Michael Drayton Esqvire_, n. d. folio, at p. 283.—_The Golden Fleece
Diuided into three Parts_, &c., _by Orpheus Junior_ [Sir William
Vaughan], 1626, 4to, at pp. 83, 88, 93, of the Third Part. In this piece
“Scogin and _Skelton_” figure as “the chiefe Aduocates for the Dogrel
Rimers by the procurement of Zoilus, Momus, and others of the Popish
Sect.”—_The Fortunate Isles, and their Union. Celebrated in a Masque
designed for the Court, on the Twelfth-night_, 1626, by Ben Jonson. In
this masque are introduced “Skogan and _Skelton_, in like habits as they
lived:” see Jonson’s _Works_, viii. ed. Gifford: see also his _Tale of a
Tub_ (licensed 1633), _Works_, vi. 231.—_Wit and Fancy In a Maze. Or the
Incomparable Champion of Love and Beautie. A Mock-Romance_, &c. _Written
originally in the British Tongue, and made English by a person of much
Honor. Si foret in terris rideret Democritus._[148] 1656, 12mo. In this
romance (p. 101) we are told that “[In Elysium] the Brittish Bards
(forsooth) were also ingaged in quarrel for Superiority; and who think
you threw the Apple of Discord amongst them, but Ben Johnson, who had
openly vaunted himself the first and best of English Poets ... _Skelton_,
Gower, and the Monk of Bury were at Daggers-drawing for Chawcer:” and
a marginal note on “Skelton” informs us that he was “Henry 4. his Poet
Lawreat, who wrote disguises for the young Princes”!

[148] Such is the title-page of the copy now before me: but some copies
(see _Restituta_, iv. 196) are entitled _Don Zara del Fogo_, &c. 1656;
and others _Romancio-Mastix, or a Romance of Romances_, &c. _By Samuel
Holland. Gent._ 1660.

words “Skelton Poeta,” and at bottom the following verses;

the volume are thus enumerated;

    “_Workes of Skelton newly collected by I.S. as foloweth._

    1. The crowne of lawrel.

How the very dull poem (31) by William Cornishe came to be inserted in

(with a better text) in _MS. Reg. 18. D_ ii. where it immediately
precedes Skelton’s verses on the Death of the Earl of Northumberland.

       *       *       *       *       *

Of Skelton’s drama, _The Nigramansir_, the following account is given by
Warton:—

“I cannot quit Skelton, of whom I yet fear too much has been already
said, without restoring to the public notice a play, or MORALITY,
written by him, not recited in any catalogue of his works, or annals
of English typography; and, I believe, at present totally unknown to
the antiquarians in this sort of literature. It is, _The NIGRAMANSIR,
a moral ENTERLUDE and a pithie written by Maister SKELTON laureate and
plaid before the king and other estatys at Woodstoke on Palme Sunday_. It
was printed by Wynkin de Worde in a thin quarto, in the year 1504.[149]
It must have been presented before king Henry the seventh, at the
royal manor or palace, at Woodstock in Oxfordshire, now destroyed. The
characters are a Necromancer or conjuror, the devil, a notary public,
Simonie, and Philargyria or Avarice. It is partly a satire on some abuses
in the church; yet not without a due regard to decency, and an apparent
respect for the dignity of the audience. The story, or plot, is the tryal
of SIMONY and AVARICE: the devil is the judge, and the notary public acts
as an assessor or scribe. The prisoners, as we may suppose, are found
guilty, and ordered into hell immediately. There is no sort of propriety
in calling this play the Necromancer: for the only business and use of
this character, is to open the subject in a long prologue, to evoke the
devil, and summon the court. The devil kicks the necromancer, for waking
him so soon in the morning: a proof that this drama was performed in the
morning, perhaps in the chapel of the palace. A variety of measures,
with shreds of Latin and French, is used: but the devil speaks in the
octave stanza. One of the stage-directions is, _Enter Balsebub with a
Berde_. To make him both frightful and ridiculous, the devil was most
commonly introduced on the stage wearing a visard with an immense beard.
Philargyria quotes Seneca and saint Austin: and Simony offers the devil a
bribe. The devil rejects her offer with much indignation: and swears by
the _foule Eumenides_, and the hoary beard of Charon, that she shall be
well fried and roasted in the unfathomable sulphur of Cocytus, together
with Mahomet, Pontius Pilate, the traitor Judas, and king Herod. The last
scene is closed with a view of hell, and a dance between the devil and
the necromancer. The dance ended, the devil trips up the necromancer’s
heels, and disappears in fire and smoke.” _Hist. of E.P._ ii. 360. ed.
4to.

[149] “My lamented friend Mr. William Collins, whose Odes will be
remembered while any taste for true poetry remains, shewed me this piece
at Chichester, not many months before his death: and he pointed it out as
a veryrare and valuable curiosity. He intended to write the HISTORY OF
THE RESTORATION OF LEARNING UNDER LEO THE TENTH, and with a view to that
design, had collected many scarce books. Some few of these fell into my
hands at his death. The rest, among which, I suppose, was this INTERLUDE,
were dispersed.”

       *       *       *       *       *

In the _Garlande of Laurell_ (vol. i. 408, sqq.) Skelton enumerates many
of his compositions which are no longer extant.

For the following account of this MS. I am indebted to Mr. Thomas Wright:—

                     “MS. Corp. Chr. Camb. No. 357.

At the head of the first folio—‘Interpretatio Skeltoni poetæ Laureati,’
written in a different hand from the MS. (by Nasmith said to be by Archb.
Parker himself) over something which has been erased, but which seems to
have been ‘Prohemye of Poggius.’

At the end of this preface is written in the same hand as MS. ‘Thus
endeth the prohemye of Poggius.’ fol. 2 verso.

At fol. 3 begins ‘The prohemy of Diodorus thauctour.’ This ends at fol. 7
thus,—

¶ ‘Now we wyll enforce to begynne our processe historyall. quod Skelton.

¶ Here endeth the prohemy of all the hole processe.’

The words ‘quod Skelton’ are written in rather a different hand, and with
different ink, but apparently contemporary. I think it not impossible
that they may have been added by the original hand at another time.

It is imperfect at the end: but on a leaf bound up with it is written in
a much later hand (perhaps by Parker), ‘Hec charta de industria vacua
relicta est, ut occasio daretur juveni in litteris exercitato aggrediendi
translationem historiæ que hic diminuta est, ut sic humeri sui vires
experiatur quid ferre valeant, quidve recusent, tum cognoscet quid hic
translator prestiterit, fortassis non ita facile in hoc genere a multis
superandus.’”

Tanner (_Biblioth._ p. 676. ed. 1748) mentions the following two pieces
as extant in his day among the MSS. of Lincoln Cathedral Library (see
_Memoir_, pp. xxi, xxiii.)—

principi, postea Henr._ viii, _missa_, Dat. apud Eltham A.D. MDI.

EXTRACTS FROM PIECES WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN, OR WHICH CONTAIN EXAMPLES OF,

EXAMPLES OF THE METRE CALLED SKELTONICAL.

    _The Genealogye of Heresye. Compyled by Ponce Pantolabus.
    Imprynted at London In Pater noster rowe. At the signe of our
    ladye pytye_ [some copies, _our fadyr Pyte_] _By Johan Redman.

    by Robert Wyer: vide _Typograph. Antiq._ iii. 59, 182. ed.
    Dibdin (the size of them not mentioned). The author was John
    Huntingdon.

These editions I have not seen: the whole of the tract, however, seems
to be quoted in _A mysterye of inyquyte contayned within the heretycall
Genealogye of Ponce Pantolabus, is here both dysclosed & confuted By
Johan Bale An. M.D.XLII._ 12mo, Geneva, 1545, from which I subjoin the
following passages:

  “Blynde obstynacye

  Of dame ignoraunce.
  Heresye begate

  After this brother
  Came forth an other;

  He and his cumpanye
  Began in Germanye.
  And after that
  Came in a gnat
  Of the same kynde,

  Next after him,
  Is his chefe lym

  “Wyll none in all this lande
  Step forth, and take in hande
  These felowes to withstande,
  In nombre lyke the sande,
  That with the Gospell melles,
  And wyll do nothynge elles
  But tratlynge tales telles
  Agaynst our holy prelacie
  And holy churches dygnitie,
  Sayinge it is but papistrie,
  Yea, fayned and hipocrisy,
  Erronious and heresye,
  And taketh theyr aucthoritie
  Out of the holy Euangelie,
  All customes ceremoniall
  And rytes ecclesiasticall,
  Not grounded on Scripture,
  No longer to endure?
  And thus, ye maye be sure,
  The people they alure
  And drawe them from your lore,
  The whiche wyll greve you sore;
  Take hede, I saye, therfore,
  Your nede was neuer more.
  But sens ye be so slacke,
  It greueth me, alacke,
  To heare behynde your backe
  Howe they wyll carpe and cracke,
  And none of you that dare

  With penne and ynke and paper,

  To touche these felowes indede
  With all expedient spede,
  And not before it nede:
  And I indede am he
  That wayteth for to se
  Who dare so hardy be
  To encounter here with me;
  I stande here in defence
  Of some that be far hence,
  And can both blysse and sence,
  And also vndertake
  Ryght holy thynges to make,
  Yea, God within a cake;
  And who so that forsake
  His breade shall be dowe bake;
  I openly professe
  The holy blyssed masse
  Of strength to be no lesse
  Then it was at the fyrst:
  But I wolde se who durst

  For he shulde be accurst
  With boke, bell, and candell,
  And so I wolde hym handell
  That he shulde ryght well knowe
  Howe to escape, I trowe,
  So hardy on his heade,
  Depraue our holy breade,
  Or els to prate or patter
  Agaynst our holy watter.
  This is a playne matter,
  It nedeth not to flatter:
  They be suche holy thynges
  As hath ben vsed with kynges;
  And yet these lewde loselles,
  That bragge vpon theyr Gospelles,
  At ceremonies swelles,

  They saye ye leade euyll lyues

  And so your sede is sowne
  In other mennes grounde,
  True wedlocke to confounde:
  Thus do they rayle and raue,
  Callynge euery priest knaue,
  That loueth messe to saye,
  And after ydle all daye:
  They wolde not haue you playe
  To dryue the tyme awaye,
  But brabble on the Byble,
  Whiche is but impossible
  To be learned in all your lyfe;
  Yet therin be they ryfe,
  Whiche maketh all this stryfe,” &c.

From _The Vpcheringe of the Messe: Inprinted at Lōdon by John Daye and
Willyam Seres_, 12mo, n. d.

  “Who hath not knowen or herd
  How we were made afeard
  That, magre of our beard,
  Our messe shulde cleane awaye,
  That we did dayly saye,
  And vtterly decaye
  For euer and for aye?
  So were we brought in doubte
  That all that are deuout
  Were like to go withoute
  The messe that hath no peere,
  Which longe hath taried here,
  Yea, many an hundreth yere,
  And to be destitute
  Of that whiche constitute
  Was of the highe depute
  Of Christe and his apostles;
  Althoughe none of the Gospels
  No mention maketh or tells,
  We must beleue (what ells?)
  Of things done by councells,
  Wherein the high professours,
  Apostlique successours,
  Take holde to be possessours;
  And some were made confessours;
  Some of them were no startars,
  But were made holi marters:
  Yet plowmen, smythes, & cartars,
  With such as be their hartars,
  Will enterprise to taxe
  Thes auncyent mens actes
  And holy fathers factes.
  Thoughe messe were made bi men,
  As popes nyne or ten,
  Or many more, what then?
  Or not of Scripture grounded,
  Is yt therfore confounded
  To be a supersticion?
  Nay, nay, they mysse the quission:
  Make better inquyssicion;
  Ye haue an euyll condicion
  To make suche exposicion;
  Ye thinke nothing but Scripture
  Is only clene and pure;
  Yes, yes, I you ensure,
  The messe shalbe hir better,
  As light as ye do set hir.
    The Scripture hath nothing
  Wherby profyte to bryng,
  But a lytyll preaching,
  With tattling and teaching;
  And nothing can ye espie
  Nor se with outwarde eye,
  But must your ears applie
  To learnyng inwardlye;
  And who so it will folowe,
  In goods though he may walow,
  If Scripture once him swalowe,
  She wyll vndo him holowe;
  Wherfore no good mes singers
  Will come within hir fyngers,
  But are hir vnder styngers,
  For she wolde fayne vndo
  All such as lyueth so.
    To the messe she is an enymye,
  And wolde distroye hir vtterlye,
  Wer not for sum that frendfully
  In time of nede will stand hir by.
  Yet is the messe and she as lyke
  As a Christian to an heretike:
  The messe hath holy vestures,
  And many gay gestures,
  And decked with clothe of golde,
  And vessells many folde,
  Right galaunt to beholde,
  More then may well be tolde,
  With basen, ewer, and towell,
  And many a prety jwelle,
  With goodly candellstyckes,
  And many proper tryckys,
  With cruetts gilt and chalys,
  Wherat some men haue malice,
  With sensers, and with pax,
  And many other knackys,
  With patent, and with corporas,
  The fynest thing that euer was.
  Alasse, is it not pitie
  That men be no more wittye
  But on the messe to iest,
  Of all suche thinge the best?
  For if she were supprest,
  A pyn for all the rest.
  ...
  A, good mestres Missa,
  Shal ye go from vs thissa?
  Wel, yet I muste ye kissa:
  Alacke, for payne I pyssa,
  To se the mone here issa,
  Because ye muste departe!
  It greueth many an herte
  That ye should from them start:
  But what then? tushe, a farte!
  Sins other shifte is none,
  But she must neades be gone,
  Nowe let vs synge eche one,
  Boeth Jak and Gyll and Jone,
  _Requiem eternam_,
  Lest _penam sempiternam_
  For _vitam supernam_,
  And _vmbram infernam_
  For _veram lucernam_,
  She chaunce to enherite,
  According to hir merite.
    _Pro cuius memoria_
  Ye maye wel be soria;
  Full smale maye be your _gloria_,
  When ye shal heare thys storia;
  Then wil ye crie and roria,
  We shal se[151] hir no moria:
  _Et dicam vobis quare_
  She may no longer _stare_,
  Nor here with you _regnare_,
  But trudge _ad vltra mare_,
  And after _habitare_
  _In regno Plutonico_
  _Et euo acronyco,_
  _Cum cetu Babilonico_
  _Et cantu diabolico_,
  With pollers and piller[s],
  And al hir well willers,
  And ther to dwel euer:
  And thus wil I leaue hir.”

From _Phylogamus_, 12mo, without date or printer’s name—of which the
title-page and five leaves are preserved in a volume of Ballads and
Fragments in the British Museum. The late Mr. Douce has written below the
title-page “Probably by Skelton;” but it is certainly not his.

  “Gyue place, ye poetes fine,

  For nowe yᵉ Muses nyne,
  So sacred and diuine,

  To thee the goddes prudente

  Thou wrytest thynges dyffuse,

  Obfuscate and obtuse;
  No man the lyke doth use
  Among the Turckes or Jewes;
  Alwayes inuentyng newes
  That are incomparable,
  They be so fyrme and stable:
  Lyke as a shyppe is able,

  In wynde, weather, or hayle,
  To guyde both top and tayle,
  And not the course to fayle;

  As wel by darke as day,
  And neuer go astray,

  Insolent and insensate,
  Contendyng and condensate,
  Obtused and obturate,

without date or printer’s name on the title-page: the copy now before
me is imperfect at the end, where perhaps both are given. According to
Herbert’s _Ames’s Typ. Antiq._ iii. 1582, this piece was printed in 1555.

In the two subjoined passages (perhaps in more) of this tract, the author
adopts the Skeltonic metre, though the whole is printed as prose:—

“There be many other noble menne [among the Spaniards, besides the duke
of Medena-zelie] vndoubtedly very wise and politik, which can throughe
their wisdome binde themselues for a time from their nature, and applye
their condicions to the maners of those menne with whom they would
gladlye bee frended; whose mischeuouse maners a man shal neuer knowe,
till he come vnder their subiection. But then shall ye perceiue perfectly
their puffed pride, with many mischeffes beside, their prowling and
poling, their bribinge and shauing, their most deceitfull dealing, their
braging and bosting, their flatteringe and faininge, their abominable
whorehuntynge, with most rufull ruling, | their doings vniust, | with
insaciate lust, | their stout stubbernnes, | croked crabbednes, | and
vnmeasurable madnes, | in enui, pride, and lecherie, | which, thei
saie, God loueth hartelie, | vaineglorie and hipocrisie, | with al
other vilanie | of what kinde soeuer it be; | supersticion, desolacion,
extorcion, adulacion, dissimulacion, exaltacion, suppression, inuocacion,
and all abominacion; with innumerable moe mischeues, whiche I coulde
plainlie declare, that no nacion in the world can suffer. Their masking
and mumbling | in the holi time of lent | maketh many wiues brente, | the
king being present, | nighte after nighte, | as a prince of moste mighte,
| which hath power in his hande | that no man dare withstande: | yet if
that were the greatest euil, | we might suffer it wel, | for there is no
man liuing | but would suffer the king | to haue wife, sister, doughter,
maide and all, | bothe great & smal, | so many as he liste, | no man
would him resist; | but the worst of all the companie | muste haue my
wife priuelie, | when I am present bi; | this is more vilanie, | that one
muste kepe the dore; | will not that greue you sore? | & dare not speake
for your life, | when another hath youre wife,” | &c. Sig. B i.

“Ye wil say, the Spaniards kepe their olde rentaking: how can that be,
when euery poore man must pay yerely for euery chimney in his house, and
euery other place that is to make fire in, as ouen, fornes, and smithes
forge, a Frenche crowne? wil Englishmen, or can thei, suffer to be poled
and pilled moste miserably, in payeng continually suche poling pence
and intollerable tollages for all maner graine and breade, befe, beare
and mutton, goose, pigge and capone, henne, mallard and chicken, milk,
butter and chese, egges, apples & peares, | wine white and reade, | with

a shamefull thing; | tench, ele or conger; | this shall kepe vs vnder, |

From _Doctour Doubble Ale_,—12mo, without printer’s name or date.

  “Although I lacke intelligence,
  And can not skyll of eloquence,
  Yet wyll I do my diligence
  To say sumthing or I go hence,
  Wherein I may demonstrate
  The figure, gesture, and estate
  Of one that is a curate,
  That harde is and endurate,
  And ernest in the cause
  Of piuish popish lawes,
  That are not worth two strawes,
  Except it be with dawes,
  That knoweth not good from euels,
  Nor Gods worde from the deuels,
  Nor wyll in no wise heare
  The worde of God so cleare,
  But popishnes vpreare,
  And make the pope Gods peare.
  ...
  Now let vs go about
  To tell the tale out
  Of this good felow stout,
  That for no man wyll dout,
  But kepe his olde condicions
  For all the newe comyssions,
  And vse his supersticions,
  And also mens tradycions,
  And syng for dead folkes soules,
  And reade hys beaderolles,
  And all such thinges wyll vse
  As honest men refuse:
  But take hym for a cruse,
  And ye wyll tell me newes;
  For if he ons begyn,
  He leaueth nought therin;
  He careth not a pyn
  How much ther be wythin,
  So he the pot may wyn,
  He wyll it make full thyn;
  And wher the drinke doth please
  There wyll he take his ease,
  And drinke therof his fyll,
  Tyll ruddy be his byll;
  And fyll both cup and can,
  Who is so glad a man
  As is our curate than?
  I wolde ye knewe it, a curate
  Not far without Newgate;
  Of a parysh large
  The man hath mikle charge,
  And none within this border
  That kepeth such order,
  Nor one a this syde Nauerne
  Louyth better the ale tauerne:
  But if the drinke be small,
  He may not well withall;
  Tush, cast it on the wall!
  It fretteth out his gall;
  Then seke an other house,
  This is not worth a louse,
  As dronken as a mouse,
  _Monsyre gybet a vous!_
  And ther wyll byb and bouse,
  Tyll heuy be his brouse.
  ...
  Thus may ye beholde
  This man is very bolde,
  And in his learning olde
  Intendeth for to syt:
  I blame hym not a whyt,
  For it wolde vexe his wyt,
  And cleane agaynst his earning,
  To folow such learning
  As now a dayes is taught;
  It wolde sone bryng to naught
  His olde popish brayne,
  For then he must agayne
  Apply hym to the schole,
  And come away a fole,
  For nothing shulde he get,
  His brayne hath bene to het
  And with good ale so wet;
  Wherefore he may now set
  In feldes and in medes,
  And pray vpon his beades,
  For yet he hath a payre
  Of beades that be right fayre,
  Of corall, gete, or ambre,
  At home within his chambre;
  For in matins or masse
  Primar and portas,
  And pottes and beades,
  His lyfe he leades:
  But this I wota,
  That if ye nota
  How this _idiota_
  Doth folow the pota,
  I holde you a grota
  Ye wyll rede by rota
  That he may were a cota
  In Cocke Lorels[152] bota.
  Thus the durty doctour,
  The popes oune proctour,
  Wyll bragge and boost
  Wyth ale and a toost,
  And lyke a rutter
  Hys Latin wyll vtter,
  And turne and tosse hym,
  Wyth _tu non possum_

  Thus our _dominus_ dodkin

  It is pytie he is not able

  And all lusty drinkers,
  Or captayne or beddle
  Wyth dronkardes to meddle.
  Ye cannot, I am sure,
  For keping of a cure
  Fynde such a one well,
  If ye shulde rake hell:
  And therefore nowe
  No more to you,
  _Sed perlegas ista,_
  _Si velis, papista_;
  Farewell and adewe,

  And a tirlary typpe;
  Beware of the whyppe.”

_Homo natus._

  “_Homo natus_
  Came to heauen gatus.
  Sir, you doe come to latus,
  With your shorne patus:
  _Frequentia falsa Euangelii_,
  For the loue of your bealie,
  _Cum auro & argento_,
  You loued the rules of Lento,
  Whiche the Pope did inuento:
  You are _spurius de muliere_.
  Not legittimate nor lawful here:
  _O quam[153] venenosa pestis,_
  _Fur, periurus, latro, mechus,_
  _Homicidis[154] tantum decus!_
  _De salute animarum_,
  Of Christes flocke thou hadest small carum:
  Thou art _filius populi_:
  Go, go to _Constantinopoli_,
  To your maister the Turke;
  There shall you lurke
  Emong the heathen soules.
  Somtyme your shorne brethren of Poules
  Were as blacke as moules,
  With their cappes fower forked,
  Their shoes warme corked;
  Nosed like redde grapes,
  Constant as she apes,
  In nature like blacke monkes,
  And shoote in sparowes trunkes,
  And boule when thei haue dinde,
  And kepe them from the winde;
  And thei whiche are not able
  Doe sitte still at the table,
  With colour scarlet pale,
  So small is their good ale:
  Thus from God thei did tourne,
  Long before their church did burne.
  Then when riche men wer sicke,
  Either dedde or quicke,
  _Valde diligenter notant_
  _Vbi diuites egrotant;_
  _Ibi currunt, nec cessabunt_
  _Donec ipsos tumilabunt;_
  _Oues alienas tondunt,_
  _Et perochias confundunt._
  These felowes pilde as ganders,
  Muche like the friers of Flanders,
  Whiche serue Sathan about the cloisters,
  Thei loue red wine and oisters.
  _Qui vult Satanæ seruire,_
  _Claustrum debet introire_,
  And euer haue suche an hedde
  As bastarde Boner that is dedde.
  He would for the Pope take pain;
  Therfore help, you friers of Spain,
  You enquisiters, take paine:
  It is a greate maine
  Vnto the Pope, your hedde,
  That Boner is thus dedde,
  And buried in a misers graue,
  Like a common k[naue].
  Lo, lo, now is he dedde,
  That was so well fedde,
  And had a softe bedde!
  _Estote fortis in bello_,
  Good Hardyng and thy fellowe;
  If you be papistes right,
  Come steale hym awaie by night,
  And put hym in a shrine;
  He was the Popes deuine;
  Why, shall he be forgotten,
  And lye still and rotten?
  Come on, and doe not fainte;
  Translate with spede your sainct,
  And put hym in a tombe:
  His harte is now at Rome.
  Come forth, you loughtes of Louen,
  And steale awaie this slouen:
  You are so full of ire,
  And popishe desire,
  And Romishe derision,
  And hellishe deuision,
  Therefore I am sure
  Your kyngdome will not dure.”

  Sig. B iii.

              “_Responde._
  _Ne recorderis peccata_,
  But open heauen gata,
  Sainct Peter, with your kaies;
  Shewe my lorde the right waies:
  He dwelt ones at Poules,
  And had cure of our soules:
  I wisse, he was not a baste,
  But holie, meke, and chaste;
  It is a greate pitie
  That he is gone from our citie;
  A man of greate honor;
  O holy sainct Boner!
  You blessed friers
  That neuer wer liers,
  And you holy nunnes
  That neuer had sonnes,
  Set this child of grace
  In some angelles place.”

  Which doth dispise

  O waspish king,
  Wheres now thy sting,

  And beare the sway
  By night and day,
  To thy dismay,
  In battle aray,
  And every fray?
  O pufte with pride,
  What foolish guide
  Made thee provide
  To over-ride
  This land so wide
  From side to side,
  And then, vntride,
  Away to slide,
  And not to abide,
  But all in a ring
  Away to fling?
  O conquering,

  With fast flying,
  And no replying,
  For feare of frying!
  ...
  But who but Philippus,
  That seeketh to nip vs,
  To rob vs, and strip vs,
  And then for to whip vs,
  Would ever haue ment,
  Or had intent,
  Or hither sent
  Such ships of charge,
  So strong and so large,
  Nay, the worst barge,
  Trusting to treason,
  And not to reason,
  Which at that season
  To him was geson,
  As doth appeare
  Both plaine and cleare
  To far and neere,
  To his confusion,
  By this conclusion,
  Which thus is framed,
  And must be named

  _Cum horrore et timore?_
  If one Drake o,
  One poore snake o,
  Make vs shake o,
  Tremble and quake o,
  Were it not, trow yee,

  With such a lande,
  That is so mande,
  Wherein there be
  Of certaintie
  As hungrie as he
  Many a thousand more,
  That long full sore
  For Indian golde,
  Which makes men bolde?” &c.

A poem called _Philargyrie of greate Britayne_, 1551, printed (and no
doubt written) by Robert Crowly, has been frequently mentioned as a
“Skeltonic” composition, but improperly, as the following lines will shew;

  “Geue eare awhyle,
  And marke my style,
  You that hath wyt in store;
  For wyth wordes bare
  I wyll declare
  Thyngs done long tyme before.
    Sometyme certayne
  Into Britayne,
  A lande full of plentie,
  A gyaunte greate
  Came to seke meate,
  Whose name was Philargyrie,” &c.

“See also,” says Warton (_Hist. of E. P._ ii. 358, note, ed. 4to), “a
doggrel piece of this kind, _in imitation of Skelton_, introduced into
Browne’s _Sheperd’s Pipe_,”—a mistake; for the poem of Hoccleve (inserted
in _Eglogue_ i.), to which Warton evidently alludes, is neither doggrel
nor in Skelton’s manner.




POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN SKELTON.




OF THE DEATH[155] OF THE NOBLE PRINCE, KYNGE EDWARDE THE FORTH, PER
SKELTONIDEM LAUREATUM.


  _Miseremini mei_, ye that be my frendis!
    This world[156] hath formed me downe to fall:
  How may[157] I endure, when that eueri thyng endis?
    What creature is borne to be eternall?
    Now there[158] is no more but pray for me all:
  Thus say I Edward, that late was youre kynge,
    And twenty two[159] yeres ruled this imperyall,
  Some vnto pleasure, and some to no lykynge:
  Mercy I aske of my mysdoynge;
    What auayleth it,[160] frendes, to be my foo,                       10
  Sith I can not resyst, nor amend your complaining?
    _Quia, ecce, nunc in pulvere dormio!_

  I slepe now in molde, as it is naturall
    That[161] erth vnto erth hath his reuerture:
  What ordeyned God to be terestryall,
    Without recours to the erth[162] of nature?
    Who to lyue euer may himselfe assure?[163]
  What is it[164] to trust on mutabilyte,
    Sith that in this world nothing may indure?
  For now am I gone, that late was in prosperyte:                       20
  To presume thervppon, it is but a vanyte,
    Not certayne, but as a cheryfayre[165] full of wo:
  Reygned not I of late in greate felycite?
    _Et, ecce, nunc in pulvere dormio!_

  Where was in my lyfe such one as I,
    Whyle lady Fortune with me had continuaunce?
  Graunted not she me to haue victory,
    In England to rayne, and to contribute Fraunce?
    She toke me by the hand and led me a daunce,
  And with her sugred lyppes on me she smyled;                          30
    But, what for her dissembled countenaunce,
  I coud not beware tyl I was begyled:
  Now from this world she hath me excyled,
    When I was lothyst hens for to go,
  And I am in age but, as who sayth, a chylde,
    _Et, ecce, nunc in pulvere dormio!_
  I se wyll,[166] they leve that doble my ȝeris:
    This[167] dealid this world with me as it lyst,[168]
  And hathe me made, to ȝow that be my perys,
    Example to thynke on Had I wyst:                                    40
    I storyd my cofers and allso my chest[169]
  With taskys takynge of the comenalte;
    I toke ther tresure, but of ther prayȝeris mist;
  Whom I beseche with pure humylyte
  For to forgeve and have on me pety;
    I was ȝour kynge, and kept ȝow from ȝowr foo:
  I wold now amend, but that wull not be,
    _[Quia,] ecce, nunc in pulvere dormio!_

  I had ynough, I held me not content,
    Without remembraunce that I should dye;                             50
  And more euer to incroche[170] redy was I bent,
    I knew not how longe I should it occupy:
    I made the Tower stronge, I wyst not why;
  I knew not to whom I purchased Tetersall;
    I amendid Douer on the mountayne hye,
  And London I prouoked to fortify the wall;
  I made Notingam a place full[171] royall,
    Wyndsore, Eltam,[172] and many other mo:
  Yet at the last I went from them all,
    _Et, ecce, nunc in pulvere dormio!_                                 60

  Where is now my conquest and victory?
    Where is my riches and my royal aray?
  Wher be my coursers and my horses hye?
    Where is my myrth, my solas, and my[173] play?
    As vanyte, to nought al is wandred[174] away.
  O lady Bes, longe for me may ye call!
    For I[175] am departed tyl domis day;
  But loue ye that Lorde that is soueraygne of all.
  Where be my castels and buyldynges royall?
    But Windsore alone, now I haue no mo,                               70
  And of Eton the prayers perpetuall,
    _Et, ecce, nunc in pulvere dormio!_

  Why should a man be proude or presume hye?
    Sainct Bernard therof nobly doth trete,
  Seyth a man is but[176] a sacke of stercorry,
    And shall returne vnto wormis mete.
    Why, what cam of Alexander the greate?
  Or els of stronge Sampson, who can tell?
    Were not[177] wormes ordeyned theyr flesh to frete?
  And of Salomon, that was of wyt the well?                             80
  Absolon profferyd his heare for to sell,
    Yet for al his bewte wormys ete him also;
  And I but late in honour dyd excel,
    _Et, ecce, nunc in pulvere dormio!_

  I haue played my pageyond, now am I past;
    Ye wot well all I was of no great yeld:
  This[178] al thing concluded shalbe at the last,
    When death approchyth, then lost is the felde:
    Then sythen this world me no longer vphelde,
  Nor nought[179] would conserue me here in my place,                   90
    _In manus tuas, Domine_, my spirite vp I yelde,
  Humbly[180] beseching thé, God, of thy[181] grace!
  O ye curtes commyns, your hertis vnbrace
    Benyngly now to pray for me also;
  For ryght wel you know your kyng I was,

SKELTON LAUREAT VPON THE DOULOUR[U]S DETHE AND MUCHE LAMENTABLE CHAUNCE
OF THE MOST HONORABLE ERLE OF NORTHUMBERLANDE.


  I wayle, I wepe, I sobbe, I sigh ful sore
    The dedely fate, the dolefulle desteny
  Of hym that is gone, alas, without restore,
    Of the bloud royall descending nobelly;
    Whose lordshyp doutles was slayne lamentably
  Thorow treson, again him compassed and wrought,
  Trew to his prince in word, in dede, and thought.

  Of heuenly poems, O Clyo, calde by name
    In the colege of Musis goddes hystoriall,
  Adres thé to me, whiche am both halt and lame                         10
    In elect vteraunce to make memoryall!
    To thé for souccour, to thé for helpe I call,
  Mine homely rudnes and dryghnes to expell
  With the freshe waters of Elyconys well.

  Of noble actes aunciently enrolde
    Of famous pryncis and lordes of astate,
  By thy report ar wont to be extold,
    Regestringe trewly euery formare date;
    Of thy bountie after the vsuall rate
  Kyndell in me suche plenty of thy nobles,                             20
  These sorowfulle dites that I may shew expres.

  In sesons past, who hath herde or sene
    Of formar writyng by any presidente
  That vilane hastarddis in their furious tene,
    Fulfylled with malice of froward entente,
    Confetered togeder of commonn[184] concente
  Falsly to slee[185] theyr moste singuler good lord?
  It may be regestrede of shamefull recorde.

  So noble a man, so valiaunt lord and knyght,
    Fulfilled with honor, as all the world[186] doth ken;               30
  At his commaundement which had both day and nyght
    Knyghtes and squyers, at euery season when
    He calde vpon them, as meniall houshold men:
  Were not[187] these commons vncurteis karlis of kind
  To slo their owne lord? God was not in their mynd.

  And were not they to blame, I say, also,
    That were aboute him, his o[w]ne[188] seruants of trust,
  To suffre him slayn of his mortall fo?
    Fled away from hym, let hym ly in the dust;
    They bode not till the reckenyng were discust:                      40
  What shuld I flatter? what shuld I glose or paint?
  Fy, fy for shame, their hartes were to faint.

  In England and Fraunce which gretly was redouted,
    Of whom both Flaunders and Scotland stode in drede,
  To whom great estates obeyed and lowted,
    A mayny of rude villayns made hym for to blede;
    Unkyndly they slew him, that holp[189] them oft at nede:
  He was their bulwark, their paues, and their wall,
  Yet shamfully they slew hym; that shame mot them befal!

  I say, ye comoners, why wer ye so stark mad?                          50
    What frantyk frensy fyll in your brayne?
  Where was your wit and reson ye should haue had?
    What wilful foly made yow to ryse agayne
    Your naturall lord? alas, I can not fayne:
  Ye armyd you with will, and left your wit behynd;
  Well may you[190] be called comones most vnkynd.

  He was your chefteyne, your shelde, your chef defence,
    Redy to assyst you in euery time of nede;
  Your worshyp depended of his excellence:
    Alas, ye mad men, to far ye did excede;                             60
    Your hap was vnhappy, to ill was your spede:
  What moued you againe him to war or to fyght?
  What alyde you to sle[191] your lord again all ryght?

  The ground of his quarel was for his souerain lord,
    The well concerning of all the hole lande,
  Demandyng suche duties as nedes most acord
    To the ryght of his prince, which shold not be withstand;
    For whose cause ye slew him with your owne hand:
  But had his noble men done wel that day,
  Ye had not bene able to haue sayd hym nay.                            70

  But ther was fals packing, or els I am begylde;
    How be it the mater was euydent and playne,
  For if they had occupied their spere and their shilde,
    This noble man doutles had not bene[192] slayne.
    But men say they wer lynked with a double chaine,
  And held with the comones vnder a cloke,
  Which kindeled the wild fyr that made al this smoke.

  The commons renyed ther taxes to pay,
    Of them demaunded and asked by the kynge;
  With one voice importune they plainly sayd nay;                       80
    They buskt them on a bushment themselfe in baile to bring,
    Againe the kyngs plesure to wrestle or to wring;
  Bluntly as bestis with boste and with crye
  They sayd they forsed not, nor carede not to dy.

  The nobelnes of the north, this valiant lord and knight,
    As man that was innocent of trechery or traine,
  Presed forth boldly to withstand the myght,
    And, lyke marciall Hector, he faught them agayne,
    Vygorously vpon them with might and with maine,
  Trustyng in noble men that were with him there;                       90
  But al they fled from hym for falshode or fere.

  Barones, knyghtes, squiers, one[193] and all,
    Together with seruauntes of his famuly,
  Turned their backis,[194] and let their master fal,
    Of whos [life] they[195] counted not a flye;
    Take vp whose wold, for ther[196] they let him ly.
  Alas, his gold, his fee, his annual rent
  Upon suche a sort was ille bestowd and spent!

  He was enuirond aboute on euery syde
    With his enemyes, that wer starke mad and wode;                    100
  Yet[197] while[198] he stode he gaue them woundes wyde:
    Allas for ruth! what thoughe his mynd wer gode,
    His corage manly, yet ther he shed his blode:
  Al left alone, alas, he foughte in vayne!
  For cruelly[199] among them ther he was slayne.

  Alas for pite! that Percy thus was spylt,
    The famous Erle of Northumberland;
  Of knyghtly prowes the sword, pomel, and hylt,
    The myghty lyon doutted by se and lande;[200]
    O dolorus chaunce of Fortunes froward hande!                       110
  What man, remembryng howe shamfully he was slaine,
  From bitter weping himself can restrain?

  O cruell Mars, thou dedly god of war!
    O dolorous tewisday, dedicate to thy name,
  When thou shoke thy sworde so noble a man to mar!
    O ground vngracious, vnhappy be thy fame,
    Which wert endyed with rede bloud of the same
  Most noble erle! O foule mysuryd ground,
  Whereon he gat his finall dedely wounde!

  O Atropos, of the fatall systers iii                                 120
    Goddes most cruel vnto the lyfe of man,
  All merciles, in thé is no pite!
    O homicide, which sleest all that thou can,
    So forcibly vpon this erle thou ran,
  That with thy sword, enharpit of mortall drede,
  Thou kit asonder his perfight vitall threde!

  My wordes vnpullysht be, nakide and playne,
    Of aureat poems they want ellumynynge;
  But by them to knowlege ye may attayne
    Of this lordes dethe and of his murdrynge;                         130
    Which whils he lyued had fuyson of euery thing,
  Of knights, of squyers, chyf lord of toure and towne,
  Tyl fykkell Fortune began on hym to frowne:

  Paregall to dukes, with kynges he might compare,
    Surmountinge in honor al erlis he did excede;
  To all countreis aboute hym reporte me I dare;
    Lyke to Eneas benigne in worde and dede,
    Valiant as Hector in euery marciall nede,
  Prouydent,[201] discrete, circumspect, and wyse,
  Tyll the chaunce ran agayne hym of Fortunes duble dyse.              140

  What nedeth me for to extoll his fame
    With my rude pen enkankered all with rust,
  Whose noble actes show worshiply his name,
    Transendyng far[202] myne homly Muse, that muste
    Yet somwhat wright supprised with herty[203] lust,
  Truly reportyng his right noble estate,
  Immortally whiche is immaculate?

  His noble blode neuer destayned was,
    Trew to his prince for to defend his ryght,
  Doblenes hatyng fals maters to compas,                               150
    Treytory and treason he banysht out of syght,
    With truth to medle was al his holl delyght,
  As all his countrey can testyfy the same:
  To sle[204] suche a lorde, alas, it was great shame!

  If the hole quere of the Musis nyne
    In me all onely wer set and comprysed,
  Enbrethed with the blast of influence deuyne,
    As perfytly as could be thought or deuised;
    To me also allthough it were promised
  Of laureat Phebus holy the eloquence,                                160
  All were to lytell for his magnificence.

  O yonge lyon, but tender yet of age,
    Grow and encrese, remembre thyn estate;
  God thé assyst unto thyn herytage,
    And geue thé grace to be more fortunate!
    Agayn rebellyones arme thé[205] to make debate;
  And, as the lyone, whiche is of bestes kynge,
  Unto thy subiectes be curteis and benygne.

  I pray God sende thé prosperous lyfe and long,
    Stable thy mynde constant to be and fast,                          170
  Ryght to mayntayn, and to resyst all wronge:
    All flateryng faytors abhor and from thé cast;
    Of foule detraction God kepe thé from the blast!
  Let double delyng in thé haue no place,
  And be not lyght of credence in no case.

  With heuy chere, with dolorous hart and mynd,
    Eche man may sorow in his inward thought
  This lordes[206] death, whose pere is hard to fynd,
    Algife Englond and Fraunce were thorow saught.
    Al kynges, all princes, al dukes, well they ought,                 180
  Both temporall and spiritual, for to complayne
  This noble man, that crewelly was slayne:

  More specially barons, and those knygtes bold,
    And al other gentilmen with him enterteyned
  In fee, as menyall men of his housold,
    Whom he as lord worshyply mainteyned;
    To sorowful weping they ought to be constreined,
  As oft as they call to theyr remembraunce
  Of ther good lord the fate and dedely chaunce.

  O[207] perlese Prince of heuen emperyall!                            190
    That with one word formed al thing of noughte;
  Heuen, hell, and erthe obey unto thy call;
    Which to thy resemblaunce wondersly hast wrought
    All mankynd, whom thou full dere hast bought,
  With thy bloud precious our finaunce thou did pay,
  And vs redemed from the fendys pray;

  To thé pray we, as Prince incomparable,
    As thou art of mercy and pyte the well,
  Thou bring unto thy joye eterminable
    The soull of this lorde from all daunger of hell,                  200
    In endles blys with thé to byde and dwell
  In thy palace aboue the orient,
  Where thou art Lord and God omnipotent.

  O quene of mercy, O lady full of grace,
    Mayden most pure, and Goddes moder dere,
  To sorowful hartes chef comfort and solace,
    Of all women O flowre withouten[208] pere!
    Pray to thy Son aboue the sterris clere,
  He to vouchesaf, by thy mediacion,
  To pardon thy seruaunt, and brynge to saluacion.                     210

  In joy triumphaunt the heuenly yerarchy,[209]
    With all the hole sorte of that glorious place,
  His soull mot receyue into theyr company,
    Thorow bounty of Hym that formed all solace;
    Wel of pite, of mercy, and of grace,
  The Father, the Sonn, and the Holy Ghost,
  In Trinitate one God of myghtes[210] moste!

  Of all nacyons vnder the heuyn,
    These frantyke foolys I hate most of all;
  For though they stumble in the synnys seuyn,
    In peuyshnes yet they[216] snapper and fall,
    Which men the viii dedly syn[217] call.
  This peuysh proud, thys prendergest,
  When he is well, yet can he not rest.

  A swete suger lofe and sowre bayardys bun
    Be sumdele lyke in forme and shap,
  The one for a duke, the other for dun,                                10
    A maunchet for morell theron to snap.
    Hys hart is to hy to haue any hap;
  But for in his gamut carp that he can,
  Lo, Jak wold be a jentylman!

  Wyth, Hey, troly, loly, lo, whip here, Jak,
    Alumbek sodyldym syllorym ben!
  Curyowsly he can both counter and knak
    Of Martyn Swart and all hys mery men.
    Lord, how Perkyn is proud of hys pohen!
  But ask wher he fyndyth among hys monacordys                          20
  An holy water clarke a ruler of lordys.

  He can not fynd it in rule nor in space:
    He solfyth to haute, hys trybyll is to hy;
  He braggyth of his byrth, that borne was full bace;
    Hys musyk withoute mesure, to sharp is hys my;
    He trymmyth in hys tenor to counter pyrdewy;
  His dyscant is besy, it is withoute a mene;
  To fat is hys fantsy, hys wyt is to lene.

  He lumbryth on a lewde lewte, Roty bully joyse,
    Rumbyll downe, tumbyll downe, hey go, now, now!                     30
  He fumblyth in hys fyngeryng an vgly good noyse,
    It semyth the sobbyng of an old sow:
    He wold be made moch of, and he wyst how;
  Wele sped in spyndels and turnyng of tauellys;
  A bungler, a brawler, a pyker of quarellys.

  Comely he clappyth a payre of clauycordys;
    He whystelyth so swetely, he makyth me to swete;
  His descant is dasshed full of dyscordes;
    A red angry man, but easy to intrete:
    An vssher of the hall fayn wold I get,                              40
  To poynte this proude page a place and a rome,
  For Jak wold be a jentylman, that late was a grome.

  Jak wold jet, and yet Jyll sayd nay;
    He counteth in his countenaunce to checke with the best:
  A malaperte medler that pryeth for his pray,
    In a dysh dare he rush at the rypest;
    Dremyng in dumpys to wrangyll and to wrest:
  He fyndeth a proporcyon in his prycke songe,
  To drynk at a draught a larg and a long.

  Nay, iape not with hym, he is no small fole,                          50
  It is a solemnpne syre and a solayne;
  For lordes and ladyes lerne at his scole;
    He techyth them so wysely to solf and to fayne,
    That neyther they synge wel prycke songe nor playne:
  Thys docter Deuyas[218] commensyd in a cart,
  A master, a mynstrell, a fydler, a farte.

  What though ye can cownter _Custodi nos_?
    As well it becomyth yow, a parysh towne clarke,
  To syng _Sospitati[219] dedit ægros_:
    Yet bere ye not to bold, to braule ne to bark                       60
    At me, that medeled nothyng with youre wark:
  Correct fyrst thy self; walk, and be nought!
  Deme what thou lyst, thou knowyst not my thought.

  A prouerbe of old, say well or be styll:
    Ye are to vnhappy occasyons[220] to fynde

  Ly styll, quod she, my paramoure,
    Ly styll hardely, and take a nap.
    Hys bed was heuy, such was his hap,
  All drowsy dremyng, dround in slepe,

    That halsyd her hartely and kyst her swete:
    Thus after her cold she cought a hete.
  My lefe, she sayd, rowtyth in hys bed;                                20
  I wys he hath an heuy bed,
                  Wyth, Hey, lullay, &c.

  What dremyst thou, drunchard, drousy pate!
    Thy lust and lykyng is from thé gone;
  Thou blynkerd blowboll, thou wakyst to late,
    Behold, thou lyeste, luggard, alone!
    Well may thou sygh, well may thou grone,
  To dele wyth her so cowardly:
  I wys, powle hachet, she bleryd thyne I.

  The auncient acquaintance, madam, betwen vs twayn,
    The famylyaryte, the formar dalyaunce,
  Causyth me that I can not myself refrayne
    But that I must wryte for my plesaunt pastaunce:
    Remembryng your passyng goodly countenaunce,
  Your goodly port, your bewteous visage,
  Ye may be countyd comfort of all corage.

  Of all your feturs fauorable to make tru discripcion,
    I am insuffycyent to make such enterpryse;
  For thus dare I say, without [con]tradiccyon,                         10
    That dame Menolope was neuer half so wyse:
    Yet so it is that a rumer begynnyth for to ryse,
  How in good horsmen ye set your hole delyght,
  And haue forgoten your old trew louyng knyght.

  Wyth bound and rebound, bounsyngly take vp
    Hys jentyll curtoyl,[227] and set nowght by small naggys!
  Spur vp at the hynder gyrth, with, Gup, morell, gup!
    With, Jayst ye, jenet of Spayne, for your tayll waggys!
    Ye cast all your corage vppon such courtly haggys.
  Haue in sergeaunt ferrour, myne horse behynde is bare;                20
  He rydeth well the horse, but he rydeth better the mare.

  Ware, ware, the mare wynsyth wyth her wanton hele!
    She kykyth with her kalkyns and keylyth with a clench;
  She goyth wyde behynde, and hewyth neuer a dele:
    Ware gallyng in the widders, ware of that wrenche!
    It is perlous for a horseman to dyg in the trenche.
  Thys greuyth your husband, that ryght jentyll knyght,
  And so with youre seruantys he fersly doth fyght.

  So fersly he fytyth, hys mynde is so fell,
    That he dryuyth them doune with dyntes on ther day wach;            30
  He bresyth theyr braynpannys and makyth them to swell,
    Theyre browys all to-brokyn, such clappys they cach;
    Whose jalawsy malycyous makyth them to lepe the hach;
  By theyr conusaunce knowing how they serue a wily py:
  Ask all your neybours whether that I ly.

  It can be no counsell that is cryed at the cros:
    For your jentyll husband sorowfull am I;
  How be it,[228] he is not furst hath had a los:
    Aduertysyng you, madame, to warke more secretly,
    Let not all the world make an owtcry;                               40

HERE BEGYNNETH A LYTELL TREATYSE, NAMED THE BOWGE OF COURTE.[232]


THE PROLOGUE TO THE BOWGE OF COURTE.

  In autumpne, whan the sonne _in Virgine_
    By radyante hete enryped hath our corne;
  Whan Luna, full of mutabylyte,
    As emperes the dyademe hath worne
    Of our pole artyke, smylynge halfe in scorne
  At our foly and our vnstedfastnesse;
  The tyme whan Mars to werre hym dyde dres;

  I, callynge to mynde the greate auctoryte
    Of poetes olde, whyche full craftely,
  Vnder as couerte termes as coude be,                                  10
    Can touche a trouth[233] and cloke it[234] subtylly
    Wyth fresshe vtteraunce full sentencyously;
  Dyuerse in style, some spared not vyce to wryte,[235]
  Some of moralyte[236] nobly dyde endyte;

  Wherby I rede theyr renome and theyr fame
    Maye neuer dye, bute euermore endure:
  I was sore moued to aforce the same,
    But Ignoraunce full soone dyde me dyscure,[237]
    And shewed that in this arte I[238] was not sure;
  For to illumyne, she sayde, I was to dulle,                           20
  Auysynge[239] me my penne awaye to pulle,

  And not to wryte;[240] for he so wyll atteyne
    Excedynge ferther than his connynge is,
  His hede maye be harde, but feble is his[241] brayne,
    Yet haue I knowen suche er this;
    But of reproche surely he maye not mys,
  That clymmeth hyer than he may fotynge haue;
  What and he slyde downe, who shall hym saue?

  Thus vp and down my mynde was drawen and cast,
    That I ne wyste what to do was[242] beste;                          30
  So sore enwered, that I was at the laste
    Enforsed to slepe and for to take some reste:
    And to lye downe as soone as I me[243] dreste,
  At Harwyche Porte slumbrynge as I laye,
  In myne hostes house, called Powers Keye,

  Methoughte I sawe a shyppe, goodly of sayle,
    Come saylynge forth into that hauen brood,
  Her takelynge ryche and of hye apparayle:
    She kyste[244] an anker, and there she laye at rode.
    Marchauntes her borded to see what she had lode:[245]               40
  Therein they founde royall marchaundyse,
  Fraghted with plesure of what ye coude deuyse.

  But than I thoughte I wolde not dwell behynde;
    Amonge all other I put myselfe in prece.
  Than there coude I none aquentaunce fynde:
    There was moche noyse; anone one cryed, Cese!
    Sharpely commaundynge eche man holde hys pece:
  Maysters, he sayde, the shyp that ye here see,
  The Bowge of Courte it hyghte for certeynte:[246]

  The owner[247] therof is lady of estate,                              50
    Whoos name to tell is dame Saunce-pere;
  Her[248] marchaundyse is ryche and fortunate,
    But who wyll haue it muste paye therfore dere;
    This royall chaffre that is shypped here
  Is called Fauore, to stonde in her good grace.
  Than sholde ye see there pressynge in a pace

  Of one and other that wolde this lady see;
    Whiche sat behynde a traues[249] of sylke fyne,
  Of golde of tessew the fynest that myghte be,
    In a trone whiche fer clerer[250] dyde shyne                        60
    Than Phebus in his spere celestyne;
  Whoos beaute, honoure, goodly porte,
  I haue to lytyll connynge to reporte.

  But, of eche thynge there as I toke hede,
    Amonge all other was wrytten in her trone,
  In golde letters, this worde, whiche I dyde rede,
    _Garder[251] le fortune, que est mauelz et bone!_
    And, as I stode redynge this verse myselfe allone,
  Her chyef gentylwoman, Daunger by her name,
  Gaue me a taunte, and sayde I was to blame                            70

  To be so perte to prese so proudly vppe:
    She sayde she trowed that I had[252] eten sause;
  She asked yf euer I dranke of saucys cuppe.
    And I than softly answered to that clause,
    That, so to saye, I had gyuen her no cause.
  Than asked she me, Syr, so God thé spede,
  What is thy name? and I sayde, it was Drede.

  What mouyd thé, quod she, hydder to come?
    Forsoth, quod I, to bye some of youre ware.
  And with that worde on me she gaue a glome                            80
    With browes bente, and gan on me to stare
    Full daynnously, and fro me she dyde fare,
  Leuynge me stondynge as a mased man:
  To whome there came an other gentylwoman;

  Desyre her name was, and so she me tolde,
    Sayenge to me, Broder,[253] be of good chere,
  Abasshe you not, but hardely be bolde,
    Auaunce yourselfe to aproche and come nere:
    What though our chaffer be neuer so dere,
  Yet I auyse you to speke, for ony drede:                              90
  Who spareth to speke, in fayth he spareth to spede.[254]

  Maystres, quod I, I haue none aquentaunce,
    That wyll for me be medyatoure and mene;
  And[255] this an other, I haue but smale substaunce.
    Pece, quod Desyre, ye speke not worth a bene:
    Yf ye haue not, in fayth I wyll you lene
  A precyous jewell, no rycher in this londe;
  Bone Auenture haue here now in your honde.

  Shyfte now therwith, let see, as ye can,
    In Bowge of Courte cheuysaunce to make;                            100
  For I dare saye that there nys erthly man
    But, an[256] he can Bone Auenture take,
    There can no fauour nor frendshyp hym forsake;
  Bone Auenture may brynge you in suche case
  That ye shall stonde in fauoure and in grace.

  But of one thynge I werne[257] you er[258] I goo,
    She that styreth the shyp, make her your frende.
  Maystres, quod I, I praye you tell me why soo,
    And how I maye that waye and meanes fynde.
    Forsothe, quod she, how euer blowe the wynde,                      110
  Fortune gydeth and ruleth all oure shyppe:
  Whome she hateth shall ouer the see boorde[259] skyp;

  Whome she loueth, of all plesyre[260] is ryche,
    Whyles she laugheth[261] and hath luste for to playe;
  Whome she hateth,[262] she casteth in the dyche,
    For whan she frouneth,[263] she thynketh to make a fray;
    She cheryssheth[264] him, and hym she casseth[265] awaye.
  Alas, quod I, how myghte I haue her sure?
  In fayth, quod she, by Bone Auenture.

  Thus, in a rowe, of martchauntes a grete route                       120
    Suwed to Fortune that she wold be theyre frynde:
  They thronge in fast, and flocked her aboute;
    And I with them prayed her to haue in mynde.
    She promysed to vs all she wolde be kynde:
  Of Bowge of Court she asketh what we wold haue;
  And we asked Fauoure, and Fauour she vs gaue.

_Thus endeth the Prologue; and begynneth the Bowge of Courte breuely
compyled._[266]

DREDE.

  The sayle is vp, Fortune ruleth our helme,
    We wante no wynde to passe now ouer all;
  Fauoure we haue tougher[267] than ony[268] elme,
    That wyll abyde and neuer from vs fall:                            130
    But vnder hony ofte tyme lyeth bytter gall;
  For, as me thoughte, in our shyppe I dyde see
  Full subtyll persones, in nombre foure and thre.

  The fyrste was Fauell, full of flatery,
    Wyth fables false that well coude fayne a tale;
  The seconde was Suspecte, whiche that dayly
    Mysdempte eche man, with face deedly and pale;
    And Haruy Hafter,[269] that well coude picke a male;
  With other foure of theyr affynyte,
  Dysdayne, Ryotte, Dyssymuler, Subtylte.                              140

  Fortune theyr frende, with whome oft she dyde daunce;
    They coude not faile, thei thought, they were so sure;
  And oftentymes I wolde myselfe auaunce
    With them to make solace and pleasure;
    But my dysporte they coude not well endure;
  They sayde they hated for to dele with Drede.
  Than Fauell gan wyth fayre speche me to fede.

FAUELL.

  Noo thynge erthely that I wonder so sore
    As of your connynge, that is so excellent;
  Deynte to haue with vs suche one in store,                           150
    So vertuously that hath his dayes spente;
    Fortune to you gyftes of grace hath lente:
  Loo, what it is a man to haue connynge!
  All erthly tresoure it is surmountynge.

  Ye be an apte man, as ony can be founde,
    To dwell with vs, and serue my ladyes grace;
  Ye be to her yea worth a thousande pounde;
    I herde her speke of you within shorte[270] space,
    Whan there were dyuerse that sore dyde you manace;
  And, though I say it, I was myselfe your frende,                     160
  For here be dyuerse to you that be vnkynde.

  But this one thynge ye maye be sure of me;
    For, by that Lorde that bought dere all mankynde,
  I can not flater, I muste be playne to thé;
    And ye nede ought, man, shewe to me your mynde,
    For ye haue me whome faythfull ye shall fynde;
  Whyles I haue ought, by God, thou shalt not lacke,
  And yf nede be, a bolde worde I dare cracke.

  Nay, naye, be sure, whyles I am on your syde,
    Ye maye not fall, truste me, ye maye not fayle;                    170
  Ye stonde[271] in fauoure, and Fortune is your gyde,
    And, as she wyll, so shall our grete shyppe sayle:
    Thyse lewde cok wattes[272] shall neuermore preuayle
  Ageynste you hardely, therfore be not afrayde:
  Farewell tyll soone; but no worde that I sayde.

DREDE.

  Than thanked I hym for his grete gentylnes:
    But, as me thoughte, he ware on hym a cloke,
  That lyned was with doubtfull doublenes;
    Me thoughte, of wordes that he had full a poke;
    His stomak stuffed ofte tymes dyde reboke:                         180
  Suspycyon, me thoughte, mette hym at a brayde,
  And I drewe nere to herke what they two sayde.

  In faythe, quod Suspecte, spake Drede no worde of me?
    Why, what than? wylte thou lete men to speke?
  He sayth, he can not well accorde with thé.
    Twyst,[273] quod Suspecte, goo playe, hym I ne reke.
    By Cryste, quod Fauell, Drede is soleyne freke:
  What lete vs holde him vp, man, for a whyle?
  Ye soo, quod Suspecte, he maye vs bothe begyle.

  And whan he came walkynge soberly,                                   190
    Wyth whom and ha, and with a croked loke,
  Me thoughte, his hede was full of gelousy,
    His eyen rollynge, his hondes faste they quoke;
    And to me warde the strayte waye he toke:
  God spede, broder![274] to me quod he than;
  And thus to talke with me he began.

SUSPYCYON.

  Ye remembre the gentylman ryghte nowe
    That commaunde[275] with you, me thought, a party space?[276]
  Beware of him, for, I make God auowe,
    He wyll begyle you and speke fayre to your face:                   200
    Ye neuer dwelte in suche an other place,
  For here is none that dare well other truste;
  But I wolde telle you a thynge, and I durste.

  Spake he a fayth no worde to you of me?
    I wote, and he dyde, ye wolde me telle.
  I haue a fauoure to you, wherof it be
    That I muste shewe you moche[277] of my counselle:
    But I wonder what the deuyll of helle
  He sayde of me, whan he with you dyde talke:
  By myne auyse[278] vse not with him to walke.                        210

  The soueraynst thynge that ony[279] man maye haue,
    Is lytyll to saye, and moche[280] to here and see;
  For, but I trusted you, so God me saue,
    I wolde noo thynge so playne be;
    To you oonly, me thynke, I durste shryue me
  For now am I plenarely dysposed
  To shewe you thynges that may not be disclosed.

DREDE.

  Than I assured hym my fydelyte,
    His counseyle secrete neuer to dyscure,[281]
  Yf he coude fynde in herte to truste me;                             220
    Els I prayed hym, with all my besy cure,
    To kepe it hymselfe, for than he myghte be sure
  That noo man[282] erthly coude hym bewreye,
  Whyles of his mynde it were lockte with the keye.

  By God, quod he, this and thus it is;
    And of his mynde he shewed me all and some.
  Farewell, quod he, we wyll talke more of this:
    Soo he departed there he wolde be come.
    I dare not speke, I promysed to be dome:
  But, as I stode musynge in my mynde,                                 230
  Haruy Hafter[283] came lepynge, lyghte as lynde.

  Vpon his breste he bare a versynge boxe;
    His throte was clere, and lustely coude fayne;
  Me[284] thoughte, his gowne was all furred wyth foxe;
    And euer he sange, Sythe I am no thynge playne.
    To kepe him frome pykynge it was a grete payne:
  He gased on me with his gotyshe berde;
  Whan I loked on hym, my[285] purse was half aferde.

HARUY HAFTER.[286]

  Syr, God you saue! why loke ye so sadde?
    What thynge is that I maye do for you?                             240
  A wonder thynge that ye waxe not madde!
    For, and I studye sholde as ye doo nowe,
    My wytte wolde waste, I make God auowe.
  Tell me your mynde: me thynke, ye make a verse;
  I coude it skan,[287] and ye wolde it[288] reherse.

  But to the poynte shortely to procede,
    Where hathe your dwellynge ben, er ye cam here?
  For, as I trowe, I haue sene you indede
    Er this, whan that ye made me royall chere.
    Holde vp the helme, loke vp, and lete God stere:                   250
  I wolde be mery, what wynde that euer blowe,
  Heue and how rombelow, row the bote, Norman, rowe!

  Prynces of yougthe[289] can ye synge by rote?
    Or shall I sayle wyth you a felashyp assaye;
  For on the booke I[290] can not synge a note.
    Wolde to God, it wolde please you some daye
    A balade boke before me for to laye,
  And lerne me to synge, Re, my, fa, sol!
  And, whan I fayle, bobbe me on the noll.

  Loo, what is to you a pleasure grete,                                260
    To haue that connynge and wayes that ye haue!
  By Goddis soule, I wonder how ye gete
    Soo greate pleasyre,[291] or who to you it gaue:
    Syr, pardone me, I am an homely knaue,
  To be with you thus perte and thus bolde;
  But ye be welcome to our housholde.

  And, I dare saye, there is no man here inne
    But wolde be glad of your company:
  I wyste neuer man that so soone coude wynne
    The fauoure that ye haue with my lady;                             270
    I praye to God that it maye neuer dy:
  It is your fortune for to haue that grace;
  As I be saued, it is a wonder case.

  For, as for me, I serued here many a daye,
    And yet vnneth I can haue my lyuynge:
  But I requyre you no worde that I saye;
    For, and I knowe ony erthly thynge
    That is agayne you, ye shall haue wetynge:
  And ye be welcome, syr, so God me saue:
  I hope here after a frende of you to haue.                           280

DREDE.

  Wyth that, as he departed soo fro me,
    Anone ther mette with him, as me thoughte,
  A man, but wonderly besene was he;
    He loked hawte,[292] he sette eche man at noughte;
    His gawdy garment with scornnys[293] was all wrought;
  With indygnacyon lyned was his hode;
  He frowned, as he wolde swere by Cockes blode;

  He bote the[294] lyppe, he loked passynge coye;
    His face was belymmed, as byes had him stounge:
  It was no tyme with him to jape nor toye;                            290
    Enuye hathe wasted his lyuer and his lounge,
    Hatred by the herte so had hym wrounge,
  That he loked pale as asshes to my syghte:
  Dysdayne, I wene, this comerous crabes hyghte.[295]

  To Heruy Hafter[296] than he spake of me,
    And I drewe nere to harke what they two sayde.
  Now, quod Dysdayne, as I shall saued be,
    I haue grete scorne, and am ryghte euyll apayed.
    Than quod Heruy, why arte thou so dysmayde?
  By Cryste, quod he, for it is shame to saye;                         300
  To see Johan Dawes, that came but yester daye,

  How he is now taken in conceyte,
    This doctour Dawcocke, Drede, I wene, he hyghte:
  By Goddis bones, but yf we haue som sleyte,
    It is lyke he wyll stonde in our[297] lyghte.
    By God, quod Heruy, and it so happen myghte;
  Lete vs therfore shortely at a worde
  Fynde some mene to caste him ouer the borde.

  By Him that me boughte, than quod Dysdayne,
    I wonder sore he is in suche conceyte.                             310
  Turde, quod Hafter,[298] I wyll thé no thynge layne,[299]
    There muste for hym be layde some prety beyte;
    We tweyne, I trowe, be not withoute dysceyte:
  Fyrste pycke a quarell, and fall oute with hym then,
  And soo outface hym with a carde of ten.

  Forthwith he made on me a prowde assawte,
    With scornfull[300] loke meuyd all in moode;
  He wente aboute to take me in a fawte;
    He frounde, he stared, he stampped where he stoode.
    I lokyd on hym, I wende he had be woode.                           320
  He set the arme proudly vnder the syde,
  And in this wyse he gan with me to chyde.

DISDAYNE.

  Remembrest thou what thou sayd yester nyght?
    Wylt thou abyde by the wordes agayne?
  By God, I haue of thé now grete dyspyte;
    I shall thé angre ones in euery vayne:
    It is greate scorne to see suche an hayne
  As thou arte, one that cam but yesterdaye,
  With vs olde seruauntes suche maysters to playe.

  I tell thé, I am of countenaunce:                                    330
    What weneste I were? I trowe, thou knowe not me.
  By Goddis woundes, but for dysplesaunce,
    Of my querell soone wolde I venged be:
    But no force, I shall ones mete with thé;
  Come whan it wyll, oppose thé I shall,
  What someuer auenture therof fall.

  Trowest thou, dreuyll, I saye, thou gawdy knaue,
    That I haue deynte to see thé cherysshed thus?
  By Goddis syde, my sworde thy berde shall shaue;
    Well, ones thou shalte be chermed, I wus:                          340
    Naye, strawe for tales, thou shalte not rule vs;
  We be thy betters, and so thou shalte vs take,
  Or we shall thé oute of thy clothes shake.

DREDE.

  Wyth that came Ryotte, russhynge all at ones,
    A rusty gallande, to-ragged and to-rente;
  And on the borde he whyrled a payre of bones,
    _Quater treye dews_ he clatered as he wente;
    Now haue at all, by saynte Thomas of Kente!
  And euer he threwe and kyst[301] I wote nere what:
  His here was growen thorowe oute his hat.                            350

  Thenne I behelde how he dysgysed was:
    His hede was heuy for watchynge ouer nyghte,
  His eyen blereed, his face shone lyke a glas;
    His gowne so shorte that it ne couer myghte
    His rumpe, he wente so all for somer lyghte;
  His hose was garded wyth a lyste of grene,
  Yet at the knee they were broken, I wene.

  His cote was checked[302] with patches rede and blewe;
    Of Kyrkeby Kendall was his shorte demye;
  And ay he sange, In fayth, decon thou crewe;                         360
    His elbowe bare, he ware his gere so nye;
    His nose a[303] droppynge, his lyppes were full drye;
  And by his syde his whynarde and his pouche,
  The deuyll myghte daunce therin for ony[304] crowche.

  Counter he coude _O lux_ vpon a potte;
    An[305] eestryche fedder of a capons tayle
  He set vp fresshely vpon his hat alofte:
    What reuell route! quod he, and gan to rayle
    How ofte he hadde[306] hit Jenet on the tayle,
  Of Felyce fetewse, and lytell prety Cate,                            370
  How ofte he knocked at her klycked gate.

  What sholde I tell more of his rebaudrye?
    I was ashamed so to here hym prate:
  He had no pleasure but in harlotrye.
    Ay, quod he, in the deuylles date,
    What arte thou? I sawe thé nowe but late.
  Forsothe, quod I, in this courte I dwell nowe.
  Welcome, quod Ryote, I make God auowe.[307]

RYOTE.

  And, syr, in fayth why comste not vs amonge,
    To make thé mery, as other felowes done?                           380
  Thou muste swere and stare, man, al daye longe,
    And wake all nyghte, and slepe tyll it be none;
    Thou mayste not studye, or muse on the mone;
  This worlde is nothynge but ete, drynke, and slepe,
  And thus with vs good company to kepe.

  Plucke vp thyne herte vpon a mery pyne,
    And lete vs laugh a placke[308] or tweyne at nale:
  What the deuyll, man, myrthe was neuer one![309]
    What, loo, man, see here of dyce a bale!
    A brydelynge caste for that is in thy male!                        390
  Now haue at all that lyeth vpon the burde!
  Fye on this dyce, they be not worth a turde!

  Haue at the hasarde, or at the dosen browne,
    Or els I[310] pas a peny to a pounde!
  Now, wolde to God, thou wolde leye money downe!
    Lorde, how that I wolde caste it full rounde!
    Ay, in my pouche a buckell I haue founde;
  The armes of Calyce, I haue no coyne nor crosse!
  I am not happy, I renne ay on the losse.

  Now renne muste I to the stewys syde,                                400
    To wete yf Malkyn, my lemman, haue gete oughte:
  I lete her to hyre, that men maye on her ryde,
    Her armes[311] easy ferre and nere is soughte:
    By Goddis sydes; syns I her thyder broughte,
  She hath gote me more money with her tayle
  Than hath some shyppe that into Bordews sayle.

  Had I as good an hors as she is a mare,
    I durst auenture to iourney thorugh[312] Fraunce;
  Who rydeth on her, he nedeth not to care,
    For she is trussed for to breke a launce;                          410
    It is a curtel[313] that well can wynche and praunce:
  To her wyll I nowe all my pouerte lege;
  And, tyll I come, haue here is[314] myne hat to plege.

DREDE.

  Gone is this knaue, this rybaude foule and leude;
    He ran as fast as euer that he myghte:
  Vnthryftynes[315] in hym may well be shewed,
    For whome[316] Tyborne groneth both daye and nyghte.
    And, as I stode and kyste[317] asyde my syghte,
  Dysdayne I sawe with Dyssymulacyon
  Standynge in sadde communicacion.                                    420

  But there was poyntynge and noddynge with the hede,
    And many wordes sayde in secrete wyse;
  They wandred ay, and stode styll in no stede:
    Me thoughte, alwaye Dyscymular dyde deuyse;
    Me passynge sore myne herte than gan agryse,[318]
  I dempte and drede theyr talkynge was not good.
  Anone Dyscymular came where I stode.

  Than in his hode I sawe there faces tweyne;
    That one was lene and lyke a pyned goost,
  That other loked as he wolde me haue[319] slayne;                    430
    And to me warde as he gan for to coost,
    Whan that he was euen at me almoost,
  I sawe a knyfe hyd in his one sleue,
  Wheron was wryten this worde, _Myscheue_.

  And in his other sleue, me thought, I sawe
    A spone of golde, full of hony swete,
  To fede a fole, and for to preue a dawe;[320]
    And on that sleue these wordes were wrete,
    _A false abstracte cometh from a fals concrete_:
  His hode was syde, his cope was roset graye:                         440
  Thyse were the wordes that[321] he to me dyde saye.

DYSSYMULATION.

  How do ye, mayster? ye loke so soberly:
    As I be saued at the dredefull daye,
  It is a perylous vyce, this enuy:
    Alas, a connynge man ne dwelle maye
    In no place well, but foles with hym[322] fraye!
  But as for that, connynge hath no foo
  Saue hym that nought can, Scrypture sayth soo.

  I knowe your vertu and your lytterature[323]
    By that lytel connynge that I haue:                                450
  Ye be malygned sore, I you ensure;
    But ye haue crafte your selfe alwaye to saue:
    It is grete scorne to se a mysproude knaue
  With a clerke that connynge is to prate:
  Lete theym go lowse theym, in the deuylles date!

  For all be it that this longe not to me,
    Yet on my backe I bere suche lewde delynge:
  Ryghte now I spake with one, I trowe, I see;
    But, what, a strawe! I maye not tell all thynge.
    By God, I saye there is grete herte brennynge                      460
  Betwene the persone ye wote of, you;[324]
  Alas, I coude not dele so with a Jew![325]

  I wolde eche man were as playne as I;
    It is a worlde, I saye, to[326] here of some:
  I hate this faynynge, fye vpon it, fye!
    A man can not wote where to be come:
    I wys I coude tell,[327]—but humlery, home;
  I dare not speke, we be so layde awayte,
  For all our courte is full of dysceyte.

  Now, by saynte Fraunceys, that holy man and frere,                   470
    I hate these[328] wayes agayne you that they take:
  Were I as you, I wolde ryde them full nere;
    And, by my trouthe, but yf an ende they make,
    Yet wyll I saye some wordes for your sake,
  That shall them angre, I holde thereon a grote;
  For some shall wene be hanged by the throte.

  I haue a stoppynge oyster in my poke,
    Truste me, and yf it come to a nede:
  But I am lothe for to reyse a smoke,
    Yf ye coude be otherwyse agrede;                                   480
    And so I wolde it were, so God me spede,
  For this maye brede to a confusyon,
  Withoute God make a good conclusyon.

  Naye, see where yonder stondeth the teder man!
    A flaterynge knaue and false he is, God wote;
  The dreuyll stondeth to herken, and he can:
    It were more thryft, he boughte him a newe cote;
    It will not be, his purse is not on flote:
  All that he wereth, it is borowed ware;
  His wytte is thynne, his hode is threde bare.                        490

  More coude I saye, but what this is ynowe:
    Adewe tyll soone, we shall speke more of this:
  Ye muste be ruled as I shall tell you howe;
    Amendis maye be of that is now amys;
    And I am your, syr, so haue I blys,
  In[329] euery poynte that I can do or saye:
  Gyue me your honde, farewell, and haue good daye.

DREDE.

  Sodaynly, as he departed me fro,
    Came pressynge in one in a wonder araye:
  Er I was ware, behynde me he sayde, Bo!                              500
    Thenne I, astonyed of that sodeyne fraye,
    Sterte all at ones, I lyked no thynge his playe;
  For, yf I had not quyckely fledde the touche,
  He had plucte oute the nobles of my pouche.

  He was trussed in a garmente strayte:
    I haue not sene suche an others page;
  For he coude well vpon a casket wayte;
    His hode[330] all pounsed and garded lyke a cage;
    Lyghte lyme fynger, he toke none other wage.
  Harken, quod he, loo here myne honde in thyne;                       510
  To vs welcome thou arte, by saynte Quyntyne.

DISCEYTE.

  But, by that Lorde that is one, two, and thre,
    I haue an errande to rounde in your ere:
  He tolde me so, by God, ye maye truste me,
    Parte[331] remembre whan ye were there,
    There I wynked on you,—wote ye not where?
  In A _loco_, I mene _juxta_ B:
  Woo is hym that is blynde and maye not see!

  But to here the subtylte and the crafte,
    As I shall tell you, yf ye wyll harke agayne;                      520
  And, whan I sawe the horsons wolde you hafte,
  To holde myne honde, by God, I had grete payne;
    For forthwyth there I had him slayne,
  But that I drede[332] mordre wolde come oute:
  Who deleth with shrewes hath nede to loke aboute.

DREDE.

  And as he rounded[333] thus in myne ere
    Of false collusyon confetryd by assente,
  Me thoughte, I see lewde felawes here and there
    Came for to slee me of mortall entente;
    And, as they came, the shypborde faste I hente,                    530
  And thoughte to lepe; and euen with that woke,
  Caughte penne and ynke, and wrote[334] this lytyll boke.

  I wolde therwith no man were myscontente;
    Besechynge you that shall it see or rede,
  In euery poynte to be indyfferente,
    Syth all in substaunce of slumbrynge doth procede:
    I wyll not saye it is mater in dede,
  But yet oftyme suche dremes be founde trewe:
  Now constrewe ye what is the resydewe.

HERE AFTER[335] FOLOWETH THE BOKE OF PHYLLYP SPAROWE, COMPYLED BY MAYSTER
SKELTON, POETE LAUREATE.


  _Pla ce bo_,
  Who is there, who?
  _Di le xi_,
  Dame Margery;
  Fa, re, my, my,
  Wherfore and why, why?
  For the sowle of Philip Sparowe,
  That was late slayn at Carowe,
  Among the Nones Blake,
  For that swete soules sake,                                           10
  And for all sparowes soules,
  Set in our bederolles,
  _Pater noster qui_,
  With an _Ave Mari_,
  And with the corner of a Crede,
  The more shalbe your mede.
    Whan I remembre agayn
  How mi Philyp was slayn,
  Neuer halfe the payne
  Was betwene you twayne,                                               20
  Pyramus and Thesbe,
  As than befell to me:
  I wept and I wayled,
  The tearys downe hayled;
  But nothynge it auayled
  To call Phylyp agayne,
  Whom Gyb our cat hath slayne.
    Gib, I saye, our cat
  Worrowyd her on that
  Which I loued best:                                                   30
  It can not be exprest
  My sorowfull heuynesse,
  But all without redresse;
  For within that stounde,
  Halfe slumbrynge, in a sounde
  I fell downe to the grounde.
    Vnneth I kest myne eyes
  Towarde the cloudy skyes:
  But whan I dyd beholde
  My sparow dead and colde,                                             40
  No creatuer but that wolde
  Haue rewed vpon me,
  To behold and se
  What heuynesse dyd me pange;
  Wherewith my handes I wrange,
  That my senaws cracked,
  As though I had ben racked,
  So payned and so strayned,
  That no lyfe wellnye remayned.
    I syghed and I sobbed,                                              50
  For that I was robbed
  Of my sparowes lyfe.
  O mayden, wydow, and wyfe,
  Of what estate ye be,
  Of hye or lowe degre,
  Great sorowe than ye myght se,
  And lerne to wepe at me!
  Such paynes dyd me frete,
  That myne hert dyd bete,
  My vysage pale and dead,                                              60
  Wanne, and blewe as lead;
  The panges of hatefull death
  Wellnye had[336] stopped my breath.
    _Heu, heu, me_,
  That I am wo for thé!
  _Ad Dominum, cum tribularer, clamavi_:
  Of God nothynge els craue I
  But Phyllypes soule to kepe
  From the marees deepe
  Of Acherontes well,                                                   70
  That is a flode of hell;
  And from the great Pluto,
  The prynce of endles wo;
  And from foule Alecto,
  With vysage blacke and blo;
  And from Medusa, that mare,
  That lyke a fende doth stare;
  And from Megeras edders,
  For[337] rufflynge of Phillips fethers,
  And from her fyry sparklynges,                                        80
  For burnynge of his wynges;
  And from the smokes sowre
  Of Proserpinas bowre;
  And from the dennes darke,
  Wher Cerberus doth barke,
  Whom Theseus dyd afraye,
  Whom Hercules dyd outraye,
  As famous poetes say;
  From[338] that hell hounde,
  That lyeth in cheynes bounde,                                         90
  With gastly hedes thre,
  To Jupyter pray we
  That Phyllyp preserued may be!
  Amen, say ye with me!
    _Do mi nus_,
  Helpe nowe, swete Jesus!
  _Levavi oculos meos in montes_:[339]
  Wolde God I had Zenophontes,[340]
  Or Socrates the wyse,
  To shew me their deuyse,                                             100
  Moderatly to take
  This sorow that I make
  For Phyllip Sparowes sake!
  So feruently I shake,
  I fele my body quake;
  So vrgently I am brought
  Into carefull thought.
  Like Andromach,[341] Hectors wyfe,
  Was wery of her lyfe,
  Whan she had lost her ioye,                                          110
  Noble Hector of Troye;
  In lyke maner also
  Encreaseth my dedly wo,
  For my sparowe is go.
    It was so prety a fole,
  It wold syt[342] on a stole,
  And lerned after my scole
  For to kepe his cut,
  With, Phyllyp, kepe your cut!
    It had a veluet cap,                                               120
  And wold syt vpon my lap,
  And seke after small wormes,
  And somtyme white bred crommes;
  And many tymes and ofte
  Betwene my brestes softe
  It wolde lye and rest;
  It was propre and prest.
    Somtyme he wolde gaspe
  Whan he sawe a waspe;
  A fly or a gnat,                                                     130
  He wolde flye at that;
  And prytely he wold pant
  Whan he saw an ant;
  Lord, how he wolde pry
  After the butterfly!
  Lorde, how he wolde hop
  After the gressop!
  And whan I sayd, Phyp, Phyp,
  Than he wold lepe and skyp,
  And take me by the lyp.                                              140
  Alas, it wyll me slo,
  That Phillyp is gone me fro!
    _Si in i qui ta tes_,
  Alas, I was euyll at ease!
  _De pro fun dis cla ma vi_,
  Whan I sawe my sparowe dye!
    Nowe, after my dome,
  Dame Sulpicia[343] at Rome,
  Whose name regystred was
  For euer in tables of bras,                                          150
  Because that[344] she dyd pas
  In poesy to endyte,
  And eloquently[345] to wryte,
  Though she wolde pretende
  My sparowe to commende,
  I trowe she coude not amende
  Reportynge the vertues all
  Of my sparowe royall.
    For it wold come and go,
  And fly[346] so to and fro;                                          160
  And on me it wolde lepe
  Whan I was aslepe,
  And his fethers[347] shake,
  Wherewith he wolde make
  Me often for to wake,
  And for to take him in
  Vpon my naked skyn;
  God wot, we thought no syn:
  What though[348] he crept so lowe?
  It was no hurt, I trowe,                                             170
  He dyd nothynge perde
  But syt vpon my kne:
  Phyllyp, though he were nyse,
  In him it was no vyse;
  Phyllyp had leue to go
  To pyke my lytell too;
  Phillip myght be bolde
  And do what he wolde;
  Phillip wolde seke and take
  All the flees blake                                                  180
  That he coulde there espye
  With his wanton eye.
    _O pe ra_,
  La, soll, fa, fa,
  _Confitebor tibi, Domine, in[349] toto corde meo_.
  Alas, I wold ryde and go
  A thousand myle of grounde!
  If any such might be found,
  It were worth an hundreth pound
  Of kynge Cresus golde,                                               190
  Or of Attalus[350] the olde,
  The ryche prynce of Pargame,
  Who so lyst the story to se.
  Cadmus, that his syster sought,
  And he shold be bought
  For golde and fee,
  He shuld ouer the see,
  To wete if he coulde brynge
  Any of the ofsprynge,[351]
  Or any of the blode.                                                 200
  But whoso vnderstode
  Of Medeas arte,
  I wolde I had a parte
  Of her crafty magyke!
  My sparowe than shuld be quycke
  With a charme or twayne,
  And playe with me agayne.
  But all this is in vayne
  Thus for to complayne.
    I toke my sampler ones,                                            210
  Of purpose, for the nones,
  To sowe with stytchis of sylke
  My sparow whyte as mylke,
  That by representacyon
  Of his image and facyon,
  To me it myght importe
  Some pleasure and comforte
  For my solas and sporte:
  But whan I was sowing his beke,
  Methought, my sparow did speke,                                      220
  And opened[352] his prety byll,
  Saynge, Mayd, ye are in wyll
  Agayne me for to kyll,
  Ye prycke me in the head!
  With that my nedle waxed[353] red,
  Methought, of Phyllyps blode;
  Myne hear ryght vpstode,
  And was in suche a fray,
  My speche was taken away.
  I kest downe that there was,                                         230
  And sayd, Alas, alas,
  How commeth this to pas?
  My fyngers, dead and colde,
  Coude not my sampler holde;
  My nedle and threde
  I threwe away for drede.
  The best now that I maye,
  Is for his soule to pray:
  _A porta inferi_,
  Good Lorde, haue mercy                                               240
  Vpon my sparowes soule,
  Wryten in my bederoule!
    _Au di vi vo cem_,
  Japhet, Cam, and Sem,
  _Ma gni fi cat_,
  Shewe me the ryght path
  To the hylles of Armony,
  Wherfore the birdes[354] yet cry
  Of your fathers bote,
  That was sometyme aflote,                                            250
  And nowe they lye and rote;
  Let some poetes wryte
  Deucalyons flode it hyght:
  But as verely as ye be
  The naturall sonnes thre
  Of Noe the patryarke,
  That made that great arke,
  Wherin he had apes and owles,
  Beestes, byrdes, and foules,
  That if ye can fynde                                                 260
  Any of my sparowes kynde,
  God sende the soule good rest!
  I wolde haue yet[355] a nest
  As prety and as prest
  As my sparowe was.
  But my sparowe dyd pas
  All sparowes of the wode
  That were syns Noes flode,
  Was neuer none so good;
  Kynge Phylyp of Macedony                                             270
  Had no such Phylyp as I,
  No, no, syr, hardely.
    That vengeaunce I aske and crye,
  By way of exclamacyon,
  On all the hole nacyon
  Of cattes wylde and tame;
  God send them sorowe and shame!
  That cat specyally
  That slew so cruelly
  My lytell prety sparowe                                              280
  That I brought vp at Carowe.
    O cat of carlyshe[356] kynde,
  The fynde was in thy mynde
  Whan thou my byrde vntwynde!
  I wold thou haddest ben blynde!
  The leopardes sauage,
  The lyons in theyr rage,
  Myght catche thé in theyr pawes,
  And gnawe thé in theyr iawes!
  The[357] serpentes[358] of Lybany                                    290
  Myght stynge thé venymously!
  The dragones with their tonges
  Might poyson thy lyuer and longes!
  The mantycors of the montaynes
  Myght fede them on thy braynes!
    Melanchates, that hounde
  That plucked Acteon to the grounde,
  Gaue hym his mortall wounde,
  Chaunged to a dere,
  The story doth appere,                                               300
  Was chaunged to an harte:
  So thou, foule cat that thou arte,
  The selfe same hounde
  Myght thé confounde,
  That his owne lord bote,
  Myght byte asondre thy throte!
    Of Inde the gredy grypes
  Myght tere out all thy trypes!
  Of Arcady the beares
  Might plucke awaye thyne eares!                                      310
  The wylde wolfe Lycaon
  Byte asondre thy backe bone!
  Of Ethna the brennynge hyll,
  That day and night brenneth styl,
  Set in thy tayle a blase,
  That all the world may gase
  And wonder vpon thé,
  From Occyan the greate se
  Vnto the Iles of Orchady,
  From Tyllbery fery                                                   320
  To the playne of Salysbery!
  So trayterously my byrde to kyll
  That neuer ought thé euyll wyll!
    Was neuer byrde in cage
  More gentle of corage
  In doynge his homage
  Vnto his souerayne.
  Alas, I say agayne,
  Deth hath departed vs twayne!
  The false cat hath thé slayne:                                       330
  Farewell, Phyllyp, adew!
  Our Lorde thy soule reskew!
  Farewell without restore,
  Farewell for euermore!
    And it were[359] a Jewe,
  It wolde make one rew,
  To se my sorow new.
  These vylanous false cattes
  Were made for myse and rattes,
  And not for byrdes smale.                                            340
  Alas, my face waxeth pale,
  Tellynge this pyteyus tale,
  How my byrde so fayre,
  That was wont to repayre,
  And go in at my spayre,
  And crepe in at my gore[360]
  Of my gowne before,
  Flyckerynge with his wynges!
  Alas, my hert it stynges,
  Remembrynge prety thynges!                                           350
  Alas, myne hert it sleth
  My Phyllyppes dolefull deth,
  Whan I remembre it,
  How pretely it wolde syt,
  Many tymes and ofte,
  Vpon my fynger aloft!
  I played with him tyttell tattyll,
  And fed him with my spattyl,
  With his byll betwene my lippes;
  It was my prety Phyppes!                                             360
  Many a prety kusse
  Had I of his[361] swete musse;
  And now the cause is thus,
  That he is slayne me fro,
  To my great payne and wo.
    Of fortune this the chaunce
  Standeth on[362] varyaunce:
  Oft tyme after pleasaunce
  Trouble and greuaunce;
  No man can be sure                                                   370
  Allway to haue pleasure:
  As well perceyue ye maye
  How my dysport and play
  From me was taken away
  By Gyb, our cat sauage,
  That in a[363] furyous rage
  Caught Phyllyp by the head,
  And slew him there starke dead.
    _Kyrie, eleison,_
    _Christe, eleison,_                                                380
    _Kyrie, eleison!_
  For Phylyp Sparowes soule,
  Set in our bederolle,
  Let vs now whysper
  A _Pater noster_.
    _Lauda, anima mea, Dominum!_
  To wepe with me loke that ye come,
  All maner of byrdes in your kynd;
  Se none be left behynde.
  To mornynge loke that ye fall                                        390
  With dolorous songes funerall,
  Some to synge, and some to say,
  Some to wepe, and some to pray,
  Euery byrde in his laye.
  The goldfynche, the wagtayle;
  The ianglynge iay to rayle,
  The fleckyd pye to chatter
  Of this dolorous mater;
  And robyn redbrest,
  He shall be the preest                                               400
  The requiem masse to synge,
  Softly[364] warbelynge,
  With helpe of the red sparow,
  And the chattrynge swallow,
  This herse for to halow;
  The larke with his longe to;
  The spynke, and the martynet also;
  The shouelar with his brode bek;
  The doterell, that folyshe pek,
  And also the mad coote,                                              410
  With a balde face to toote;
  The feldefare, and the snyte;
  The crowe, and the kyte;
  The rauyn, called Rolfe,
  His playne songe to solfe;
  The partryche, the quayle;
  The plouer with vs to wayle;
  The woodhacke, that syngeth chur
  Horsly, as he had the mur;
  The lusty chauntyng nyghtyngale;                                     420
  The popyngay to tell her tale,
  That toteth oft in a glasse,
  Shal rede the Gospell at masse;
  The mauys with her whystell
  Shal rede there the pystell.
  But with a large and a longe
  To kepe iust playne songe,
  Our chaunters shalbe the cuckoue,
  The culuer, the stockedowue,
  With puwyt the lapwyng,                                              430
  The versycles shall syng.
    The bitter[365] with his bumpe,
  The crane with his trumpe,
  The swan of Menander,[366]
  The gose and the gander,
  The ducke and the[367] drake,
  Shall watche at this wake;
  The pecocke so prowde,
  Bycause his voyce is lowde,
  And hath a glorious tayle,                                           440
  He shall syng the grayle;
  The owle, that is[368] so foule,
  Must helpe vs to houle;
  The heron so gaunce,[369]
  And the cormoraunce,[370]
  With the fesaunte,
  And the gaglynge gaunte,
  And the churlysshe chowgh;
  The route and the kowgh;[371]
  The barnacle, the bussarde,                                          450
  With the wilde[372] mallarde;

  The water hen[373] to wepe;
  The puffin[374] and the tele
  Money they shall dele
  To poore folke at large,
  That shall be theyr charge;
  The semewe and the tytmose;
  The wodcocke with the longe nose;
  The threstyl with her warblyng;                                      460
  The starlyng with her brablyng;
  The roke, with the ospraye
  That putteth fysshes to a fraye;
  And the denty curlewe,
  With the turtyll most trew.
    At this _Placebo_
  We may not well forgo
  The countrynge of the coe:
  The storke also,
  That maketh his nest                                                 470
  In chymneyes to rest;
  Within those walles
  No[375] broken galles
  May there abyde
  Of cokoldry syde,
  Or els phylosophy
  Maketh a great lye.
    The estryge, that wyll eate
  An horshowe so great,
  In the stede of meate,                                               480
  Such feruent heat
  His stomake doth freat;[376]
  He can not well fly,
  Nor synge tunably,
  Yet at a brayde

  To solfe aboue ela,

  The best that we can,
  To make hym our belman,
  And let hym ryng the bellys;
  He can do nothyng ellys.
    Chaunteclere, our coke,
  Must tell what is of the clocke
  By the astrology
  That he hath naturally
  Conceyued and cought,[378]
  And was neuer tought[379]                                            500
  By Albumazer
  The astronomer,
  Nor by Ptholomy
  Prince of astronomy,
  Nor yet by Haly;
  And yet he croweth dayly
  And nightly[380] the tydes
  That no man abydes,
  With Partlot his hen,
  Whom now and then                                                    510
  Hee plucketh by the hede
  Whan he doth her trede.
    The byrde of Araby,
  That potencyally
  May neuer dye,
  And yet there is none
  But one alone;
  A phenex it is
  This herse that must blys
  With armatycke gummes                                                520
  That cost great summes,[381]
  The way of thurifycation
  To make a[382] fumigation,
  Swete of reflary,[383]
  And redolent of eyre,[384]
  This corse for to[385] sence
  With greate reuerence,
  As patryarke or pope
  In a blacke cope;
  Whyles[386] he senseth [the herse],                                  530
  He shall synge the verse,
  _Libera me_,
  In de, la, soll, re,
  Softly bemole
  For my sparowes soule.
  Plinni sheweth all
  In his story naturall
  What he doth fynde
  Of the phenyx kynde;
  Of whose incyneracyon                                                540
  There ryseth a new creacyon
  Of the same facyon
  Without alteracyon,
  Sauyng that olde age
  Is turned into corage
  Of fresshe youth agayne;
  This matter trew and playne,
  Playne matter indede,
  Who so lyst to rede.
    But for the egle doth flye                                         550
  Hyest in the skye,
  He shall be the[387] sedeane,
  The quere to demeane,
  As prouost pryncypall,
  To teach them theyr ordynall;
  Also the noble fawcon,
  With the gerfawcon,[388]
  The tarsell gentyll,
  They shall morne soft and styll
  In theyr amysse of gray;                                             560
  The sacre with them shall say
  _Dirige_ for Phyllyppes soule;
  The goshauke shall haue a role
  The queresters to controll;
  The lanners and the[389] marlyons
  Shall stand in their morning gounes;
  The hobby and the muskette
  The sensers and the crosse shall fet;
  The kestrell in all this warke
  Shall be holy water[390] clarke.                                     570
    And now the darke cloudy nyght
  Chaseth away Phebus bryght,
  Taking his course toward the west,
  God sende my sparoes sole good rest!
  _Requiem æternam dona eis,[391] Domine_!
  Fa, fa, fa, my, re, re,[392]
  _A por ta in fe ri_,
  Fa, fa, fa, my, my.
    _Credo videre bona Domini_,
  I pray God, Phillip to heuen may fly!                                580
  _Domine, exaudi orationem meam!_
  To heuen he shall, from heuen he cam!
    _Do mi nus vo bis cum!_
  Of al good praiers God send him sum!
              _Oremus._
  _Deus, cui proprium est misereri et parcere_,
  On Phillips soule haue pyte!
  For he was a prety cocke,
  And came of a gentyll stocke,
  And wrapt in a maidenes smocke,                                      590
  And cherysshed full dayntely,
  Tyll[393] cruell fate made him to dy:
  Alas, for dolefull desteny![394]
  But whereto shuld I
  Lenger morne or crye?
  To Jupyter I call,
  Of heuen emperyall,
  That Phyllyp may fly
  Aboue the starry sky,
  To treade the prety wren,                                            600
  That is our Ladyes hen:
  Amen, amen, amen!
    Yet one thynge is behynde,
  That now commeth to mynde;[395]
  An epytaphe I wold haue
  For Phyllyppes graue:
  But for I am a mayde,
  Tymerous, halfe afrayde,
  That neuer yet asayde
  Of Elyconys well,                                                    610
  Where the Muses dwell;
  Though I can rede and spell,
  Recounte, reporte, and tell
  Of the Tales of Caunterbury,
  Some sad storyes, some mery;
  As Palamon and Arcet,
  Duke Theseus, and Partelet;
  And of the Wyfe of Bath,
  That[396] worketh moch scath
  Whan her tale is tolde                                               620
  Amonge huswyues bolde,
  How she controlde
  Her husbandes as she wolde,
  And them to despyse
  In the homylyest wyse,
  Brynge other wyues in thought
  Their husbandes to set at nought:
  And though that rede haue I
  Of Gawen and syr Guy,
  And tell can a great pece                                            630
  Of the Golden Flece,
  How Jason it wan,
  Lyke a valyaunt man;
  Of Arturs rounde table,
  With his knightes commendable,
  And dame Gaynour, his quene,
  Was somwhat wanton, I wene;
  How syr Launcelote de Lake
  Many a spere brake
  For his ladyes sake;                                                 640
  Of Trystram, and kynge Marke,
  And al the hole warke
  Of Bele Isold his wyfe,
  For whom was moch stryfe;
  Some say she was lyght,
  And made her husband knyght
  Of the comyne[397] hall,
  That cuckoldes men call;
  And of syr Lybius,
  Named Dysconius;                                                     650
  Of Quater Fylz Amund,[398]
  And how they were sommonde
  To Rome, to Charlemayne,
  Vpon a great payne,
  And how they rode eche one
  On Bayarde Mountalbon;
  Men se hym now and then[399]
  In the forest of[400] Arden:
  What though[401] I can frame
  The storyes by name                                                  660
  Of Judas Machabeus,
  And of Cesar Julious;
  And of the loue betwene
  Paris and Vyene;
  And of the duke Hannyball,[402]
  That[403] made the Romaynes all
  Fordrede and to quake;
  How Scipion dyd wake
  The cytye of Cartage,
  Which by his vnmerciful[404] rage                                    670
  He bete downe to the grounde:
  And though I can expounde
  Of Hector of Troye,
  That was all theyr ioye,
  Whom Achylles slew,
  Wherfore all Troy dyd rew;
  And of the loue so hote
  That made Troylus to dote
  Vpon fayre Cressyde,
  And what they wrote and sayd,                                        680
  And of theyr wanton wylles
  Pandaer bare the bylles
  From one to the other;
  His maisters loue to further,
  Somtyme a presyous thyng,
  An ouche, or els a ryng;
  From her to hym agayn
  Somtyme a prety chayn,
  Or a bracelet of her here,
  Prayd Troylus for to were                                            690
  That token for her sake;
  How hartely he dyd it take,
  And moche therof dyd make;
  And all that was in vayne,
  For she dyd but fayne;
  The story telleth playne,
  He coulde not optayne,
  Though his father were a kyng,
  Yet there was a thyng
  That made the[405] male to wryng;                                    700
  She made hym to syng
  The song of louers lay;
  Musyng nyght and day,
  Mournyng all alone,
  Comfort had he none,
  For she was quyte gone;
  Thus in conclusyon,
  She brought him in abusyon;
  In ernest and in game
  She was moch to blame;                                               710
  Disparaged is her fame,
  And blemysshed is her name,
  In maner half with shame;
  Troylus also hath lost
  On her moch loue and cost,
  And now must kys the post;
  Pandara, that went betwene,
  Hath won nothing, I wene,
  But lyght for somer grene;
  Yet for a speciall laud                                              720
  He is named Troylus baud,
  Of that name he is sure
  Whyles the world shall dure:
    Though I remembre the fable
  Of Penelope most stable,
  To her husband most trew,
  Yet long tyme she ne knew
  Whether he were on lyue or ded;
  Her wyt stood her in sted,
  That she was true and iust                                           730
  For any bodely lust
  To Ulixes her make,
  And neuer wold him forsake:
    Of Marcus Marcellus
  A proces I could tell vs;
  And of Anteocus;
  And of Josephus
  _De Antiquitatibus_;
  And of Mardocheus,
  And of great Assuerus,                                               740
  And of Vesca his queene,
  Whom he forsoke with teene,
  And of Hester his other wyfe,
  With whom he ledd a plesaunt life;
  Of kyng Alexander;
  And of kyng Euander;
  And of Porcena the great,
  That made the Romayns to sweat:[406]
    Though I haue enrold
  A thousand new and old                                               750
  Of these historious tales,
  To fyll bougets and males
  With bokes that I haue red,
  Yet I am nothyng sped,
  And can but lytell skyll
  Of Ouyd or Virgyll,
  Or of Plutharke,
  Or[407] Frauncys Petrarke,
  Alcheus or Sapho,
  Or such other poetes mo,                                             760
  As Linus and Homerus,
  Euphorion and Theocritus,
  Anacreon and Arion,
  Sophocles and Philemon,
  Pyndarus and Symonides,[408]
  Philistion[409] and Phorocides;
  These poetes of auncyente,
  They ar to diffuse for me:
    For, as I tofore haue sayd,
  I am but a yong mayd,                                                770
  And cannot in effect
  My style as yet direct
  With Englysh wordes elect:[410]
  Our naturall tong is rude,
  And hard to be enneude
  With pullysshed termes lusty;
  Our language is so rusty,
  So cankered, and so full
  Of frowardes, and so dull,
  That if I wolde apply                                                780
  To wryte ornatly,[411]
  I wot not where to fynd
  Termes to serue my mynde.
    Gowers Englysh is olde,
  And of no value told;[412]
  His mater is worth gold,
  And worthy to be enrold.
    In Chauser I am sped,
  His tales I haue red:
  His mater is delectable,                                             790
  Solacious, and commendable;
  His Englysh well alowed,
  So as it is enprowed,
  For as it is enployd,
  There is no Englysh voyd,
  At those dayes moch commended,
  And now men wold haue amended
  His Englysh, whereat they barke,
  And mar all they warke:
  Chaucer, that famus clerke,                                          800
  His termes were not darke,
  But plesaunt, easy, and playne;
  No[413] worde he wrote in vayne.
    Also Johnn Lydgate
  Wryteth after an hyer rate;
  It is dyffuse to fynde
  The sentence of his mynde,
  Yet wryteth he in his kynd,
  No man that can amend
  Those maters that he hath pende;                                     810
  Yet some men fynde a faute,
  And say he wryteth to haute.
    Wherfore hold me excused
  If I haue not well perused
  Myne Englyssh halfe abused;
  Though it be refused,
  In worth I shall it take,
  And fewer wordes make.
    But, for my sparowes sake,
  Yet as a woman may,                                                  820
  My wyt I shall assay
  An epytaphe to wryght
  In Latyne playne and lyght,
  Wherof the elegy
  Foloweth by and by:
  _Flos volucrum[414] formose, vale!_
  _Philippe, sub isto_
  _Marmore jam recubas,_
  _Qui mihi carus eras._
  _Semper erunt nitido_                                                830
  _Radiantia sidera cœlo;_
  _Impressusque meo_
  _Pectore semper eris._
  _Per me laurigerum_
  _Britonum Skeltonida vatem_
  _Hæc cecinisse licet_
  _Ficta sub imagine texta._
  _Cujus eras[415] volucris,_
  _Præstanti corpore virgo:_
  _Candida Nais erat,_                                                 840
  _Formosior ista Joanna est;_
  _Docta Corinna fuit,_
  _Sed magis ista sapit._
    _Bien men souient._

THE COMMENDACIONS.

    _Beati im ma cu la ti in via,_
  _O gloriosa fœmina!_
  Now myne hole imaginacion
  And studyous medytacion
  Is to take this commendacyon
  In this consyderacion;                                               850
  And vnder pacyent tolleracyon
  Of that most goodly[416] mayd
  That _Placebo_ hath sayd,
  And for her sparow prayd
  In lamentable wyse,
  Now wyll I enterpryse,
  Thorow the grace dyuyne
  Of the Muses nyne,
  Her beautye to commende,
  If Arethusa wyll send                                                860
  Me enfluence to endyte,
  And with my pen to wryte;
  If Apollo wyll promyse
  Melodyously it to[417] deuyse
  His tunable harpe stryngges
  With armony that synges
  Of princes and of kynges
  And of all pleasaunt thynges,
  Of lust and of delyght,
  Thorow his godly myght;                                              870
  To whom be the laude ascrybed
  That my pen hath enbybed
  With the aureat droppes,
  As verely my hope is,
  Of Thagus, that golden flod,
  That passeth all[418] erthly good;
  And as that flode doth pas
  Al floodes that euer was
  With his golden sandes,
  Who so that vnderstandes                                             880
  Cosmography, and the stremys
  And the floodes in straunge remes,
  Ryght so she doth excede
  All other of whom we rede,
  Whose fame by me shall sprede
  Into Perce and Mede,
  From Brytons Albion
  To[419] the Towre of Babilon.
    I trust it is no shame,
  And no man wyll me blame,                                            890
  Though I regester her name
  In the courte of Fame;
  For this most goodly floure,
  This blossome of fresshe coulour,
  So Jupiter me socour,
  She floryssheth new and new
  In bewte and vertew:
  _Hac claritate gemina_
  _O gloriosa fœmina,_
  _Retribue servo tuo, vivifica me!_                                   900
  _Labia mea laudabunt te._
    But enforsed am I
  Openly to askry,
  And to make an[420] outcri
  Against odyous Enui,
  That euermore wil ly,
  And say cursedly;
  With his ledder ey,
  And chekes dry;
  With vysage wan,                                                     910
  As swarte[421] as tan;
  His bones crake,
  Leane as a rake;
  His gummes rusty
  Are full vnlusty;
  Hys herte withall
  Bytter as gall;
  His lyuer, his longe[422]
  With anger is wronge;
  His serpentes tonge                                                  920
  That many one hath stonge;
  He frowneth euer;
  He laugheth neuer,
  Euen nor morow,
  But other mennes sorow
  Causeth him to gryn
  And reioyce therin;
  No slepe can him catch,
  But euer doth watch,
  He is so bete                                                        930
  With malyce, and frete
  With angre and yre,
  His foule desyre
  Wyll suffre no slepe
  In his hed to crepe;
  His foule[423] semblaunt
  All displeasaunte;[424]
  Whan other ar glad,
  Than is he sad;
  Frantyke and mad;                                                    940
  His tong neuer styll
  For to say yll,
  Wrythyng and wringyng,
  Bytyng and styngyng;
  And thus this elf
  Consumeth himself,
  Hymself doth slo
  Wyth payne and wo.
  This fals Enuy
  Sayth that I                                                         950
  Vse great folly
  For to endyte,
  And for to wryte,
  And spend my tyme
  In prose and ryme,
  For to expres
  The noblenes
  Of my maistres,
  That causeth me
  Studious to be                                                       960
  To[425] make a relation
  Of her commendation;
  And there agayne
  Enuy doth complayne,
  And hath disdayne;
  But yet certayne
  I wyll be[426] playne,
  And my style dres
  To this prosses.
    Now Phebus me ken                                                  970
  To sharpe my pen,
  And lede my fyst
  As hym best lyst,
  That I may say
  Honour alway
  Of womankynd!
  Trouth doth me bynd
  And loyalte
  Euer to be
  Their true bedell,                                                   980
  To wryte and tell
  How women excell
  In noblenes;
  As my maistres,
  Of whom I thynk
  With pen and ynk
  For to compyle
  Some goodly[427] style;
  For this most goodly[428] floure,
  This blossome of fresh coloure,                                      990
  So Jupyter me socoure,
  She flourissheth new and new
  In beaute and vertew:
  _Hac claritate gemina_
  _O gloriosa fœmina,_
  _Legem pone mihi, domina,[429] in viam justificationum tuarum!_
  _Quemadmodum desiderat cervus ad fontes aquarum._
    How shall I report
  All the goodly sort
  Of her fetures clere,                                               1000
  That hath non erthly pere?
  Her[430] fauour of her face
  Ennewed all with[431] grace,
  Confort, pleasure, and solace,
  Myne hert doth so enbrace,
  And so hath rauyshed me
  Her to behold and se,
  That in wordes playne
  I cannot me refrayne
  To loke on[432] her agayne:                                         1010
  Alas, what shuld I fayne?
  It wer a plesaunt payne
  With her aye to remayne.
    Her eyen gray and stepe
  Causeth myne hert to lepe;
  With her browes bent
  She may well represent
  Fayre Lucres, as I wene,
  Or els fayre Polexene,
  Or els Caliope,                                                     1020
  Or els Penolope;
  For this most goodly floure,
  This blossome of fresshe coloure,
  So Jupiter me socoure,
  She florisheth new and new
  In beautye and vertew:
  _Hac claritate gemina_
  _O gloriosa fœmina,_
  _Memor esto verbi tui servo tuo!_
  _Servus tuus sum ego._                                              1030
    The Indy saphyre blew
  Her vaynes doth ennew;
  The orient perle so clere,
  The whytnesse of her lere;
  The[433] lusty ruby ruddes
  Resemble the rose buddes;
  Her lyppes soft and mery
  Emblomed lyke the chery,
  It were an heuenly blysse
  Her sugred mouth to kysse.                                          1040
    Her beautye to augment,
  Dame Nature hath her lent
  A warte vpon her cheke,
  Who so lyst to seke
  In her vysage a skar,
  That semyth from afar
  Lyke to the radyant star,
  All with fauour fret,
  So properly it is set:
  She is the vyolet,                                                  1050
  The daysy delectable,
  The columbine[434] commendable,
  The[435] ielofer amyable;
  [For][436] this most goodly floure,
  This blossom of fressh colour,
  So Jupiter me succour,
  She florysheth new and new
  In beaute and vertew:
  _Hac claritate gemina_
  _O gloriosa fœmina,_                                                1060
  _Bonitatem fecisti cum servo tuo, domina,_
  _Et ex præcordiis sonant præconia!_
    And whan I perceyued
  Her wart and conceyued,
  It cannot be denayd
  But it was well conuayd,
  And set so womanly,
  And nothynge wantonly,
  But ryght conuenyently,
  And full congruently,                                               1070
  As Nature cold deuyse,
  In most goodly wyse;
  Who so lyst beholde,
  It makethe louers bolde
  To her to sewe for grace,
  Her fauoure to purchase;
  The sker upon her chyn,
  Enhached[437] on her fayre skyn,
  Whyter than the swan,
  It wold make any man                                                1080
  To forget deadly syn
  Her fauour to wyn;
  For this most goodly[438] floure,
  This blossom of fressh coloure,
  So Jupiter me socoure,
  She flouryssheth new and new
  In beaute and vertew:
  _Hac claritate gemina_
  _O gloriosa fœmina,_
  _Defecit in salutatione tua[439] anima mea;_                        1090
  _Quid petis filio, mater dulcissima? babæ!_[440]
    Soft, and make no dyn,
  For now I wyll begyn
  To haue[441] in remembraunce
  Her goodly dalyaunce,
  And her goodly pastaunce:
  So sad and so demure,
  Behauynge her so sure,
  With wordes of pleasure
  She wold make to the lure                                           1100
  And any man conuert
  To gyue her his hole hert.
  She made me sore amased
  Vpon her whan I gased,
  Me thought min hert was crased,
  My eyne were so dased;
  For this most goodly flour,
  This[442] blossom of fressh colour,
  So Jupyter me socour,
  She flouryssheth new and new                                        1110
  In beauty and vertew:
  _Hac claritate gemina_
  _O gloriosa fœmina,_
  _Quomodo dilexi legem tuam, domina!_
  _Recedant vetera, nova sint[443] omnia._
    And to amende her tale,
  Whan she lyst to auale,
  And with her fyngers smale,
  And handes soft as sylke,
  Whyter than the[444] mylke,                                         1120
  That are so quyckely vayned,
  Wherwyth my hand she strayned,
  Lorde, how I was payned!
  Vnneth I me refrayned,
  How she me had reclaymed,
  And me to her retayned,
  Enbrasynge therwithall
  Her goodly[445] myddell small
  With sydes longe and streyte;
  To tell you what conceyte                                           1130
  I had than in a tryce,
  The matter were to nyse,
  And yet there was no vyce,
  Nor yet no villany,
  But only fantasy;
  For this most goodly floure,
  This[446] blossom of fressh coloure,
  So Jupiter me succoure,
  She floryssheth new and new
  In beaute and vertew:                                               1140
  _Hac claritate gemina_
  _O gloriosa fœmina,_
  _Iniquos odio habui!_
  _Non calumnientur me superbi._
    But whereto shulde I note
  How often dyd I tote
  Vpon her prety fote?
  It raysed myne hert rote
  To se her treade the grounde
  With heles short and rounde.                                        1150
  She is playnly expresse
  Egeria, the goddesse,
  And lyke to her image,
  Emportured with corage,
  A louers pylgrimage;
  Ther is no beest sauage,
  Ne no tyger so wood,
  But she wolde chaunge his mood,
  Such relucent grace
  Is formed in her face;                                              1160
  For this most goodly floure,
  This blossome of fresshe coloure,
  So Jupiter me succour,
  She flouryssheth new and new
  In beaute and vertew:
  _Hac claritate gemina_
  _O gloriosa fœmina,_
  _Mirabilia testimonia tua!_
  _Sicut novellæ plantationes in juventute sua._
    So goodly as she dresses,                                         1170
  So properly[447] she presses
  The bryght golden tresses
  Of her heer so fyne,
  Lyke Phebus beames shyne.
  Wherto shuld I disclose
  The garterynge of her hose?
  It is for to suppose
  How that she can were
  Gorgiously her gere;
  Her fresshe habylementes                                            1180
  With other implementes
  To serue for all ententes,
  Lyke dame Flora, quene
  Of lusty somer grene;
  For[448] this most goodly floure,
  This blossom of fressh coloure,
  So Jupiter me socoure,
  She florisheth new and new
  In beautye and vertew:
  _Hac claritate gemina_                                              1190
  _O gloriosa fœmina,_
  _Clamavi in toto corde, exaudi me!_
  _Misericordia tua magna est super me._
    Her kyrtell so goodly lased,
  And vnder that is brased
  Such plasures that I may
  Neyther wryte nor say;
  Yet though I wryte not with ynke,
  No man can let me thynke,
  For thought hath lyberte,                                           1200
  Thought is franke and fre;
  To thynke a mery thought
  It cost me lytell nor[449] nought.
  Wolde God myne homely style
  Were pullysshed with the fyle
  Of Ciceros eloquence,
  To prase her excellence!
  For this[450] most goodly floure,
  This[451] blossome of fressh coloure,
  So Jupiter me succoure,                                             1210
  She flouryssheth new and new
  In beaute and vertew:
  _Hac claritate gemina_
  _O gloriosa fœmina,_
  _Principes persecuti sunt me gratis!_
  _Omnibus consideratis,_
  _Paradisus voluptatis_
  _Hæc virgo est dulcissima._
    My pen it is vnable,
  My hand it is vnstable,                                             1220
  My reson rude and dull
  To prayse her at the full;
  Goodly maystres Jane,
  Sobre, demure Dyane;
  Jane this maystres hyght
  The lode star[452] of delyght,
  Dame Venus of all pleasure,
  The well of worldly treasure;
  She doth excede and pas
  In prudence dame Pallas;                                            1230
  [For][453] this[454] most goodly floure,
  This blossome of fresshe colour,
  So Jupiter me socoure,
  She floryssheth new and new
  In beaute and vertew:
  _Hac claritate gemina_
  _O gloriosa fœmina!_
    _Requiem æternam dona eis, Domine!_
  With this psalme, _Domine, probasti me_,
  Shall sayle ouer the see,                                           1240
  With _Tibi, Domine, commendamus_,
  On pylgrimage[455] to saynt Jamys,
  For shrympes, and for pranys,
  And for stalkynge[456] cranys;
  And where my pen hath offendyd,
  I pray you it may be amendyd
  By discrete consyderacyon
  Of your wyse reformacyon;
  I haue not offended, I trust,
  If it be sadly dyscust.                                             1250
  It were no gentle gyse
  This treatyse to despyse
  Because I haue wrytten and sayd
  Honour of this fayre mayd;
  Wherefore shulde I be blamed,
  That I Jane haue[457] named,
  And famously proclamed?
  She is worthy to be enrolde
  With letters of golde.
        _Car elle vault._                                             1260
  _Per me laurigerum Britonum Skeltonida vatem[458]_
  _Laudibus eximiis merito hæc redimita puella est:_
  _Formosam cecini,[459] qua non formosior ulla est;_
  _Formosam potius quam commendaret Homerus._
  _Sic juvat interdum rigidos recreare labores,_
  _Nec minus hoc titulo tersa Minerva mea est._
          _Rien que playsere._

_Thus endeth the boke of Philip Sparow, and here foloweth an adicyon made
by maister Skelton._

    The gyse now a dayes
  Of some ianglynge iayes
  Is to discommende                                                   1270
  That they cannot amend,
  Though they wold spend
  All the wyttes they haue.
    What ayle them to depraue
  Phillip Sparowes graue?
  His _Dirige_, her Commendacyon
  Can be no derogacyon,
  But myrth and consolacyon
  Made by protestacyon,
  No man to myscontent                                                1280
  With Phillyppes enterement.
    Alas, that goodly mayd,
  Why shuld she be afrayde?
  Why shuld she take shame
  That her goodly name,
  Honorably reported,
  Sholde be set and sorted,
  To be matriculate
  With ladyes of estate?
    I coniure thé, Phillip Sparow,                                    1290
  By Hercules that hell dyd harow,
  And with a venemous arow
  Slew of the Epidaures
  One of the Centaures,
  Or Onocentaures,
  Or Hipocentaures;[460]
  By whose myght and mayne
  An hart was slayne
  With hornes twayne
  Of glytteryng gold;                                                 1300
  And the appels of gold
  Of Hesperides withhold,
  And with a dragon kept
  That neuer more slept,
  By marcyall strength
  He wan at length;
  And slew Gerion
  With thre bodyes in one;
  With myghty corage
  Adauntid[461] the rage                                              1310
  Of a lyon sauage;
  Of Dyomedes stable
  He brought out a rable
  Of coursers and rounses
  With leapes and bounses;
  And with mighty luggyng,
  Wrestlyng and tuggyng,
  He plucked the bull
  By the horned skull,
  And offred to Cornucopia;                                           1320
  And so forth _per cetera_:
    Also by Ecates bower
  In Plutos[462] gastly tower;
    By the vgly Eumenides,
  That neuer haue rest nor ease;
    By the venemous serpent,
  That in hell is neuer brent,
  In Lerna the Grekes fen,
  That was engendred then;
    By Chemeras flames,                                               1330
  And all the dedly names
  Of infernall posty,
  Where soules frye and rosty;[463]
    By the Stygyall flood,
  And the streames wood
  Of Cocitus botumles well;
    By the feryman of hell,
  Caron with his beerd hore,
  That roweth with a rude ore
  And with his frownsid[464] fore top                                 1340
  Gydeth his bote with a prop:
    I coniure[465] Phylyp, and call
  In the name of kyng Saul;
  _Primo Regum_ expresse,
  He bad[466] the Phitonesse
  To wytchcraft her to dresse,
  And by her abusyons,
  And dampnable illusyons
  Of marueylus conclusyons,
  And by her supersticyons,                                           1350
  And wonderfull condityons,
  She raysed vp in that stede
  Samuell that was dede;
  But whether it were so,
  He were _idem in numero_,
  The selfe same Samuell,
  How be it to Saull dyd he tell
  The Philistinis shuld hym ascry,
  And the next day he shuld dye,
  I wyll my selfe dyscharge                                           1360
  To lettred men at large:
    But, Phylyp, I coniure thee
  Now by these names thre,
  Diana in the woodes grene,
  Luna that so bryght doth shene,[467]
  Procerpina in hell,
  That thou shortly tell,
  And shew now vnto me
  What the cause may be
  Of this perplexite!                                                 1370

    Than suche as haue disdayned
  And of this worke complayned,
  I pray God they be payned
  No worse than is contayned
  In verses two or thre
  That folowe as you[472] may se.

HERE AFTER FOLOWETH[474] THE BOOKE CALLED ELYNOUR RUMMYNGE.

THE TUNNYNG OF ELYNOUR RUMMYNG PER SKELTON LAUREAT.


  Tell you I chyll,
  If that ye wyll
  A whyle be styll,
  Of a comely gyll
  That dwelt on a hyll:
  But she is not gryll,
  For she is somwhat sage
  And well worne in age;
  For her vysage
  It would aswage                                                       10
  A mannes courage.
    Her lothely lere
  Is nothynge clere,
  But vgly of chere,
  Droupy and drowsy,
  Scuruy and lowsy;
  Her face all bowsy,
  Comely crynklyd,
  Woundersly wrynkled,
  Lyke a rost pygges eare,                                              20
  Brystled wyth here.
    Her lewde lyppes twayne,
  They slauer, men sayne,
  Lyke a ropy rayne,
  A gummy glayre:
  She is vgly fayre;
  Her nose somdele hoked,
  And camously croked,
  Neuer stoppynge,
  But euer droppynge;                                                   30
  Her skynne lose and slacke,
  Grained[475] lyke a sacke;
  With a croked backe.
    Her eyen gowndy
  Are full vnsowndy,
  For they are blered;
  And she gray hered;
  Jawed lyke a jetty;
  A man would haue pytty
  To se how she is gumbed,                                              40
  Fyngered and thumbed,
  Gently ioynted,
  Gresed and annoynted
  Vp to the knockels;
  The bones [of] her huckels[476]
  Lyke as they were with buckels[477]
  Togyther made fast:
  Her youth is farre past:
  Foted lyke a plane,
  Legged[478] lyke a crane;                                             50
  And yet she wyll iet,
  Lyke a iolly fet,[479]
  In her furred flocket,
  And gray russet rocket,
  With symper the cocket.
  Her huke of Lyncole grene,
  It had ben hers, I wene,
  More then fourty yere;
  And so doth it[480] apere,
  For[481] the grene bare thredes                                       60
  Loke lyke sere wedes,
  Wyddered lyke hay,
  The woll worne away;
  And yet I dare saye
  She thynketh herselfe gaye
  Vpon the holy daye,
  Whan she doth her aray,
  And gyrdeth in her gytes[482]
  Stytched and pranked with pletes;[483]
  Her kyrtel Brystow red,                                               70
  With clothes vpon her hed
  That wey[484] a sowe of led,
  Wrythen in[485] wonder wyse,
  After the Sarasyns gyse,
  With a whym wham,
  Knyt with a trym tram,
  Vpon her brayne pan,
  Lyke an Egyptian,
  Capped[486] about:
  Whan she goeth out                                                    80
  Herselfe for to shewe,
  She dryueth downe the dewe
  Wyth a payre of heles
  As brode as two wheles;
  She hobles as a gose[487]
  With her blanket[488] hose
  Ouer the falowe;[489]
  Her shone smered wyth talowe,
  Gresed vpon dyrt
  That baudeth her skyrt.                                               90

_Primus passus._

    And this comely dame,
  I vnderstande, her name
  Is Elynour Rummynge,
  At home in her wonnynge;
  And as men say
  She dwelt[490] in Sothray,
  In a certayne stede
  Bysyde Lederhede.
  She is a tonnysh gyb;
  The deuyll and she be syb.                                           100
    But to make vp my tale,
  She breweth noppy ale,
  And maketh therof port sale[491]
  To trauellars, to tynkers,
  To sweters, to swynkers,
  And all good ale drynkers,
  That wyll nothynge spare,
  But drynke tyll they stare
  And brynge themselfe bare,
  With, Now away the mare,                                             110
  And let vs sley care,
  As wyse as an hare!
    Come who so wyll
  To Elynour on the hyll,
  Wyth, Fyll the cup, fyll,
  And syt there by styll,
  Erly and late:
  Thyther cometh Kate,
  Cysly, and Sare,
  With theyr legges bare,                                              120
  And also theyr fete
  Hardely full vnswete;
  Wyth theyr heles dagged,
  Theyr kyrtelles all to-iagged,
  Theyr smockes all to-ragged,
  Wyth tytters and tatters,
  Brynge dysshes and platters,
  Wyth all theyr myght runnynge
  To Elynour Rummynge,
  To haue of her tunnynge:                                             130
  She leneth them on[492] the same,
  And thus begynneth the game.
    Some wenches come vnlased,[493]
  Some huswyues[494] come vnbrased,
  Wyth theyr naked pappes,
  That flyppes and flappes;
  It wygges and it[495] wagges,
  Lyke tawny saffron bagges;
  A sorte of foule drabbes
  All scuruy with scabbes:                                             140
  Some be flybytten,
  Some skewed as a kytten;
  Some wyth a sho clout
  Bynde theyr heddes about;
  Some haue no herelace,
  Theyr lockes about theyr face,
  Theyr tresses vntrust,
  All full of vnlust;
  Some loke strawry,
  Some cawry mawry;                                                    150
  Full vntydy tegges,
  Lyke rotten egges.
  Suche a lewde sorte
  To Elynour resorte
  From tyde to tyde:
  Abyde, abyde,
  And to you shall be tolde
  Howe hyr ale is solde
  To Mawte and to Molde.

_Secundus passus._

    Some haue no mony                                                  160
  That thyder commy,
  For theyr ale to pay,
  That is a shreud aray;
  Elynour swered, Nay,
  Ye shall not beare away
  My[496] ale for nought,
  By hym that me bought!
    With, Hey, dogge, hay,
  Haue these hogges[497] away!
  With, Get me a staffe,                                               170
  The swyne eate my draffe!
  Stryke the hogges with a clubbe,
  They haue dronke vp my swyllynge tubbe!
  For, be there neuer so much prese,
  These swyne go to the hye dese,
  The sowe with her pygges;
  The bore his tayle wrygges,
  His rumpe[498] also he frygges
  Agaynst[499] the hye benche!
  With, Fo, ther is a stenche!                                         180
  Gather vp, thou wenche;
  Seest thou not what is fall?
  Take vp dyrt[500] and all,
  And bere out of the hall:
  God gyue it yll preuynge,
  Clenly as yuell cheuynge!
    But let vs turne playne,
  There we lefte agayne.
  For, as yll a patch as that,
  The hennes ron in the mashfat;                                       190
  For they go to roust
  Streyght ouer the ale ioust,
  And donge, whan it commes,
  In the ale tunnes.
  Than Elynour taketh
  The mashe bolle, and shaketh
  The hennes donge away,
  And skommeth it into[501] a tray
  Whereas the yeest is,
  With her maungy fystis:                                              200
  And somtyme she blennes
  The donge of her hennes
  And the ale together;
  And sayeth, Gossyp, come hyther,
  This ale shal be thycker,
  And flowre the more quicker;
  For I may tell you,
  I lerned it of a Jewe,
  Whan I began to brewe,
  And I haue founde it trew;                                           210
  Drinke now whyle it is new;
  And ye may it broke,
  It shall make you loke
  Yonger than ye be
  Yeres two or thre,
  For ye may proue it by me;
  Beholde, she sayde, and se
  How bryght I am of ble!
  Ich am not cast away,
  That can my husband say,                                             220
  Whan we kys and play
  In lust and in lykyng;
  He calleth me his whytyng,
  His mullyng and his mytyng,[502]
  His nobbes and his conny,
  His swetyng and his honny,
  With, Bas, my prety bonny,
  Thou art worth good and monny.
  This make I my falyre fonny,[503]
  Til that he dreme and dronny;                                        230
  For, after all our sport,
  Than wyll he rout and snort;
  Than swetely together we ly,
  As two pygges in a sty.
    To cease me semeth best,
  And of this tale to rest,
  And for to leue this letter,
  Because it is no better,
  And because it is no swetter;
  We wyll no farther ryme                                              240
  Of it at this tyme;
  But we wyll turne playne
  Where we left agayne.

_Tertius passus._

    Instede of coyne and monny,[504]
  Some brynge her a conny,
  And some a pot with honny,
  Some a salt, and some a spone,
  Some theyr hose, some theyr shone;
  Some ran[505] a good trot
  With a skellet or a pot;                                             250
  Some fyll theyr pot full
  Of good Lemster woll:
  An huswyfe of trust,
  Whan she is athrust,
  Suche a webbe can spyn,
  Her thryft is full thyn.
    Some go streyght thyder,
  Be it slaty or slyder;
  They holde the hye waye,
  They care not what men say,                                          260
  Be that as be maye;
  Some, lothe to be espyde,
  Start[506] in at the backe syde,
  Ouer the hedge and pale,
  And all for the good ale.
    Some renne tyll they swete,
  Brynge wyth them malte or whete,
  And dame Elynour entrete
  To byrle them of the best.
    Than cometh an other gest;                                         270
  She swered by the rode of rest,
  Her lyppes are so drye,
  Without drynke she must dye;
  Therefore fyll it by and by,
  And haue here a pecke of ry.
    Anone cometh another,
  As drye as the other,
  And wyth her doth brynge
  Mele, salte, or other thynge,
  Her haruest[507] gyrdle, her weddynge rynge,                         280
  To pay for her scot
  As cometh to her lot.
  Som bryngeth her husbandes hood,
  Because the ale is good;
  Another brought her his cap
  To offer to the ale tap,
  Wyth flaxe and wyth towe;
  And some brought sowre dowe;
  Wyth, Hey, and wyth, howe,
  Syt we downe a rowe,                                                 290
  And drynke tyll we blowe,
  And pype tyrly tyrlowe!
    Some layde to pledge
  Theyr hatchet and theyr wedge,
  Theyr hekell and theyr rele,
  Theyr rocke, theyr spynnyng whele;
  And some went so narrowe,
  They layde to pledge theyr wharrowe,
  Theyr rybskyn and theyr spyndell,
  Theyr nedell and theyr thymbell:                                     300
  Here was scant thryft
  Whan they made suche shyft.
    Theyr thrust was so great,
  They asked neuer for mete,
  But drynke, styll drynke,
  And let the cat wynke,
  Let vs washe our gommes
  From the drye crommes.

_Quartus passus._

    Some for very nede
  Layde[508] downe a skeyne of threde,                                 310
  And some a skeyne of yarne;
  Some brought[509] from the barne
  Both benes and pease;
  Small chaffer doth ease
  Sometyme, now and than:
  Another there was that ran
  With a good brasse pan;
  Her colour was full wan;
  She ran in all the hast
  Vnbrased and vnlast;                                                 320
  Tawny, swart, and sallowe,[510]
  Lyke a cake of tallowe;
  I swere by all hallow,
  It was a stale[511] to take
  The deuyll in a brake.
    And than came haltyng Jone,
  And brought a gambone
  Of bakon that was resty:
  But, Lorde, as she was testy,
  Angry as a waspy!                                                    330
  She began to yane and gaspy,
  And bad Elynour go bet,
  And fyll in good met;[512]
  It was dere that was farre fet.
    Another brought a spycke
  Of a bacon flycke;
  Her tonge was verye quycke,
  But she spake somwhat thycke:
  Her felow did stammer and stut,
  But she was a foule slut,                                            340
  For her mouth fomyd
  And her bely groned:
  Jone sayne[513] she had eaten a fyest;
  By Christ, sayde she, thou lyest,
  I haue as swete a breth
  As thou, wyth shamfull deth!
    Than Elynour sayde, Ye callettes,
  I shall breake your palettes,
  Wythout ye now cease!
  And so was made the peace.[514]                                      350
    Than thyder came dronken Ales;
  And she was full of tales,
  Of tydynges in Wales,
  And of sainct James in Gales,
  And of the Portyngales;
  Wyth, Lo, gossyp, I wys,
  Thus and thus it is,
  There hath ben great war
  Betwene Temple Bar
  And the Crosse in Chepe,                                             360
  And there came an hepe
  Of mylstones in a route:
  She speketh thus in her snout,
  Sneuelyng in her nose,
  As thoughe she had the pose;
  Lo, here is an olde typpet,
  And ye wyll gyue me a syppet
  Of your stale ale,
  God sende you good sale!
  And as she was drynkynge,                                            370
  She fyll[515] in a wynkynge
  Wyth a barlyhood,
  She pyst where she stood;
  Than began she to wepe,
  And forthwyth fell on slepe.
  Elynour toke her vp,
  And blessed her wyth a cup
  Of newe ale in cornes;
  Ales founde therin no thornes,
  But supped it vp at ones,                                            380
  She founde therin no bones.[516]

_Quintus passus._

    Nowe in cometh another rabell;
  Fyrst one wyth a ladell,
  Another wyth a cradell,
  And wyth a syde sadell:
  And there began a fabell,
  A clatterynge and a babell
  Of folys fylly[517]
  That had a fole wyth wylly,
  With, Iast you, and, gup, gylly!                                     390
  She coulde not lye stylly.
    Then came in a genet,
  And sware by saynct Benet,
  I dranke not this sennet
  A draught to my pay;
  Elynour, I thé pray,
  Of thyne ale let vs assay,
  And haue here a pylche of gray;
  I were skynnes of conny,
  That causeth I loke so donny.                                        400
    Another than dyd hyche her,
  And brought a pottel pycher,
  A tonnel, and a bottell,
  But she had lost the stoppell;
  She cut of her sho sole,
  And stopped therwyth the hole.
    Amonge all the blommer,
  Another brought a skommer,
  A fryinge pan, and a slyce;
  Elynour made the pryce                                               410
  For good ale eche whyt.
    Than sterte in mad Kyt,
  That had lyttle wyt;
  She semed somdele seke,
  And brought[518] a peny cheke
  To dame Elynour,
  For a draught of lycour.
    Than Margery Mylkeducke
  Her kyrtell she did vptucke
  An ynche aboue her kne,                                              420
  Her legges that ye myght se;
  But they were sturdy and stubbed,[519]
  Myghty pestels and clubbed,
  As fayre and as whyte
  As the fote of a kyte:
  She was somwhat foule,
  Crokenecked lyke an oule;
  And yet she brought her fees,
  A cantell of Essex chese
  Was well a fote thycke,                                              430
  Full of maggottes quycke;
  It was huge and greate,
  And myghty stronge meate
  For the deuyll to eate;
  It was tart and punyete.
    Another sorte of sluttes,
  Some brought walnuttes,[520]
  Some apples, some peres,
  Some brought theyr clyppynge sheres,
  Some brought this and that,                                          440
  Some brought I wote nere what,
  Some brought theyr husbandes hat,
  Some podynges and lynkes,
  Some trypes that stynkes.[521]
    But of all this thronge
  One came them amonge,
  She semed halfe a leche,
  And began to preche
  Of the tewsday in the weke
  Whan the mare doth keke;                                             450
  Of the vertue of an vnset leke;
  Of her husbandes breke;
  Wyth the feders of a quale
  She could to Burdeou[522] sayle;
  And wyth good ale barme
  She could make a charme
  To helpe wythall a stytch:
  She semed to be a wytch.
    Another brought two goslynges,
  That were noughty froslynges;                                        460
  She[523] brought them in a wallet,
  She was a cumly callet:
  The goslenges were untyde;
  Elynour began to chyde,
  They[524] be wretchockes[525] thou hast brought,
  They are shyre shakyng nought!

_Sextus passus._

    Maude Ruggy thyther skypped:
  She was vgly hypped,
  And vgly thycke lypped,
  Lyke an onyon syded,                                                 470
  Lyke tan ledder hyded:
  She had her so guyded
  Betwene the cup and the wall,
  That she was there wythall
  Into a palsey fall;
  Wyth that her hed shaked,
  And her handes quaked:
  Ones hed wold haue aked
  To se her naked:
  She dranke so of the dregges,[526]                                   480
  The dropsy was in her legges;
  Her face glystryng lyke glas;
  All foggy fat she was;
  She had also the gout
  In all her ioyntes about;
  Her breth was soure and stale,
  And smelled all of ale:
  Suche a bedfellaw
  Wold make one cast his craw;
  But yet for all that                                                 490
  She dranke on the mash fat.
    There came an old rybybe;
  She halted of a kybe,
  And had broken her shyn
  At the threshold comyng in,
  And fell so wyde open
  That one myght se her token,
  The deuyll thereon be wroken!
  What nede all this be spoken?
  She yelled lyke a calfe:                                             500
  Ryse vp, on Gods halfe,
  Said Elynour Rummyng,
  I beshrew thé for thy cummyng!
  And[527] as she at her did pluck,
  Quake, quake, sayd the duck
  In that lampatrams lap;
  Wyth, Fy, couer thy[528] shap
  Wyth sum flyp flap!
  God gyue it yll hap,
  Sayde Elynour for shame,                                             510
  Lyke an honest dame.
  Vp she stert, halfe lame,
  And skantly could go
  For payne and for wo.
    In came another dant,
  Wyth a gose and a gant:
  She had a wide[529] wesant;
  She was nothynge plesant;
  Necked lyke an olyfant;
  It was a bullyfant,                                                  520
  A gredy cormerant.
    Another brought her garlyke hedes;[530]
  Another brought her bedes
  Of iet or of cole,
  To offer to the ale pole:
  Some brought a wymble,
  Some brought a thymble,
  Some brought a sylke lace,
  Some brought a pyncase,
  Some her husbandes gowne,                                            530
  Some a pyllow of downe,
  Some of[531] the napery;
  And all this shyfte they make
  For the good ale sake.
    A strawe, sayde Bele, stande vtter,
  For we haue egges and butter,
  And of[532] pygeons a payre.
    Than sterte forth a fysgygge,[533]
  And she brought a bore pygge;
  The fleshe therof was ranke,                                         540
  And her brethe strongly stanke,
  Yet, or she went, she dranke,
  And gat her great thanke
  Of Elynour for her ware,
  That she thyther bare
  To pay for her share.
  Now truly, to my thynkynge,
  This is a solempne drinkynge.

_Septimus passus._

    Soft, quod one, hyght[534] Sybbyll,
  And let me wyth you bybyll.                                          550
  She sat downe in the place,
  With a sory face
  Wheywormed about;
  Garnyshed was her snout
  Wyth here and there a puscull,
  Lyke a scabbyd muscull.
  This ale, sayde she, is noppy;
  Let vs syppe and soppy,
  And not spyll a droppy,
  For so mote I hoppy,                                                 560
  It coleth well my croppy.[535]
    Dame Elynoure, sayde she,
  Haue here is for me,
  A cloute of London pynnes;
  And wyth that she begynnes
  The pot to her plucke,
  And dranke a good lucke;
  She swynged[536] vp a quarte
  At ones for her parte;
  Her paunche was so puffed,                                           570
  And so wyth ale stuffed,
  Had she not hyed apace,
  She had defoyled the place.
    Than began the sporte
  Amonge that dronken sorte:
  Dame Eleynour, sayde they,
  Lende here a cocke of hey,
  To make all thynge cleane;
  Ye wote well what we meane.
    But, syr, among all                                                580
  That sat in that hall,
  There was a pryckemedenty,
  Sat lyke a seynty,
  And began to paynty,
  As thoughe she would faynty;
  She made it as koy
  As a lege de moy;[537]
  She was not halfe so wyse
  As she was peuysshe nyse.
  She sayde neuer a worde,                                             590
  But rose from the borde,
  And called for our dame,
  Elynour by name.
  We supposed, I wys,
  That she rose to pys;
  But the very grounde
  Was for to compounde
  Wyth Elynour in the spence,
  To pay for her expence:
  I haue no penny nor grote                                            600
  To pay, sayde she, God wote,
  For washyng of my throte;
  But my bedes of amber
  Bere them to your chamber.
  Then Elynour dyd them hyde
  Wythin her beddes syde.
    But some than sat ryght sad
  That nothynge had
  There of theyr awne,[538]
  Neyther gelt nor pawne;                                              610
  Suche were there menny
  That had not a penny,
  But, whan they should walke,
  Were fayne wyth a chalke
  To score on the balke,
  Or score on the tayle:
  God gyue it yll hayle!
  For my fyngers[539] ytche;
  I haue wrytten to mytche
  Of this mad mummynge                                                 620
  Of Elynour Rummynge.
  Thus endeth the gest
  Of this worthy fest.

POEMS AGAINST GARNESCHE.


SKELTON LAURIATE[544] DEFEND[ER] AGENST M[ASTER] GARNESCHE CHALENGER, ET
CETERA.

  Sithe ye haue me chalyngyd, M[aster] Garnesche,
    Ruduly revilyng me in the kynges noble hall,
  Soche an odyr chalyngyr cowde me no man wysch,[545]
    But yf yt war Syr Tyrmagant that tyrnyd with out nall;[546]
    For Syr Frollo de Franko was neuer halfe so talle.
  But sey me now, Syr Satrapas, what autoryte ye haue
  In your chalenge, Syr Chystyn, to cale me knaue?

  What, haue ye kythyd yow a knyght, Syr Dugles the dowty,
    So currysly to beknaue me in the kynges place?[547]
  Ye stronge sturdy stalyon, so sterne and stowty,                      10
    Ye bere yow bolde as Barabas, or Syr Terry of Trace;[548]
    Ye gyrne grymly with your gomys and with your grysly face.
  But sey me yet, Syr Satropas, what auctoryte ye haue
  In your chalange, Syr Chesten, to calle me a knaue?

  Ye fowle, fers and felle, as Syr Ferumbras the ffreke,
    Syr capten of Catywade, catacumbas of Cayre,
  Thow ye be lusty as Syr Lybyus launces to breke,
    Yet your contenons oncomly, your face ys nat fayer:
    For alle your proude prankyng, your pride may apayere.
  But sey me yet, Syr Satrapas, wat auctoryte ye haue                   20
  In your chalenge, Syr Chesten, to cal me a knaue?

  Of Mantryble the Bryge, Malchus the murryon,
    Nor blake Baltazar with hys basnet routh as a bere,
  Nor Lycon, that lothly luske, in myn opynyon,
    Nor no bore so brymly brystlyd ys with here,
    As ye ar brystlyd on the bake for alle your gay gere.
  [But sey me yet, Syr Satrapas, what auctoryte ye haue
  In your chalenge, Syr Chesten, to calle me a knaue?]

  Your wynde schakyn shankkes, your longe lothy legges,
    Crokyd as a camoke, and as a kowe calfles,                          30
  Bryngges yow out of fauyr with alle femall teggys:
    That mastres Punt put yow of, yt was nat alle causeles;
    At Orwelle hyr hauyn your anggre was laules.
  [But sey me yet, Syr Satrapas, what auctoryte ye haue
  In your chalenge, Syr Chesten, to calle me a knaue?]

  I sey, ye solem Sarson, alle blake ys your ble;
    As a glede glowynge, your ien glyster as glasse,
  Rowlynge in yower holow hede, vgly to see;
    Your tethe teintyd with tawny; your semely[549] snowte doth passe,
    Howkyd as an hawkys beke, lyke Syr Topyas.                          40
  Boldly bend you to batell, and buske your selfe to saue:

[544] _Skelton Lauriate, &c._] These Poems against Garnesche (now for the
first time printed) are from a MS. in the Harleian Collection, 367 (fol.
101), which is in many parts scarcely legible, being written in a hand
very difficult to decipher, as well as being much injured by damp.

[545] _wysch_] So MS. seems to read.

[546] _with out nall_] Seems to be the reading of MS.,—“nall” having been
added, instead of “alle” which is drawn through with the pen.

[547] _place_] Might be read perhaps “palace.”

[548] _Trace_] MS. “Tracy.”

[549] _semely_] Appears at first sight to be “sriuely;” but compare v.
131 of the concluding poem against Garnesche.

  And grow all oute of kynde,
  To occupy so your mynde;
  For reson can I non fynde

  So for a knaue to clatyr;
  Ye wolde be callyd a maker,
  And make moche lyke Jake Rakar;

  And so puauntely dothe smelle,
  And so haynnously doth stynke,
  That naythyr pump nor synke

  Ageynst a stormy shouer.
  O ladis of bryght colour,
  Of bewte that beryth the flower,
  When Garnyche cummyth yow amonge                                     150

[559] _Crotoniati_] Should be “Crotoniatæ.” (Vide _De Invent. Rhet._)

[560] _They_] Compare v. 173 of the preceding poem.

[561] _Sayth from, &c._] This line added to MS. in (perhaps) a different
hand.

[562] _can_] MS. seems to read “cam.”

[563] _holde_] MS. “bolde.”

[564] _wyl_] Compare v. 135.

[565] _rybawde_] MS. seems to have “rylowde.”

[566] _Withowte thou leue, &c._] In MS. the latter part of this line, and
the concluding portions of the next two lines, are so injured by stains
that I can only guess at the words. The endings of the third and fourth
lines after this are illegible.

[567] _callyst_] MS. “callydst.”

[568] _Wher_] Seems to be the reading of MS.

[569] _wyll_] Compare v. 97.

[570] _Haftar_] MS. “hastar;” see notes.




SKELTON LAVREATE, ORATORIS REGIS TERTIUS,[571] AGAINST VENEMOUS
TONGUES[572] ENPOYSONED WITH SCLAUNDER AND FALSE DETRACTIONS, &c.


_Quid detur tibi, aut quid apponatur tibi ad linguam dolosam?_ Psalm. c.
xlij.

_Deus destruet te in finem; evellet te, et emigrabit te de tabernaculo
tuo, et radicem tuam de terra viventium._ Psal. lxvii.

  Al maters wel pondred and wel to be regarded,
  How shuld a fals lying tung then be rewarded?
  Such tunges shuld be torne out by the harde rootes,
  Hoyning like hogges that groynis and wrotes.

_Dilexisti omnia verba præcipitationis, lingua dolosa._ Ubi s. _&c._

  For, as I haue rede in volumes olde,
  A fals lying tunge is harde to withholde;
  A sclaunderous tunge, a tunge of a skolde,
  Worketh more mischiefe than can be tolde;
  That, if I wist not to be controlde,
  Yet somwhat to say I dare well be bolde,
  How some delite for to lye thycke and threfolde.

_Ad sannam hominem redigit comice[573] et graphice._

  For ye said, that he said, that I said, wote ye what?
  I made, he said, a windmil of an olde mat:
  If there be none other mater but that,
  Than ye may commaunde me to gentil Cok wat.

_Hic notat purpuraria arte intextas literas Romanas in amictibus post
ambulonum[574] ante et retro._

  For before on your brest, and behind on your back,
  In Romaine letters I neuer founde lack:
  In your crosse rowe nor Christ crosse you spede,
  Your Pater noster, your Aue, nor your Crede.
  Who soeuer that tale vnto you tolde,
  He saith vntruly, to say that I would
  Controlle the cognisaunce of noble men
  Either by language or with my pen.

_Pædagogium meum de sublimiori Minerva constat esse: ergo, &c._

  My scole is more solem and somwhat more haute
  Than to be founde in any such faute.

_Pædagogium meum male sanos maledicos sibilis complosisque manibus[575]
explodit, &c._

  My scoles are not for vnthriftes vntaught,
  For frantick faitours half mad and half straught;
  But my learning is of an other degree
  To taunt theim like liddrous, lewde as thei bee.

_Laxent ergo antennam elationis suæ inflatam vento vanitatis._ li. ille,
_&c._

  For though some be lidder, and list for to rayle,
  Yet to lie vpon me they can not preuayle:
  Then let them vale a bonet of their proud sayle,
  And of their taunting toies rest with il hayle.

_Nobilitati ignobilis cedat vilitas, &c._

  There is no noble man wil iudge in me
  Any such foly to rest or to be:
  I care muche the lesse what euer they say,
  For tunges vntayde be renning astray;
  But yet I may say safely, so many wel lettred
  Embraudred, enlasid together, and fettred,
  And so little learning, so lewdly alowed,
  What fault find ye herein but may be auowed?
  But ye are so full of vertibilite,
  And of frenetyke folabilite,                                          10
  And of melancoly mutabilite,
  That ye would coarte and enforce me
  Nothing to write, but hay the gy of thre,
  And I to suffre you lewdly to ly
  Of me with your language full of vilany!

_Sicut novacula[576] acuta fecisti dolum._ Ubi s.

  Malicious tunges, though they haue no bones,
  Are sharper then swordes, sturdier then stones.

_Lege Philostratum de vita Tyanæi Apollonii._

  Sharper then raysors that shaue and cut throtes,
  More stinging then scorpions that stang Pharaotis.

_Venenum aspidum sub labiis eorum._ Ps.

  More venemous and much more virulent
  Then any poysoned tode or any serpent.

_Quid peregrinis egemus exemplis? ad domestica recurramus, &c._ li. ille.

  Such tunges vnhappy hath made great diuision
  In realmes, in cities, by suche fals abusion;
  Of fals fickil tunges suche cloked collusion
  Hath brought nobil princes to extreme confusion.

_Quicquid loquantur, ut effœminantur, ita effantur, &c._

  Somtime women were put in great blame,
  Men said they could not their tunges atame;
  But men take vpon theim nowe all the shame,
  With skolding and sklaundering make their tungs lame.

_Novarum rerum cupidissimi, captatores, delatores, adulatores,
invigilatores, deliratores, &c. id genus._ li. ille.

  For men be now tratlers and tellers of tales;
  What tidings at Totnam,[577] what newis in Wales,
  What shippis are sailing to Scalis Mails?
  And all is not worth a couple of nut shalis:
  But lering and lurking here and there like spies;
  The deuil tere their tunges and pike out their ies!
  Then ren they with lesinges and blow them about,
  With, He wrate suche a bil withouten dout;
  With, I can tel you what such a man said;
  And you knew all, ye would be ill apayd.                              10

_De more vulpino, gannientes ad aurem, fictas fabellas fabricant._ li.
ille.

_Inauspicatum, male ominatum, infortunatum se fateatur habuisse
horoscopum, quicunque maledixerit vati Pierio, S[keltonidi] L[aureato],
&c._

  But if that I knewe what his name hight,
  For clatering of me I would him sone quight;
  For his false lying, of that I spake neuer,
  I could make him shortly repent him for euer:
  Although he made it neuer so tough,
  He might be sure to haue shame ynough.

  _Cerberus horrendo barathri latrando sub antro_
    _Te rodatque voret, lingua dolosa, precor._

  A fals double tunge is more fiers and fell
  Then Cerberus the cur couching in the kenel of hel;
  Wherof hereafter I thinke for to write,
  Of fals double tunges in the dispite.

_Recipit se scripturum opus sanctum,[578] laudabile, acceptabile,

          Ye may here now,[579] in this ryme,
          How euery thing must haue a tyme.

  Tyme is a thing that no man may resyst;
    Tyme is trancytory and irreuocable;[580]
  Who sayeth the contrary, tyme passeth as hym lyst;
    Tyme must be taken in season couenable;
    Take tyme when tyme is, for tyme is ay mutable;
  All thynge hath tyme, who can for it prouyde;
  Byde for tyme who wyll, for tyme wyll no man byde.[581]

  Tyme to be sad, and tyme to play and sporte;                          10
    Tyme to take rest by way of recreacion;[582]
  Tyme to study, and tyme to use comfort;
    Tyme of pleasure, and tyme of consolation:
    Thus tyme hath his tyme of diuers maner facion:
  Tyme for to eate and drynke for thy repast;
  Tyme to be lyberall, and tyme to make no wast;

  Tyme to trauell, and tyme for to rest;
    Tyme for to speake, and tyme to[583] holde thy pease;
  Tyme would be vsed when tyme is best;
    Tyme to begyn, and tyme for to cease;                               20
    And when tyme is, [to] put thyselfe in prease,
  And when tyme is, to holde thyselfe abacke;
  For tyme well spent can neuer haue lacke.

  The rotys take theyr sap in tyme of vere;
    In tyme of somer flowres fresh and grene;
  In tyme of haruest men their corne shere;
    In tyme of wynter the north wynde waxeth kene,
    So bytterly bytynge the flowres be not sene;
  The kalendis of Janus, with his frostes hore,
  That tyme is when people must lyue vpon the store.                    30

          It may not be naid;

  Beholde me, I pray thé, with all thi hole reson,
  And be not so hard hartid, and ffor this encheson,

  Begylde and betraide by Judas fals treson;                            10

      Condempnyd[589] to deth, as thou maist se,
            Woffully araid.

  Thus nakyd am I nailid, O man, for thy sake!
  I loue thé, then loue me; why slepist thou? awake!
  Remembir my tendir hart rote for thé brake,
  With panys my vaynys constreyn[e]d to crake;                          20

          Thus wrappid all in woo,
          Whereas neuer man was so,[590]
  Entretid thus in most cruell wyse,
  Was like a lombe offerd in sacrifice,
            Woffully araid.

  Off sharpe thorne I haue worne a crowne on my hede,
  So paynyd, so straynyd, so rufull,[591] so red;
  Thus bobbid, thus robbid,[592] thus for thy loue ded,

  Explicit qd. Skelton.

[588] _Woffully araid_] From the Fairfax MS. (which once belonged
to Ralph Thoresby, and now forms part of the Additional MSS., 5465,
in the British Museum), where it occurs twice,—(fol. 76 and, less
perfectly, fol. 86); collated with a copy written in a very old hand
on the fly-leaves of _Boetius de Discip. Schol. cum notabili commento,
Daventrie_, 1496, 4to. (in the collection of the late Mr. Heber), which
has supplied several stanzas not in the Fairfax MS. It was printed from
the latter, not very correctly, by Sir John Hawkins, _Hist. of Music_,
ii. 89. I have followed the metrical arrangement of the MS. in the
_Boetius_.

[589] _condempnyd_] So sec. copy in Fairfax MS., and MS. in the
_Boetius_. First copy in F. MS. “condemp.”

[590] _Whereas neuer man was so_] MS. in the _Boetius_, “Ah _was never
man soo_.”

[591] _rufull_] MS. in the _Boetius_, “rowfully.”

[592] _bobbid ... robbid_] MS. in the _Boetius_, “bowde ... rowyd.”

[593] _Onfaynyd_] MS. in the _Boetius_, “Unfraynyd.”

[594] _deynyd_] MS. in the _Boetius_, “drynyde.”

[595] _The_] MS. in the _Boetius_, “Thes.”

[596] _Woffully araide_] Here the Fairfax MS. concludes: what follows is
given from the MS. in the _Boetius_.

[597] _Above_] MS. “I love.”




    Now synge we,[598] as we were wont,
    _Vexilla regis prodeunt_.

  The kinges baner on felde is [s]playd,
  The crosses mistry can not be nayd,
  To whom our Sauyour was betrayd,
      And for our sake;
  Thus sayth he,
  I suffre for thé,
      My deth I take.
            Now synge we, &c.

  Beholde my shankes, behold my knees,                                  10
  Beholde my hed, armes, and thees,
  Beholde of me nothyng thou sees
      But sorowe and pyne;
  Thus was I spylt,
  Man, for thy gylte,
      And not for myne.
            Now synge we, &c.

  Behold my body, how Jewes it donge
  With knots of whipcord and scourges strong;
  As stremes of a well the blode out sprong
      On euery syde;                                                    20
  The knottes were knyt,
  Ryght well made with wyt,
      They made woundes wyde.
            Now synge we, &c.

  Man, thou shalt now vnderstand,
  Of my head, bothe fote and hand,
  Are four c. and fyue thousand
      Woundes and sixty;
  Fifty and vii.
  Were tolde full euen
      Vpon my body.                                                     30
            Now synge we, &c.

  Syth I for loue bought thé so dere,
  As thou may se thy self here,
  I pray thé with a ryght good chere
      Loue me agayne,
  That it lykes me
  To suffre for thé
      Now all this payne.
            Now synge we, &c.

  Man, vnderstand now thou shall,
  In sted of drynke they gaue me gall,
  And eysell mengled therwithall,                                       40
      The Jewes fell;
  These paynes on me
  I suffred for thé
      To bryng thé fro hell.
            Now synge we, &c.

  Now for thy lyfe thou hast mysled,
  Mercy to aske be thou not adred;
  The lest drop of blode that I for thé bled
      Myght clense thé soone
  Of all the syn
  The worlde within,                                                    50
      If thou haddest doone.
            Now synge we, &c.

  I was more wrother with Judas,
  For he wold no mercy aske,
  Than I was for his trespas
      Whan he me solde;
  I was euer redy
  To graunt hym mercy,
      But he none wolde.
            Now synge we, &c.

  Lo, how I hold my armes abrode,
  Thé to receyue redy isprode![599]                                     60
  For the great loue that I to thé had
      Well may thou knowe,
  Some loue agayne
  I wolde full fayne
      Thou woldest to me shewe.
            Now synge we, &c.

  For loue I aske nothyng of thé
  But stand fast in faythe, and syn thou fle,
  And payne to lyue in honeste
      Bothe nyght and day;
  And thou shalt have blys                                              70
  That neuer shall mys
      Withouten nay.
            Now synge we, &c.

  Now, Jesu, for thy great goodnes,
  That for man suffred great hardnes,
  Saue vs fro the deuyls cruelnes,
      And to blys vs send,
  And graunt vs grace
  To se thy face
      Withouten ende.
            Now synge we, &c.

  And trowe ye so in dede,
  As ye beleve ye shal have mede.
  After better I hope ever,
  For worse was it never.

HERE AFTER FOLOWETH THE BOKE ENTYTULED WARE THE HAUKE,[604] PER SKELTON,
LAUREAT.


PROLOGUS SKELTONIDIS LAUREATI SUPER WARE THE HAWKE.

  This worke deuysed is
  For such as do amys;
  And specyally to controule
  Such as haue cure of soule,
  That be so farre abused,
  They cannot be excused
  By reason nor by law;
  But that they play the daw,
  To hawke, or els to hunt
  From the aulter[605] to the funte,                                    10
  With cry vnreuerent,
  Before the sacrament,
  Within the holy church bowndis,
  That of our faith the grounde is.
  That pryest that hawkys so,
  All grace is farre him fro;
  He semeth a sysmatyke,
  Or els an heretyke,
  For fayth in him is faynte.
  Therefore to make complaynte[606]                                     20
  Of such mysaduysed
  Parsons and dysgysed,
  This boke we haue deuysed,
  Compendiously comprysed,
  No good priest to offende,
  But suche dawes to amende,
  In hope that no man shall
  Be[607] myscontent withall.
    I shall you make relacion,
  By waye of apostrofacion,                                             30
  Vnder supportacion
  Of youre pacyent tolleracion,
  How I, Skelton Laureat,
  Deuysed and also wrate
  Vpon a lewde curate,
  A parson benyfyced,
  But nothing well aduysed:
  He shall be as now nameles,
  But he shall not be blameles,
  Nor he shal not be shameles;                                          40
  For sure he wrought amys,
  To hawke in my church of Dis.
  This fonde frantyke fauconer,[608]
  With his polutid pawtenar,[609]
  As priest vnreuerent,
  Streyght to the sacrament
  He made his hawke to fly,
  With hogeous showte and cry.
  The hye auter[610] he strypt naked;
  There on he stode, and craked;                                        50
  He shoke downe all the clothis,
  And sware horrible othes
  Before the face of God,
  By Moyses and Arons rod,
  Or that he thens yede,
  His hawke shoulde pray and fede
  Vpon a pigeons maw.
  The bloude ran downe raw
  Vpon the auter stone;
  The hawke tyrid on a bonne;                                           60
  And in the holy place
  She mutid there a chase
  Vpon my corporas face.
  Such _sacrificium laudis_
  He made with suche gambawdis.

OBSERVATE.

  His seconde hawke wexid gery,
  And was with flying wery;
  She had flowin so oft,
  That on the rode loft
  She perkyd her to rest.                                               70
  The fauconer then was prest[611],
  Came runnyng with a dow,
  And cryed, Stow, stow, stow!
  But she would not bow.
  He then, to be sure,
  Callid her with a lure.
  Her mete[612] was very crude,
  She had not wel endude;
  She was not clene ensaymed,
  She was not well reclaymed:                                           80
  But the fawconer vnfayned
  Was much more febler brayned.
  The hawke had no lyst
  To come to hys fyst;
  She loked as she had the frounce;[613]
  With that he gaue her a bounce
  Full vpon the gorge:
  I wyll not fayne nor forge;
  The hawke with that clap
  Fell downe with euyll hap.                                            90
  The church dores were sparred,
  Fast boltyd and barryd,
  Yet wyth a prety gyn
  I fortuned to come in,
  This rebell to beholde,
  Wherof I hym[614] controlde;
  But he sayde that he woulde,
  Agaynst my mynde and wyll,
  In my churche hawke styll.

CONSIDERATE.

  On Sainct John decollacion                                           100
  He hawked on this facion,
  _Tempore vesperarum,_
  _Sed non secundum Sarum_,
  But lyke a Marche harum,
  His braynes were so _parum_.
  He sayde he would not let
  His houndis for to fet,
  To hunte there by lyberte
  In the dyspyte of me,
  And to halow there the fox:                                          110
  Downe went my offerynge box,
  Boke, bell, and candyll,
  All that he myght handyll;
  Cros, staffe, lectryne, and banner,
  Fell downe on this manner.

DELIBERATE.

  With, troll, cytrace, and trouy,
  They ranged, hankin bouy,
  My churche all aboute.
  This fawconer then[615] gan showte,
  These be my gospellers,                                              120
  These be my pystillers,
  These be my querysters
  To helpe me to synge,
  My hawkes to mattens rynge.
  In this priestly gydynge
  His hawke then flew vppon
  The rode with Mary and John.
  Delt he not lyke a fon?
  Delt he not lyke a daw?
  Or els is this Goddes law,                                           130
  Decrees or decretals,
  Or holy sinodals,
  Or els prouincials,
  Thus within the wals
  Of holy church to deale,
  Thus to rynge a peale
  With his hawkis bels?
  Dowtles such losels
  Make the churche to be
  In smale auctoryte:                                                  140
  A curate in speciall
  To snappar and to fall
  Into this open cryme;
  To loke on this were tyme.

VIGILATE.

  But who so that lokys
  In the officiallis bokis,
  Ther he[616] may se and reed
  That this is matter indeed.
  How be it, mayden Meed
  Made theym to be agreed,                                             150
  And so the Scrybe was feed,
  And the Pharasay
  Than durst nothing say,
  But let the matter slyp,
  And made truth to trip;
  And of the spiritual law
  They made but a gewgaw,
  And toke it out in drynke,
  And this the cause doth shrynke:
  The church is thus abused,                                           160
  Reproched and pollutyd;
  Correccion hath no[617] place,
  And all for lacke of grace.

DEPLORATE.

  Loke now in _Exodi_,
  And _de arca Domini_,
  With _Regum_ by and by;
  The Bybyll wyll not ly;
  How the Temple was kept,
  How the Temple was swept,
  Where _sanguis taurorum,_                                            170
  _Aut sanguis vitulorum_,
  Was offryd within the wallis,
  After ceremoniallis;
  When it was poluted,
  Sentence was executed,
  By wey of expiacion,
  For reconciliacion.[618]

DIVINITATE.[619]

  Then muche more, by the rode,
  Where Christis precious blode
  Dayly offred is,                                                     180
  To be poluted this;
  And that he wyshed withall
  That the dowues donge downe might fal
  Into my chalis at mas,
  When consecrated was
  The blessed sacrament:
  O prieest vnreuerent!
  He sayde that he woulde hunt
  From the aulter to the funt.

REFORMATE.

  Of no tyrande I rede,                                                190
  That so farre dyd excede;
  Neyther yet Dioclesyan,
  Nor yet Domisian,
  Nor yet[620] croked Cacus,
  Nor yet dronken Bacus;[621]
  Nother Olibrius,
  Nor Dionisyus;
  Nother Phalary,
  Rehersed in Valery;
  Nor Sardanapall,                                                     200
  Vnhappiest of all;
  Nor Nero the worst,
  Nor Clawdius the curst;
  Nor yet Egeas,
  Nor yet Syr Pherumbras;
  Nother Zorobabell,
  Nor cruel Jesabell;
  Nor yet Tarquinius,
  Whom Tytus Liuius
  In wrytynge doth enroll;                                             210
  I haue red them poll by poll;
  The story of Arystobell,
  And of Constantinopell,[622]
  Whiche citye miscreantys wan,
  And slew many a Christen man;
  Yet the Sowden, nor the Turke,
  Wrought neuer suche a worke,
  For to let theyr hawkes fly
  In the Church of Saint Sophy;
  With much matter more,                                               220
  That I kepe in store.

PENSITATE.

  Then in a tabull playne
  I wroute a verse or twayne,
  Whereat he made dysdayne:
  The pekysh parsons brayne
  Cowde not rech nor attayne
  What the sentence ment;
  He sayde, for a crokid intent
  The wordes were paruerted:
  And this he ouerthwarted.                                            230
  Of the which proces
  Ye may know more expres,
  If it please you to loke
  In the resydew of this boke.

_Here after followeth the tabull._

  Loke on this tabull,
  Whether thou art abull
  To rede or to spell
  What these verses tell.

    _Sicculo lutueris est colo būraarā[623]_
  _Nixphedras uisarum caniuter tuntantes[624]_
  _Raterplas Natābrian[625] umsudus itnugenus._
  _18. 10. 2. 11. 19. 4. 13. 3. 3. 1. tēualet.[626]_
  _Chartula stet, precor, hæc nullo[627] temeranda petulco:_
  _Hos rapiet numeros non homo, sed mala bos._
  _Ex parte rem chartæ adverte aperte, pone Musam Arethusam hanc._

  Whereto should I rehers
  The sentence of my vers?                                             240
  In them be no scholys
  For braynsycke frantycke folys:
  _Construas hoc_,
  _Domine_ Dawcocke!
      Ware the hawke!
  Maister _sophista_,
  Ye _simplex syllogista_,
  Ye[628] deuelysh _dogmatista_,
  Your hawke on your fista,
  To hawke when you[629] lista                                         250
  _In ecclesia ista_,
  _Domine concupisti_,[630]
  With thy hawke on thy fisty?
  _Nunquid sic dixisti?_
  _Nunquid sic fecisti?_
  _Sed ubi hoc legisti_
  _Aut unde hoc_,
  Doctor Dawcocke?
      Ware the hawke!
  Doctor _Dialetica_,[631]                                             260
  Where fynde you in _Hypothetica_,
  Or in _Categoria_,
  _Latina sive Dorica_,
  To vse your hawkys _forica_
  _In propitiatorio_,
  _Tanquam diversorio?_
  _Unde hoc_,
  _Domine_ Dawcocke?
      Ware the hawke!
  Saye to me, Jacke Harys,                                             270
  _Quare aucuparis_
  _Ad sacramentum altaris?_
  For no reuerens[632] thou sparys
  To shake my pygeons federis
  _Super arcam fœderis_:
  _Unde hoc_,
  Doctor Dawcocke?
      Ware the hawke!
  Sir _Dominus vobiscum_,
  _Per[633] aucupium_                                                  280
  Ye made your hawke to cum
  _Desuper candelabrum_
  _Christi crucifixi_
  To fede vpon your fisty:
  _Dic, inimice crucis Christi_,
  _Ubi didicisti_
  _Facere hoc_,

[604] _Ware the Hauke_] From the ed. by Kynge and Marche of _Certaine
bokes compyled by mayster Skelton_, n. d., collated with the same work,
ed. Day, n. d., and ed. Lant, n. d., and with Marshe’s ed. of Skelton’s
_Workes_, 1568.

[605] _aulter_] Here Lant’s ed. has “auter.” (In the spelling of this
word the eds. are not consistent; see vv. 49, 59, 189.)

[606] _complaynte_] So other eds. Ed. of Kynge and Marche, “complaunt.”

[607] _Be_] So other eds. Ed. of Kynge and Marche, “By.”

[608] _fauconer_] So other eds. Ed. of Kynge and Marche, and of Lant,
“fouconer.”

[609] _pawtenar_] Eds. of Day, and Marshe, “pawtner.”

[610] _auter_] Eds. of Day, and Marshe, “aulter:” see note, ante, p. 155.

[611] _prest_] So other eds. Ed. of Kynge and Marche, and of Day,
“priest.”

[612] _mete_] So Lant’s ed. Ed. of Kynge and Marche, “mere.” Other eds.
“meate.”

[613] _frounce_] So Lant’s ed. Other eds. “fronnce” and “fronce.”

[614] _I hym_] So Lant’s ed. Other eds. “him I.”

[615] _then_] Not in eds. of Day, and Marshe.

[616] _he_] Marshe’s ed. “her.”

[620] _Nor yet_] Lant’s ed. “Nother.”

[621] _Bacus_] Marshe’s ed. “Baccus.”

[622] _Constantinopell_] Marshe’s ed. “Constantinobel.”

[623] _būraarā_] In Day’s ed. the final letter of this word being blurred
looks like a _d_; and Marshe’s ed. has “bunraard.” The meaning of this
“tabull playne” is quite beyond my comprehension.

[624] _tuntantes_] Marshe’s ed. “tauntantes.”

[625] _Natābrian_] Eds. of Day, and Marshe, “Natanbrian.” The Editor of
1736 prints “_Natanbrianum sudus_.”

[627] _nullo_] Eds. of Day, and Marshe, “uello.”

[636] _animalia_] Eds. of Kynge and Marche, and of Lant, (in which
impressions only this line is found), “aīlia.”

[637] _Walys_] Eds. of Day, and Marshe, “Wales,” and in the next line
“tales.”

[638] _bestialis_] Day’s ed. “bestia.” Marshe’s ed. “bestis.”

  Adam Vddersall,[654]
  _Alias dictus_ Adam all
      a knaue, his
  Epitaph foloweth deuoutly;
  He was somtime the holy
      Baillyue of Dis.

            Of Dis
  _Adam degebat:_
  _dum vixit, falsa gerebat,_
  _Namque extorquebat_
  _quicquid nativus habebat,_
  _Aut liber natus; rapidus[655]_
  _lupus inde vocatus:_
  _Ecclesiamque satus_
  _de Belial iste Pilatus_
  _Sub pede calcatus_
  _violavit, nunc violatus:_                                            10
  _Perfidus, iratus,_
  _numquam fuit ille beatus:_
  _Uddersall stratus_

  _maledictis jam laceratus:_
  _Dis,[657] tibi bacchatus_
  _ballivus prædominatus:_
  _Hic fuit ingratus,_
  _porcus velut insatiatus,_                                            20
  _Pinguis, crassatus;_

  _Jam scio mortuus est,_
  _Et jacet hic_, like a best.
      _Anima ejus_
      _De malo in pejus.[659] Amen._                                    30
  _De Dis hæc semper erit camena,_
  _Adam Uddersall sit anathema!_

  _Auctore Skelton, rectore de Dis._

_Finis, &c. Apud Trumpinton scriptum[660] per Curatum ejusdem, quinto die
Januarii Anno Domini, secundum computat. Angliæ, MDVII._

_Adam, Adam, ubi es?_ Genesis. Re. _Ubi nulla requies, ubi nullus ordo,
sed sempiternus horror inhabitat._ Job.

[639] _decollate_] Eds. “decolare.”

[640] _haud_] Eds. “hod.”

[641] _quondam_] Marshe’s ed. “quandam.”

[642] _intra_] Eds. “infra.”

[643] _tua_] Eds. “sua.”

[644] _Idem, &c._] These lines follow _Ware the Hawk_ in all the eds.

[645] _valent_] Eds. “volent.”

[646] _Epithaphe, &c._] From Marshe’s ed. of Skelton’s _Workes_, 1568.

[647] _all_] Ed. “ali.:” but compare p. 171.

[648] _multinominis_] Ed. “maltimoniis.”

[649] _populo_] The correction of the Rev. J. Mitford. Ed. “populus.”

[650] _que Acheronta, &c. ... que dicax, &c._] Perhaps these passages
ought to be arranged thus for the sake of the rhyme;

  _“que Acheronta boando_
  _tonaret. Nunquam sincere,” &c._
  ...
  _“que dicax mendax—_
  _que, fuere Et mores tales,” &c._

But from the rest of the poem it seems that Skelton intended each
hexameter to be cut only into two parts.

[651] _socios_] Ed. “socias.”

[652] _caput aut ovis_] Ed. “caput caput.” I give the conjectural reading
of the Rev. J. Mitford. The rhyme suggests (but the metre will not allow)
“bidentis.”

[653] _incola_] Ed. “Nicolas.”

[654] _Vddersall, &c._] Ed. “Vddersale:” but compare vv. 13, 32. In
this passage I have adopted the arrangement proposed by the Rev. J.
Mitford.—Ed. thus;

  “Adam Vddersale. alias dictus
  Adam all. a knaue his Epitaph.
  Foloweth deuoutly,
  He was somtime the holy
  baillyue of dis.”

[655] _rapidus_] The Rev. J. Mitford conjectures, “rabidus;” but
_rapidus_ is frequently used in the same sense.

[656] _benedictis_] Ed. “Benedictus;” and in the next line but one,
“Maledictus.”

[657] _Dis, tibi, &c._] The emendation of the Rev. J. Mitford: compare
above, “Baillyue of Dis.”—Ed.

  “Sis _tibi baccatus_
  Balians _prædominatus_.”

[658] _sit_] Ed. “fit.”

[659] _pejus_] Ed. “peuis.”

[660] _scriptum_] Ed. “scripter.”




  _Diligo rustincum[661] cum portant bis duo quointum,_
    _Et cantant delos est mihi dulce melos._
              1. _Canticum dolorosum._

[661] _Diligo rustincum, &c._] This and the following piece are from
Marshe’s ed. of Skelton’s _Workes_, 1568. In that collection the present
couplet is twice printed: “_rustincum_” is the reading of the first copy,
“_rusticum_” (which the metre will not admit) of the second: the first
copy has “_quonintum_,” the second “_quointum_;” the Editor of 1736 gave
“_quantum_.” See notes for the conjectures of the Rev. J. Mitford on this
enigma. “_Canticum dolorosum_” is probably part of the title of the next
piece.




LAMENTATIO URBIS NORVICEN.


  _O lacrymosa lues nimis, O quam flebile fatum!_
    _Ignibus exosis, urbs veneranda, ruis;_
  _Fulmina sive Jovis sive ultima fata vocabant,_
    _vulcani rapidis ignibus ipsa peris._
  _Ah[662] decus, ah patriæ specie pulcherrima dudum!_
    _Urbs Norvicensis labitur[663] in cineres._
  _Urbs, tibi quid referam? breviter tibi pauca reponam:_
    _Prospera rara[664] manent, utere sorte tua;_
  _Perpetuum mortale nihil, sors omnia versat:_
    _Urbs miseranda, vale! sors miseranda tua est._                     10

  Skelton.[665]

[662] _Ah ... ah_] Ed. “Au ... au.”

[663] _labitur_] Ed. “labitar.”

[664] _rara_] Ed. “raro.”

[665] _Skelton_] Ed. “inifiranda _Skelton_:” the former word perhaps
having been inserted by some mistake of the printer, whose eye had caught
“miseranda” in the preceding line.




IN BEDEL, QUONDAM BELIAL INCARNATUM, DEVOTUM EPITAPHIUM.


  _Ismal, ecce, Bedel, non mel, sed fel, sibi des el![666]_
    _Perfidus Achitophel, luridus atque lorell;_
  _Nunc olet iste Jebal,[667] Nabal. S. Nabal, ecce, ribaldus!_
    _Omnibus exosus atque perosus erat;_
  _In plateaque cadens animam spiravit oleto:_
    _Presbyteros odiens sic sine mente ruit._
  _Discite vos omnes quid sit violare sacratos_
    _Presbyteros, quia sic corruit iste canis._
  _Cocytus cui si detur[668] per Tartara totus,_
    _Sit, peto, promotus Cerberus huncque voret._                       10
  _At mage sancta tamen mea Musa precabitur[669] atros_
    _Hos lemuresque eat sic Bedel ad superos;_
  _Non eat, immo ruat, non scandat, sed mage tendat,_
    _Inque caput præceps mox Acheronta petat._

  _Bedel. Quanta malignatus est inimicus in sancto!_[670]

  Psa. 73.

[666] _des el_] The Rev. J. Mitford proposes “dorell.”

[667] _Jebal_] Qy. “Jabel?” but I do not understand the line.

[668] _si detur_] So the Rev. J. Mitford reads. Ed. “sic petus.”

[669] _precabitur_] Ed. “precabiturum.”

[670] _sancto_] Ed. “sāctā.”




  _Mortuus est asinus,_
  _Qui pinxit mulum:[671]_
  _Hic jacet barbarus_;
  The deuill kys his _culum_! _Amen._

_Hanc volo transcribas, transcriptam moxque remittas Pagellam; quia sunt
qui mea scripta sciunt._

[671] _pinxit mulum_] Corrected by the Rev. J. Mitford. Ed. “vixit
multum.” The progress of the error was evidently—pinxit, _vinxit_,
_vixit_. See notes.




  _Redde_   { _Igitur quia sunt qui mala cuncta fremunt,[672]_
            { _Igitur quia sunt qui bona cuncta premunt._
              _Nec tamen expaveo de fatuo labio,_
              _Nec multum paveo de stolido[673] rabulo._

[672] _fremunt ... premunt_] So Editor of 1736. Ed. “frenuitur,”
“prenuitur.”

[673] _stolido_] Ed. “scolido.”




  _Salve plus[674] decies quam[675] sunt momenta dierum!_
  _Quot generum species,[676] quot res, quot nomina rerum,_
  _Quot prati[677] flores, quot sunt et[678] in orbe colores,_
  _Quot pisces, quot aves, quot sunt et[679] in æquore naves,_
  _Quot volucrum pennæ, quot sunt tormenta gehennæ,_
  _Quot cœli stellæ, quot sunt et[680] in orbe puellæ,_
  _Quot sancti Romæ, quot sunt miracula Thomæ,_
  _Quot sunt virtutes, tantas tibi[681] mitto salutes._

[674] _Salve plus, &c._] From Marshe’s ed. of Skelton’s _Workes_, 1568,
(where it is printed on the reverse of the title-page), collated with a
copy in Additional MSS. Brit. Mus. (4787, fol. 224), which is headed “Ex
Jo. Skeltono Poeta Laureato.”

[675] _quam_] So MS. In Marshe’s ed. a contraction, which the Editor of
1736 resolved into “quot.”

[676] _generum species_] MS. “_species generum_.”

[677] _prati_] MS. “pratis.”

[678] _et_] Not in Marshe’s ed.

[679] _et_] Not in Marshe’s ed.

[680] _et_] Not in Marshe’s ed.

[681] _tantas tibi_] So MS. Marshe’s ed. “tot vobis;” but compare v. 1.
“_Salve_,” &c.

SKELTON LAUREATE AGAINST THE SCOTTES.[699]


  Agaynst the prowde Scottes clatterynge,
  That neuer wyll leaue theyr tratlynge:
  Wan they the felde, and lost theyr kynge?
  They may well say, fye on that wynnynge!

  Lo, these fonde sottes
  And tratlynge Scottes,
  How thei are blynde
  In theyr owne mynde,
  And wyll not know
  Theyr ouerthrow                                                       10
  At Branxton[700] more!
  They are so stowre,
  So frantyke mad,
  They say they had
  And wan the felde
  With spere and shelde:
  That is as trew
  As blacke is blew
  And grene is gray.
  What euer they say,                                                   20
  Jemmy is ded
  And closed in led,
  That was theyr owne kynge:
  Fy on that wynnynge!
    At Floddon[701] hyllys
  Our bowys, our byllys,
  Slewe all the floure
  Of theyr honoure.
  Are not[702] these Scottys
  Folys and sottys,                                                     30
  Suche boste to make,
  To prate and crake,
  To face, to brace,
  All voyde of grace,
  So prowde of hart,
  So ouerthwart,
  So out of frame,
  So voyde of shame,
  As it is enrolde,
  Wrytten and tolde                                                     40
  Within this quayre?
  Who lyst to[703] repayre,
  And therin reed,
  Shall fynde indeed
  A mad rekenynge,
  Consyderynge al thynge,
  That the Scottis may synge[704]
  Fy on the wynnynge!

_When the Scotte lyued._

  Joly Jemmy, ye scorneful Scot,
  Is it come vnto your lot                                              50
  A solempne sumner for to be?
  It greyth nought for your degre
  Our kynge of Englande for to syght,[705]
  Your souerayne lord, our prynce of might:
  Ye for to sende such a citacion,
  It shameth all your noughty nacion,
  In comparyson but kynge Koppynge
  Vnto our prince, annoynted kynge.
  Ye play Hob Lobbyn of Lowdean;
  Ye shew ryght well what good ye can;                                  60
  Ye may be lorde of Locrian,—
  Chryst sence[706] you with a frying pan!—
  Of Edingborrow and Saint Ionis towne:
  Adieu, syr sumner, cast of youre crowne!

_When the Scot was slayne._

  Continually I shall remember
  The mery moneth of September,
  With the ix[707] daye of the same,
  For then began our myrth and game;
  So that now I haue deuysed,
  And in my minde I haue comprysed,                                     70
  Of the prowde Scot, kynge Jemmy,
  To wryte some lyttle tragedy,
  For no maner consyderacion
  Of any sorowful lamentacion,
  But for the special consolacion
  Of all our royall Englysh nacion.
    Melpomone,[708] O Muse tragediall,
  Vnto your grace for grace now I call,
  To guyde my pen and my pen to enbybe!
  Illumyn me, your poete and your scrybe,                               80
  That with myxture of aloes and bytter gall
  I may compounde confectures for a cordiall,
  To angre the Scottes and Irysh keteringes withall,
  That late were discomfect with battayle marcyall.
    Thalia, my Muse, for you also call I,
  To touche them with tauntes of your armony,
  A medley to make of myrth with sadnes,
  The hartes of England to comfort with gladnes:
  And now to begyn I wyll me adres,
  To you rehersynge the somme of my proces.                             90
    Kynge Jamy, Jemmy, Jocky my jo,[709]
  Ye[710] summond our kynge,—why dyd ye so?
  To you nothing it dyd accorde
  To summon our kynge, your soueraygne lord.
  A kyng, a sumner![711] it was great wonder:
  Know ye not suger and salt asonder?
  Your sumner to saucy, to malapert,
  Your harrold in armes not yet halfe experte.
  Ye thought ye dyd yet valyauntly,
  Not worth thre skyppes of a pye:                                     100
  Syr skyrgalyard, ye were so skyt,
  Your wyll than ran before your wyt.
    Your lege ye layd and your aly
  Your frantick fable not worth a fly,
  Frenche kynge, or one or other;
  Regarded ye[712] should your lord, your brother.
  Trowid ye, Syr Jemy, his nobul grace
  From you, Syr Scot, would turne his face?
  With, Gup, Syr Scot of Galawey!
  Now is your pryde fall to decay.                                     110
  Male vryd was your fals entent
  For to offende your presydent,
  Your souerayne lord most reuerent,
  Your lord, your brother, and your regent.
    In him is fygured Melchisedec,
  And ye were disloyall Amalec.
  He is our noble Scipione,[713]
  Annoynted kynge; and ye were none,
  Thoughe ye vntruly your father haue slayne.
  His tytle is true in Fraunce to raygne;                              120
  And ye, proud Scot, Dunde, Dunbar,
  Pardy, ye were his homager,
  And suter to his parliament:
  For your vntruth now ar ye shent.
  Ye bare yourselfe somwhat to bold,
  Therfore ye lost your copyehold;
  Ye were bonde tenent to his estate;
  Lost is your game, ye are checkmate.
    Vnto the castell of Norram,
  I vnderstande, to sone ye came.                                      130
  At Branxston more and Flodden hylles,
  Our Englysh bowes, our Englysh bylles,
  Agaynst you gaue so sharpe a shower,
  That of Scotland ye lost the flower.
  The Whyte Lyon, there rampaunt of moode,
  He ragyd and rent out your hart bloode;
  He the Whyte, and ye[714] the Red,
  The Whyte there slew the Red starke ded.
  Thus for your guerdon quyt ar ye,
  Thanked be God in Trinite,                                           140
  And swete Sainct George, our ladies knyght!
  Your eye is out; adew, good nyght!
    Ye were starke mad to make a fray,
  His grace beyng out of the way:
  But, by the power and might of God,
  For your owne[715] tayle ye made a rod.
  Ye wanted wit, syr, at a worde;
  Ye lost your spurres, ye lost your sworde.
  Ye myght haue buskyd you to Huntley bankys;
  Your pryde was peuysh to play such prankys:                          150
  Your pouerte coude not attayne
  With our kynge royal war to mayntayne.
    Of the kyng of Nauerne ye might take heed,
  Vngraciously how he doth speed:
  In[716] double delynge so he did dreme,
  That he is kynge without a reme;
  And, for example ye[717] would none take,
  Experiens hath brought you in suche a brake.
  Your welth, your ioy, your sport, your play,
  Your bragynge bost, your royal aray,                                 160
  Your beard so brym as bore at bay,
  Your Seuen Systers, that gun so gay,
  All haue ye lost and cast away.
  Thus fortune hath tourned you, I dare well saye,
  Now from a kynge to a clot of clay:
  Out of your[718] robes ye were shaked,
  And wretchedly ye lay starke naked.[719]
  For lacke of grace hard was your hap:
  The Popes curse[720] gaue you that clap.
    Of the out yles the roughe foted Scottes,                          170
  We haue well eased them of the bottes:
  The rude ranke Scottes, lyke dronken dranes,
  At Englysh bowes haue fetched theyr banes.
  It is not fytting[721] in tower and towne
  A sumner[722] to were a kynges crowne:
  Fortune on you therfore did frowne;
  Ye were to hye, ye are cast downe.
  Syr sumner, now where is your crowne?
  Cast of your crowne, cast vp your crowne!
  Syr sumner, now ye haue lost your crowne.                            180

VNTO DIUERS PEOPLE THAT REMORD THIS[724] RYMYNGE AGAYNST THE SCOT JEMMY.


  I am now constrayned,
  With wordes nothynge fayned,

  For some peoples[725] sake
  That lyst for to iangyll
  And waywardly to wrangyll
  Agaynst this my makynge,

  A subtyll sysmatyke,
  Ryght nere an heretyke,
  Of grace out of the state,
  And died excomunycate.                                                30

THE BOKE OF THREE FOOLES,[759] M. SKELTON, POETE LAUREATE, GAUE TO MY
LORD CARDYNALL.


THE FYRST FOOLE.

  The man that doth wed a wyfe
    For her goodes and her rychesse,
  And not for lygnage femynatyfe,
    Procureth doloure and dystresse,
    With infynyte payne and heuynesse;
  For she wyll do hym moche sorowe,
  Bothe at euyn and at morowe.

THE SECONDE FOOLE.

  The dartes ryght cursed of Enuye
    Hath rayned sythe the worlde began,
  Whiche bryngeth man euydently
    Into the bondes of Sathan;
    Wherfore he is a dyscrete man
  That can eschewe that euyll synne
  Where body and soule is lost in.

THE THYRD FOOLE.

  Dyuers by voluptuousnes
    Of women, the which be present,
  Be brought into full great dystres,
    Forgettyng vertues excellent
    Of God, the whych is permanent,
  And suffreth themselfe to be bounde
  In cordes, as it were a hounde.

Come hyther, and take this boke, and rede therein for your lernyng with
clere iyen, and loke in this boke, that sheweth you folysh fooles without
wyt or vnderstanding. Pecunyous fooles, that bee auaryce, and for to haue
good tyme and to lyue meryly, weddeth these olde wyddred women, whych
hath sackes full of nobles, claryfye here your syghte, and ye shal know
what goodnes commeth therby, and what joye and gladnes. Some there be
that habandoneth themselfe for to gather togyther the donge that yssueth
oute of theyr asses arse, for to fynde euermore grese: it is grete foly
trulye; but yet the yonge man is more folyssher the whiche weddeth an
olde wyfe, for to haue her golde and syluer. I say that he is a great
foole that taketh anne olde wyfe for her goodes, and is much to blame.

They the whiche do so procureth all trybulations; for with her he shall
neither haue ioy, recreacion, nor rest. He noryssheth stryfes and greate
debates, thoughte, payne, anguyshe, and melancoly: and yf he wolde
accomplysshe the workes of maryage, hee may not, for shee is so debylyte,
colde, vnpropyce, vnnaturall, and vndyscurrente, for the coldenes that
is in her. The husbande of this olde wyfe hath none esperaunce to haue
lygnage by her, for he neuer loued her. The man is a verye foole to make
his demoraunce vpon such an olde wife. Whan he thinketh somtime vpon such
thynges, he leseth his naturall wit, in cursynge hymselfe more then a m.
tymes with the golde and the syluer, and the cursed hasarde of Fortune.
And when he seeth his poore lyfe in suche dystresse, his hert is all
oppressed with melancoly and dolour: but whan the vnhappye man seeth
that it is force, and that hee is constrayned[760] to haue pacience, he
putteth his cure to draw to hym the money of the olde wyddred woman in
makyng to her glade chere. And whan hee hath the money and the bagge with
nobles, God knoweth what chere he maketh, wythoute thynkinge on them
that gathered[761] it. And when he hath spente al, he is more vnhappyer
then hee was before. Yf that the foole be vnhappye, it is well ryghte,
for hee hath wedded auaryce, mother of all euylles: yf hee had taken a
wyfe that had ben fayre and yonge, after his complection, he had not
fallen into so great an inconuenience. It is wryten in auncient bokes,
that hee whiche weddeth a wyfe by auaryce, and not for to haue lygnage,
hath no cure of the honestie of matrymonye, and thynketh full euyll on
his conscience. The vnyon of maryage is[762] decayed; for, vnder the
coloure of good and loyall maryage, is wedded auaryce, as we se euery day
by experience through the world. And one wil haue a wife, and that hee
marke his to be demaunded in maryage, they will enquyre of his ryches and
conninge. And on the other syde he wyl demaunde great goodes with her,
to norysshe her with: for and her father and mother and frendes haue no
greate ryches, he wyll not of her; but and she be ryche, hee demaundeth
none other thynge. It is written, that one were better haue his house in
deserte, whereas no mencion shoulde be of hym, thenne to bide with suche
wyues, for they be replete with all cursednes. And the pore foole breketh
his hearte; he loseth his soule, and corrompeth his body. He selleth
his youth vnto the olde wife that weddeth her for auaryce, and hath but
noyse and discention, in vsyng his lyfe thus in synne. Consydre, you
fooles, what seruytude ye put your self in, when ye wedde such wyues. I
pray you be chast, if that ye wyl lyue without vnhap. My frends, whiche
be not in that bande, put you not therin, and yee shalbe well happy.
Notwithstanding, I defende you not to mary, but I exhorte you to take
a wyfe that ye may haue progeny by, and solace bodely and gostly, and
thereby to wyn the ioyes of Paradyse.


OF ENUYE, THE SECONDE FOOLE.

Approche, you folyshe enuyous, the which can say no good by them that
ye hate, come and se in this booke youre peruerse and euyll condycions.
O Enuy, that deuoureth the condycions of men, and dyssypers of honour!
Thou makest to haue rauisshynge heartes famyshed; thou brennest the
desyres, and sleeth the soule in the ende; thou engendrest the darte
enuyronned with mischefe, that whiche traueyleth diuers folkes. Cursed
foole, howe haste thou thy heart so replete with cruelte? for, if I haue
temporall goodes, thou wilte haue enuye therat; or, if that I can worke
well, and that I apply mee vnto dyuers thynges the whiche be honest,
or if that I haue castels, landes, and tenementes, or if that I am
exalted vnto honoure by my science, or won it by my hardynes truely and
iustlye, or if that I am beloued of dyuers persons whiche reclaymeth mee
good and vertuous and of a noble courage, thou wylt vilepende me with
thy wordes: thou wottest neuer in what maner thou mayst adnychell mine
honour. Thy malicious hert is hurt with a mortall wounde, in such wise
that thou haste no ioye nor solace in this world, for the darte of Enuye
perceth thy herte lyke a spere. Thou hast wylde lycoure, the whiche
maketh all thy stomacke to be on a flambe. There is no medicyne that
maye hele thy mortall wounde. I, beynge in a place where as myne honoure
was magnyfyed, thoughte for to haue taken alyaunce with an odyfferaunt
floure, but all sodaynely I was smyten with a darte of Enuye behinde my
backe, wherthroughe all tho that were on my partye turned theyr backes
vpon me, for to agree to one of Venus dissolate seruauntes, procedynge
frome a hearte enuenymed with enuye. Wherfore I shall specyfye vnto you
the condycyons of the enuyous. Who that holdeth hym of the subgectes of
Enuye, she constytueth to deuoure and byte euery bodye; gyuynge vnhappes
and myseryes vnto her seruauntes. Suche folkes doth the innocente a
thousande wronges. They be replenysshed with so many treasons, that they
can not slepe in theyr beddes; they haue no swete cantycles nor songes.
They haue theyr tonges honyed with swete words vnder the coloure of loue;
they be lene, and infecte of rygoure these enuyous, more bytterer thenne
the gall of the fyshe glauca, wyth theyr eyen beholdinge a trauers, of
stomackes chaufed syntillously, and without their[763] mouthes, as the
vyne that is newe cut, they be enuyroned with rage and greate anguysshe,
beholdynge euermore to destroy some body. Conceyue the history of Joseph
in your myndes, the which had vii. brethren, that were enuyous against
him which was the yongeste, and solde hym vnto the marchauntes of Egypte
by enuy, and betrayed him; the which were delybered of a longe time to
haue destroyed him. These enuious neuer laughe but whan some good man
hath domage vpon the see or lande; or at the disfortune of some body,
he drynketh his bloud as milke. Notwithstandinge his heart is euer
enbraced with enuy, and as longe as he lyueth it shall gnawe his hert.
Hee resembleth vnto Ethna whiche brenneth alwayes. As of Romulus, and
Remus his brother, the whiche Romulus edefyed first Rome, and gaue it to
name Rome, after his owne name. Neuertheles they were pastours, for they
establyshed lawes in the citie. And Romulus punished euerye body egally.
He dyd instytute lymittes or markes aboute the citie, and ordeyned that
he that passed the lymyttes shuld be put to death. His brother passed
them, wherfore he was put vnto death incontinente in the same place. Wee
rede also how Cayme slewe his owne brother by enuye. Haue we not ensample
semblablye of Atreus, of whom his brother occupyed the parke, howe well
that they were in the realme stronge and puyssaunte, for to defende them?
It was Thesius[764] that expulsed his brother oute of the realme by enuy,
and was called agayne bycause that he had taken the parke, and fynally
was banyshed, and by enuye and vnder the colour of peace he was sent for.
And when hee was commen vnto a feast, he made his two children for to
be rested, and made theim[765] to drynke their bloude. O what horroure
was it to see his twoo children dye that were so dyscrete! In lykewise
Ethiocles by his brethren receyued great enormyties by that cursed Enuye.
O thou prudent man, if thou wilt be discrete, good, and wise, flye from
Enuy, and thou shalt finde thy selfe sounde of body and soule!


OF THE VOLUPTUOUSNES CORPORALL, THE THIRD FOOLE.

Ryghte heartely I beseche you, folysshe and lecherous people, that it
will please you for to come and make a litell collacion in this booke;
and if there be any thinge that I can do for you, I am all yours both
body and goodes; for truelye I haue an ardaunte desyre to doo you some
meditorious[766] dede, bicause that I haue euer frequented your seruyce.

Nowe herken what I haue found you, cautellous women. They that the
pappes be sene all naked, their heyre combed and trussed in dyuers
places merueylously, be vnreasonable fooles, for they dresse theim like
voluptuous harlottes, that make their heyre to appere at theyr browes,
yalowe as fine golde, made in lytel tresses for to drawe yonge folke to
theyr loue. Some, for to haue their goodes, presenteth to theim their
beddes for to take their carnall desires; and after that they haue taken
all their disportes, they pill theim as an onion. The other, for to haue
their plesures mondayne, cheseth theim that she loueth[767] best, and
maketh sygnyfyaunce to theim, sayeng that she is anamoured on theim.
Thou art a verye idyot so to abandone thy selfe vnto the vyle synne of
lecherye, for thou lettest thy selfe be wrapped therein, lyke as a calfe
or a shepe is bounde in a corde, in suche wise that ye can not vnbynde
youre selfe. O foole, haue aspecte vnto that whiche thou commyttest! for
thou puttest thy poore soule in great daunger of damnation eternall; thou
puttest thy goodes, thyne vnderstandinge, and thy ioy, vnto dolorous
perdicion: and for all that yee bee in your wor[l]dly pleasures, yet it
is mengled with dystres or with mysery, greate thoughte or melancoly.
I requyre thee, leue thy wor[l]dlye pleasures, that endureth no lenger
then the grasse of the feelde. Yf you haue ioye one only momente, thou
shalt haue twayne of sorow for it. Wee rede of Sardanapalus, that for
his lecherye and lybidinosite fell into hell; the whiche put him selfe
in the guise of a poore woman: his men, seinge hym so obstinate in that
vile sinne, slewe him, and so fynished hee his dayes for folowinge of his
pleasaunce mondayne. The soueraigne Creatour was more puyssante thenne
this wretched sinner. Let vs not apply our selfe therto, sith that hee
punysheth sinners so asprely; but with all our hertes enforce we our
selfe for to resist againste that vyle and abhomynable sinne of lechery,
the whiche is so full of enfeccion and bytternes, for it distayneth the
soule of man. Fle frome the foolisshe women, that pylleth the louers vnto
the harde bones, and you shal be beloued of God and also of the worlde.

  Of all pure clennesse virgynall,
  That our Sauyour bare,
  Whiche vs redemed from care.

[Sidenote: Convenio vos, O Ariani, Juliano apostata execrabiliores, &c.]

    I saye, thou madde Marche hare,
  I wondre howe ye dare
  Open your ianglyng iawes,
  To preche in any clawes,
  Lyke pratynge poppyng dawes,
  Agaynst her excellence,                                               40
  Agaynst her reuerence,
  Agaynst her preemynence,
  Agaynst her magnifycence,
  That neuer dyde offence.

[Sidenote: Convenio vos, O spurcissimi, O vilissimi, O nequissimi
obtrectatores matris Christi, &c.]

    Ye heretykes recrayed,
  Wotte ye what ye sayed
  Of Mary, mother and mayed?
  With baudrie at her ye brayed;
  With baudy wordes vnmete
  Your tonges were to flete;                                            50
  Your sermon was nat swete;
  Ye were nothyng discrete;
  Ye were in a dronken hete.
  Lyke heretykes confettred,

[Sidenote: Convenio vos, O insensati literarum professores, &c.]

  Ye count your selfe wele lettred:
  Your lernyng is starke nought,
  For shamefully ye haue wrought,
  And to shame your selfe haue brought.

[Sidenote: Convenio vos, O Jebusæi, O Judæi, O Cananæi, O Pharisæi, &c.]

    Bycause ye her mysnamed,
  And wolde haue her defamed,                                           60
  Your madnesse she attamed;
  For ye were worldly shamed,
  At Poules crosse openly,
  All men can testifye;

[Sidenote: Non vacat, O contemptores Mariani, non vacat, inquam, quod
digna factis recepistis in deiparæ virginis conceptione, &c. hæc il.]

  There, lyke a sorte of sottes,
  Ye were fayne to beare fagottes;
  At the feest of her concepcion
  Ye suffred suche correction.
    _Sive per æquivocum,_
  _Sive per univocum,_                                                  70
  _Sive sic, sive_ nat so,
  Ye are brought to, Lo, lo, lo!

[Sidenote: Convenio vos, O malesani, vani, profani Christiani.]

  Se where the heretykes go,
  Wytlesse wandring to and fro!
  With, Te he, ta ha, bo ho, bo ho!
  And suche wondringes many mo.
  Helas, ye wreches, ye may be wo!
  Ye may syng wele away,
  And curse bothe nyght and day,
  Whan ye were bredde and borne,                                        80

[Sidenote: Convenio vos, O Husiani, &c.]

  And whan ye were preestes shorne,
  Thus to be laughed to skorne,
  Thus tattred and thus torne,
  Thorowe your owne foly,
  To be blowen with the flye
  Of horryble heresy.
  Fayne ye were to reny,
  And mercy for to crye,
  Or be brende by and by,
  Confessyng howe ye dyde lye                                           90
  In prechyng shamefully.
    Your selfe thus ye discured
  As clerkes vnassured,
  With ignorance obscured:

[Sidenote: Convenio vos, O Lutheriani.]

  Ye are vnhappely vred.[772]
  In your dialeticall
  And principles silogisticall,
  If ye to remembrance call
  Howe _syllogisari_
  _Non est ex particulari_                                             100

[Sidenote: Neque non, neque legas.]

  _Neque negativis_,
  _Recte concludere si vis_,
  _Et cætera id genus_,
  Ye coude nat _corde tenus_,
  Nor answere _verbo tenus_,
  Whan prelacy you opposed;
  Your hertes than were hosed,

[Sidenote: Quoniam ignorantibus suppositiones veritatis propositionum non
relucent, &c.]

  Your relacions reposed;
  And yet ye supposed
  _Respondere ad quantum_,                                             110
  But ye were _confuse tantum_,
  Surrendring your supposycions,
  For there ye myst you[r] quosshons.
    Wolde God, for your owne ease,

[Sidenote: Harpocrates digito labiis impresso admonuit silentium fieri in
Isidis templo, &c.]

  That wyse Harpocrates
  Had your mouthes stopped,
  And your tonges cropped,

[Sidenote: Convenio vos, O coaxantes ranæ, &c.]

  Whan ye logyke chopped,
  And in the pulpete hopped,
  And folysshly there fopped,                                          120
  And porisshly forthe popped
  Your sysmaticate sawes
  Agaynst Goddes lawes,
  And shewed your selfe dawes!

[Sidenote: Sunt præterea nonnulli hujus farinæ, de quibus hic non est
narrandi locus.]

  Ye argued argumentes,
  As it were vpon the elenkes,
  _De rebus apparentibus_
  _Et non existentibus_;
  And ye wolde appere wyse,
  But ye were folysshe nyse:                                           130
  Yet be meanes of that vyse
  Ye dyde prouoke and tyse,
  Oftnar than ones or twyse,
  Many a good man
  And many a good woman,
  By way of their deuocion
  To helpe you to promocion,
  Whose charite wele regarded
  Can nat be vnrewarded.

[Sidenote: Convenio vos, O Herodiani.]

    I saye it for no sedicion,                                         140
  But vnder pacient tuicyon,
  It is halfe a supersticyon
  To gyue you exhibycion
  To mainteyne with your skoles,
  And to proue your selfe suche foles.
    Some of you had ten pounde,
  Therwith for to be founde
  At the vnyuersyte,
  Employed whiche myght haue be
  Moche better other wayes.                                            150

[Sidenote: Obscurus sarcasmos.]

  But, as the man sayes,
  The blynde eteth many a flye:
  What may be ment hereby,
  Ye may soone make construction
  With right lytell instruction;
  For it is an auncyent brute,

[Sidenote: Ex fructibus eorum cognoscetis eos, &c.]

  Suche apple tre, suche frute.
  What shulde I prosecute,
  Or more of this to clatter?
  Retourne we to our matter.                                           160

[Sidenote: Sublimius æquo aucupium agunt, &c.]

    Ye soored ouer hye
  In the ierarchy
  Of Iouenyans heresy,
  Your names to magnifye,
  Among the scabbed skyes

[Sidenote: Convenio vos, O Wichliftistæ.]

  Of Wycliffes flesshe flyes;
  Ye strynged so Luthers lute,
  That ye dawns all in a sute
  The heritykes ragged ray,
  That bringes you out of the way                                      170
  Of holy churches lay;
  Ye shayle _inter enigmata_
  And _inter paradigmata_,
  Marked in your cradels
  To beare fagottes for babyls.
    And yet some men say,
  Howe ye are this day,
  And be nowe as yll,
  And so ye wyll be styll,
  As ye were before.                                                   180
  What shulde I recken more?

[Sidenote: Convenio vos, O verbosi sophistæ, &c.]

    Men haue you in suspicion
  Howe ye haue small contrycion
  Of that ye haue myswrought:
  For, if it were well sought,
  One of you there was
  That laughed whan he dyd pas
  With his fagot in processyon;
  He counted it for no correction,
  But with scornefull affection                                        190
  Toke it for a sporte,
  His heresy to supporte;
  Whereat a thousande gased,
  As people halfe amased,
  And thought in hym smale grace
  His foly so to face.
    Some iuged in this case
  Your penaunce toke no place,
  Your penaunce was to lyght;

[Sidenote: Convenio vos, O díabolici dogmatistæ, &c.]

  And thought, if ye had right,                                        200
  Ye shulde take further payne
  To resorte agayne
  To places where ye haue preched,
  And your lollardy lernyng teched,
  And there to make relacion
  In open predycacion,
  And knowlege your offence
  Before open audyence,
  Howe falsely ye had surmysed,
  And deuyllysshely deuysed                                            210
  The[773] people to seduce,
  And chase them thorowe the muse
  Of your noughty counsell,
  To hunt them into hell,
  With blowyng out your hornes,
  Full of mockysshe scornes,
  With chatyng and rechatyng,
  And your busy pratyng:
  Of the gospell and the pystels

[Sidenote: Sunt plerique alii, sed non alieni, qui tantundem pæne
enuntiant, &c.]

  Ye pyke out many thystels,                                           220
  And bremely with your bristels
  Ye cobble and ye clout
  Holy Scripture so about,
  That people are in great dout
  And feare leest they be out
  Of all good Christen order.
  Thus all thyng ye disorder
  Thorowe out euery bord[e]r.

[Sidenote: Convenio vos, male docti legistæ, &c.]

    It had ben moche better
  Ye had neuer lerned letter,                                          230
  For your ignorance is gretter,
  I make you fast and sure,
  Than all your lytterature.
  Ye are but lydder _logici_,
  But moche worse _isagogici_,
  For ye haue enduced a secte
  With heresy all infecte;
  Wherfore ye are well checte,
  And by holy churche correcte,
  And in maner as abiecte,                                             240
  For euermore suspecte,
  And banysshed in effect
  From all honest company,
  Bycause ye haue eaten a flye,
  To your great vyllony,
  That neuer more may dye.

[Sidenote: Convenio vos, O hypocritæ, &c.]

    Come forthe, ye popeholy,
  Full of melancoly;
  Your madde ipocrisy,
  And your idiosy,                                                     250
  And your vayne glorie,

  Pufte full of heresy,
  To preche it idolatry,

  Why iangle you suche iestes,
  In your diuynite
  Of Luthers affynite,
  To the people of lay fee,
  Raylyng in your rages
  To worshyppe none ymages,
  Nor do pylgrymages?                                                  270
  I saye, ye deuyllysshe pages,
  Full of suche dottages,
  Count ye your selfe good clerkes,
  And snapper in suche werkes?

[Sidenote: Convenio vos, O dæmoniaci meridiani, &c.]

  Whiche _de latria_ do trete;
  They saye howe _latria_ is an honour grete,
  Belongyng to the Deite:
  To this ye nedes must agre.
    But, I trowe, your selfe ye ouerse
  What longeth to Christes humanyte.

[Sidenote: Nota de latria, hyperdulia, dulia, quid pro sancto sanxitum

  If ye haue reed _de hyperdulia_,
  Than ye knowe what betokeneth _dulia_:
  Than shall ye fynde it fyrme and stable,
  And to our faithe moche agreable,                                    290
  To worshyppe ymages of sayntes.
  Wherfore make ye no mo restrayntes,
  But mende your myndes that are mased;
  Or els doutlesse ye shalbe blased,
  And be brent at a stake,
  If further busynesse that ye make.

[Sidenote: O medici, mediam pertundite venam.]

  Therfore I vyse you to forsake
  Of heresy the deuyllysshe scoles,
  And crye Godmercy, lyke frantyke foles.

  Nor philosophy,

    Wherfore by and by
  Nowe consequently
  I call to this rekenyng

[Sidenote: David rex et propheta per divum Hieronymum matriculatur in

  Dauyd, that royall kyng,
  Whom Hieronymus,
  That doctour glorious,
  Dothe bothe write and call                                           320
  Poete of poetes all,
  And prophete princypall.

[Sidenote: Vos igitur omnes irrisores contemptoresque poetarum erubescite
cum ignominiosa vercundia, exitiosaque confusio operiat facies vestras.
hæc il.]

    This[775] may nat be remorded,
  For it is wele recorded
  In his pystell _ad Paulinum_,
  _Presbyterum divinum_,
  Where worde for worde ye may
  Rede what Jerome there dothe say.

_David, inquit, Simonides[776] noster, Pindarus, et Alcæus, Flaccus
quoque, Catullus, atque Serenus, Christum lyra personat, et in decachordo
psalterio ab inferis excitat resurgentem. Hæc Hier._

_The Englysshe._

  Kyng Dauid the prophete, of prophetes principall,
    Of poetes chefe poete, saint Jerome dothe wright,                  330
  Resembled to Symonides,[777] that poete lyricall
    Among the Grekes most relucent of lyght,
    In that faculte whiche shyned as Phebus bright;
  Lyke to Pyndarus in glorious poetry,
  Lyke vnto Alcheus, he dothe hym magnify.

  Flaccus nor Catullus with hym may nat compare,
    Nor solempne Serenus, for all his armony
  In metricall muses, his harpyng we may spare;
    For Dauid, our poete, harped so meloudiously
    Of our Sauyour Christ in his decacorde psautry,                    340
  That at his resurrection he harped out of hell
  Olde patriarkes and prophetes in heuen with him to dwell.

Returne we to our former processe.

  Than, if this noble kyng
  Thus can harpe and syng
  With his harpe of prophecy
  And spyrituall poetry,
  As saynt Jerome saythe,
  To whom we must gyue faythe,
  Warblyng with his strynges
  Of suche theologicall thynges,                                       350

  Why haue ye than disdayne

  Howe poetes do but fayne?
    Ye do moche great outrage,
  For to disparage
  And to discorage

  Of poetes laureate.
    For if ye sadly loke,

  A fole is he with welth that fallyth at debate:
  But men nowe a dayes so vnhappely be vryd,
  That nothynge than welth may worse be enduryd.
  To tell you the cause me semeth it no nede,
  The amense therof is far to call agayne;
  For when men by welth, they haue lytyll drede                         10
  Of that may come after; experyence trewe and playne,
  Howe after a drought there fallyth a showre of rayne,
  And after a hete oft cometh a stormy colde.
  A man may haue welth, but not, as he wolde,
  Ay to contynewe and styll to endure;
  But yf prudence be proued with sad cyrcumspeccyon,
  Welthe myght be wonne and made to the lure,
  If noblenesse were aquayntyd with sober dyreccyon;
  But wyll hath reason so vnder subieccyon,
  And so dysordereth this worlde ouer all,                              20
  That welthe and felicite is passynge small.
  But where wonnys Welthe, and a man wolde wyt?
  For welthfull Felicite truly is my name.

  _Lyberte._[780] Mary, Welthe and I was apoynted to mete,
  And eyther I am dysseyued, or ye be the same.

  _Fel._ Syr, as ye say, I haue harde of your fame;
  Your name is Lyberte, as I vnderstande.

  _Lyb._ Trewe you say, syr; gyue me your hande.

  _Fel._ And from whens come ye, and it myght be askyd?

  _Lyb._ To tell you, syr, I dare not, leest I sholde be maskyd         30
  In a payre of fetters or a payre of stockys.

  _Fel._ Here you not howe this gentylman mockys?

  _Lyb._ Ye, to knackynge ernyst what and it preue?

  _Fel._ Why, to say what he wyll, Lyberte hath leue.

  _Lyb._ Yet Lyberte hath ben lockyd vp and kept in the mew.

  _Fel._ In dede, syr, that lyberte was not worthe a cue:
  Howe be it lyberte may somtyme be to large,
  But yf reason be regent and ruler of your barge.

  _Lyb._ To that ye say I can well condyssende:
  Shewe forth, I pray you, here in what you intende.                    40

  _Fel._ Of that I intende to make demonstracyon,
  It askyth lesure with good aduertysment.
  Fyrst, I say, we owght to haue in consyderacyon,
  That lyberte be lynkyd with the chayne of countenaunce,
  Lyberte to let from all maner offence;
  For lyberte at large is lothe to be stoppyd,
  But with countenaunce your corage must be croppyd.

  _Lyb._ Then thus to you—

  _Fel._ Nay, suffer me yet ferther to say,
  And peraduenture I shall content your mynde.                          50
  Lyberte, I wote well, forbere no man there may,
  It is so swete in all maner of kynde;
  Howe be it lyberte makyth many a man blynde;
  By lyberte is done many a great excesse;
  Lyberte at large wyll oft wax reklesse:
  Perceyue ye this parcell?

  _Lyb._ Ye, syr, passyng well:
  But, and you wolde me permyt
  To shewe parte of my wyt,
  Somwhat I coulde enferre,                                             60
  Your consayte to debarre,
  Vnder supportacyon
  Of pacyent tolleracyon.

  _Fel._ God forbyd ye sholde be let
  Your reasons forth to fet;
  Wherfore at lyberte
  Say what ye wyll to me.

  _Lyb._ Brefly to touche of my purpose the effecte;
  Lyberte is laudable and pryuylegyd from lawe,
  Judycyall rygoure shall not me correcte—                              70

  _Fel._ Softe, my frende; herein your reason is but rawe.

  _Lyb._ Yet suffer me to say the surpluse of my sawe;
  What wote ye where vpon I wyll conclude?
  I say, there is no welthe where as lyberte is subdude;
  I trowe ye can not say nay moche to this;
  To lyue vnder lawe, it is captyuyte;
  Where drede ledyth the daunce, there is no ioy nor blysse;
  Or howe can you proue that there is felycyte,
  And you haue not your owne fre lyberte
  To sporte at your pleasure, to ryn and to ryde?                       80
  Where lyberte is absent, set welthe asyde.

_Hic intrat MEASURE._

  _Meas._ Cryst you assyste in your altrycacyon!

  _Fel._ Why, haue you harde of our dysputacyon?

  _Meas._ I parceyue well howe eche of you doth reason.

  _Lyb._ Mayster Measure, you be come in good season.

  _Meas._ And it is wonder that your wylde insolence
  Can be content with Measure presence.

  _Fel._ Wolde it please you then—

  _Lyb._ Vs to informe and ken—

  _Meas._ A, ye be wonders men!                                         90
  Your langage is lyke the penne
  Of hym that wryteth to fast.

  _Fel._ Syr, yf any worde haue past
  Me other fyrst or last,
  To you I arecte it, and cast
  Therof the reformacyon.

  _Lyb._ And I of the same facyon;
  Howe be it, by protestacyon,
  Dyspleasure that you none take,
  Some reason we must make.                                            100

  _Meas._ That wyll not I forsake,
  So it in measure be:
  Come of, therfore, let se;
  Shall I begynne or ye?

  _Fel._ Nay, ye shall begynne, by my wyll.

  _Lyb._ It is reason and skyll,
  We your pleasure fulfyll.

  _Meas._ Then ye must bothe consent
  You to holde content
  With myne argument;                                                  110
  And I muste you requyre
  Me pacyently to here.

  _Fel._ Yes, syr, with ryght good chere.

  _Lyb._ With all my herte intere.

  _Meas._ Oracius to recorde, in his volumys olde,
  With euery condycyon measure must be sought:
  Welthe without measure wolde here hymselfe to bolde,
  Lyberte without measure proue a thynge of nought;
  I ponder by nomber, by measure all thynge is wrought,
  As at the fyrst orygynall by godly opynyon,                          120
  Whych prouyth well that measure shold haue domynyon:
  Where measure is mayster, plenty dothe none offence;
  Where measure lackyth, all thynge dysorderyd is;
  Where measure is absent, ryot kepeth resydence;
  Where measure is ruler, there is nothynge amysse;
  Measure is treasure: howe say ye, is it not this?

  _Fel._ Yes, questyonlesse, in myne opynyon,
  Measure is worthy to haue domynyon.

  _Lyb._ Vnto that same I am ryght well agrede,
  So that lyberte be not lefte behynde.                                130

  _Meas._ Ye, lyberte with measure nede neuer drede.

  _Lyb._ What, lyberte to measure then wolde ye bynde?

  _Meas._ What ellys? for otherwyse it were agaynst kynde:
  If lyberte sholde lepe and renne where he lyst,
  It were no vertue, it were a thynge vnblyst;
  It were a myschefe, yf lyberte lacked a reyne,
  Where with to rule hym with the wrythyng of a rest:
  All trebyllys and tenours be rulyd by a meyne;
  Lyberte without measure is acountyd for a beste;
  There is no surfet where measure rulyth the feste;                   140
  There is no excesse where measure hath his helthe;
  Measure contynwyth prosperyte and welthe.

  _Fel._ Vnto your rule I wyll annex my mynde.

  _Lyb._ So wolde I, but I wolde be lothe,
  That wonte was to be formyst, now to come behynde:
  It were a shame, to God I make an othe,
  Without I myght cut it out of the brode clothe,
  As I was wonte euer at my fre wyll.

  _Meas._ But haue ye not herde say, that wyll is no skyll?
  Take sad dyreccyon, and leue this wantonnesse.                       150

  _Lyb._ It is[781] no maystery.

  _Fel._ Tushe, let Measure precede,
  And after his mynde herdely your selfe adresse;
  For, without measure, pouerte and nede
  Wyll crepe vpon vs, and vs to myschefe lede;
  For myschefe wyll mayster vs, yf measure vs forsake.

  _Lyb._ Well, I am content your wayes to take.

  _Meas._ Surely, I am ioyous that ye be myndyd thus.
  Magnyfycence to mayntayne, your promosyon shalbe.

  _Fel._ So in his harte he may be glad of vs.                         160

  _Lyb._ There is no prynce but he hath nede of vs thre,
  Welthe, with Measure and plesaunt Lyberte.

  _Meas._ Nowe pleasyth you a lytell whyle to stande;
  Me semeth Magnyfycence is comynge here at hande.

_Hic intrat MAGNYFYCENCE._

  _Magn._ To assure you of my noble porte and fame,
  Who lyst to knowe, Magnyfycence I hyght.
  But, Measure my frende, what hyght this mannys name?

  _Meas._ Syr, though ye be a noble prynce of myght,
  Yet in this man you must set your delyght;
  And, syr, this other mannys name is Lyberte.                         170

  _Magn._ Welcome, frendys, ye are bothe vnto me:
  But nowe let me knowe of your conuersacyon.

  _Fel._ Pleasyth your grace, Felycyte they me call.

  _Lyb._ And I am Lyberte, made of in euery nacyon.

  _Magn._ Conuenyent persons for any prynce ryall.
  Welthe with Lyberte, with me bothe dwell ye shall,
  To the gydynge of my Measure you bothe commyttynge:
  That Measure be mayster, vs semeth it is syttynge.

  _Meas._ Where as ye haue, syr, to me them assygned,
  Suche order, I trust, with them for to take,                         180
  So that welthe with measure shalbe conbyned,
  And lyberte his large with measure shall make.

  _Fel._ Your ordenaunce, syr, I wyll not forsake.

  _Lyb._ And I my selfe hooly to you wyll inclyne.

  _Magn._ Then may I say that ye be seruauntys myne,
  For by measure, I warne you, we thynke to be gydyd;
  Wherin it is necessary my pleasure you knowe,
  Measure and I wyll neuer be deuydyd
  For no dyscorde that any man can sawe;
  For measure is a meane, nother to by nor to lawe,                    190
  In whose attemperaunce I haue suche delyght,
  That measure shall neuer departe from my syght.

  _Fel._ Laudable your consayte is to be acountyd;
  For welthe without measure sodenly wyll slyde.

  _Lyb._ As your grace full nobly hath recountyd,
  Measure with noblenesse sholde be alyde.

  _Magn._ Then, Lyberte, se that Measure be your gyde,
  For I wyll vse you by his aduertysment.

  _Fel._ Then shall you haue with you prosperyte resydent.

  _Meas._ I trowe, good fortune hath annexyd vs together,              200
  To se howe greable we are of one mynde;
  There is no flaterer, nor losyll so lyther,
  This lynkyd chayne of loue that can vnbynde.
  Nowe that ye haue me chefe ruler assyngned,
  I wyll endeuour me to order euery thynge
  Your noblenesse and honour consernynge.

  _Lyb._ In ioy and myrthe your mynde shalbe inlargyd,
  And not embracyd with pusyllanymyte;
  But plenarly all thought from you must be dyschargyd,
  If ye lyst to lyue after your fre lyberte:                           210
  All delectacyons aquayntyd is with me,
  By me all persons worke what they lyste.

  _Meas._ Hem, syr, yet beware of Had I wyste!
  Lyberte in some cause becomyth a gentyll mynde,
  Bycause course of measure, yf I be in the way:
  Who countyth[782] without me, is caste to fer behynde
  Of his rekenynge, as euydently we may
  Se[783] at our eye the worlde day by day;
  For defaute of measure all thynge dothe excede.

  _Fel._ All that ye say is as trewe as the Crede;                     220
  For howe be it lyberte to welthe is conuenyent,
  And from felycyte may not be forborne,
  Yet measure hath ben so longe from vs absent,
  That all men laugh at lyberte to scorne;
  Welth and wyt, I say, be so threde bare worne,
  That all is without measure, and fer beyonde the mone.

  _Magn._ Then noblenesse, I se well, is almoste vndone,
  But yf therof the soner amendys be made;
  For dowtlesse I parceyue my magnyfycence
  Without measure lyghtly may fade,                                    230
  Of to moche lyberte vnder the offence:
  Wherfore, Measure, take Lyberte with you hence,
  And rule hym after the rule of your scole.

  _Lyb._ What, syr, wolde ye make me a poppynge fole?

  _Meas._ Why, were not your selfe agreed to the same,
  And now wolde ye swarue from your owne ordynaunce?

  _Lyb._ I wolde be rulyd, and I myght for shame.

  _Fel._ A, ye make me laughe at your inconstaunce.

  _Magn._ Syr, without any longer delyaunce,
  Take Lyberte to rule, and folowe myne entent.                        240

  _Meas._ It shalbe done at your commaundement.

_Itaque MEASURE exeat locum cum LIBERTATE, et maneat MAGNYFYCENCE cum
FELICITATE._

  _Magn._ It is a wanton thynge this Lyberte;
  Perceyue you not howe lothe he was to abyde
  The rule of Measure, notwithstandynge we
  Haue deputyd Measure hym to gyde?
  By measure eche thynge duly is tryde:
  Thynke you not thus, my frende Felycyte?

  _Fel._ God forbede that it other wyse sholde be!

  _Magn._ Ye coulde not ellys, I wote, with me endure.

  _Fel._ Endure? no, God wote, it were great payne;                    250
  But yf I were orderyd by iust measure,
  It were not possyble me longe to retayne.

_Hic intrat FANSY._

  _Fan._ Tusche, holde your pece, your langage is vayne.
  Please it your grace to take no dysdayne,
  To shewe you playnly the trouth as I thynke.

  _Magn._ Here is none forsyth whether you flete or synke.

  _Fel._ From whens come you, syr, that no man lokyd
  after?

  _Magn._ Or who made you so bolde to interrupe my tale?

  _Fan._ Nowe, _benedicite_, ye wene I were some hafter,
  Or ellys some iangelynge Jacke of the vale;                          260
  Ye wene that I am dronken, bycause I loke pale.

  _Magn._ Me semeth that ye haue dronken more than ye haue bled.

  _Fan._ Yet amonge noble men I was brought vp and bred.

  _Fel._ Nowe leue this iangelynge, and to vs expounde
  Why that ye sayd our langage was in vayne.

  _Fan._ Mary, vpon trouth my reason I grounde,
  That without largesse noblenesse can not rayne;
  And that I sayd ones, yet I say agayne,
  I say without largesse worshyp hath no place,
  For largesse is a purchaser of pardon and of grace.                  270

  _Magn._ Nowe, I beseche thé, tell me what is thy name?

  _Fan._ Largesse, that all lordes sholde loue, syr, I hyght.

  _Fel._ But hyght you, Largesse, encreace of noble fame?

  _Fan._ Ye, syr, vndoubted.

  _Fel._ Then, of very ryght,
  With Magnyfycence, this noble prynce of myght,
  Sholde be your dwellynge, in my consyderacyon.

  _Magn._ Yet we wyll therin take good delyberacyon.

  _Fan._ As in that, I wyll not be agaynst your pleasure.

  _Fel._ Syr, hardely remembre what may your name auaunce.              280

  _Magn._ Largesse is laudable, so it in measure be.

  _Fan._ Largesse is he that all prynces doth auaunce;
  I reporte me herein to Kynge Lewes of Fraunce.

  _Fel._ Why haue ye hym named, and all other refused?

  _Fan._ For, syth he dyed, largesse was lytell vsed.
  Plucke vp your mynde, syr; what ayle you to muse?
  Haue ye not welthe here at your wyll?
  It is but a maddynge, these wayes that ye vse:
  What auayleth lordshyp, yourselfe for to kyll
  With care and with thought howe Jacke shall haue Gyl?                290

  _Magn._ What? I haue aspyed ye are a carles page.

  _Fan._ By God, syr, ye se but fewe wyse men of myne age;
  But couetyse hath blowen you so full of wynde,
  That _colica passio_ hath gropyd you by the guttys.

  _Fel._ In fayth, broder Largesse, you haue a mery mynde.

  _Fan._ In fayth, I set not by the worlde two Dauncaster cuttys.

  _Magn._ Ye wante but a wylde flyeng bolte to shote at the buttes:
  Though Largesse ye hyght, your langage is to large;
  For whiche ende goth forwarde ye take lytell charge.

  _Fel._ Let se, this checke yf ye voyde canne.                        300

  _Fan._ In faythe, els had I gone to longe to scole,
  But yf I coulde knowe a gose from a swanne.

  _Magn._ Wel, wyse men may ete the fysshe, when ye shal draw the pole.

  _Fan._ In fayth, I wyll not say that ye shall proue a fole,
  But ofte tymes haue I sene wyse men do mad dedys.

  _Magn._ Go, shake the dogge,[784] hay, syth ye wyll nedys!
  You are nothynge mete with vs for to dwell,
  That with your lorde and mayster so pertly can prate:
  Gete you hens, I say, by my counsell;
  I wyll not vse you to play with me checke mate.                      310

  _Fan._ Syr, yf I haue offended your noble estate,
  I trow I haue brought you suche wrytynge of recorde,
  That I shall haue you agayne my good lorde:
  To you recommendeth Sad Cyrcumspeccyon,
  And sendeth you this wrytynge closed vnder sele.

  _Magn._ This wrytynge is welcome with harty affeccyon:
  Why kepte you it thus longe? howe dothe he? wele?

  _Fan._ Syr, thanked be God, he hath his hele.

  _Magn._ Welthe, gete you home, and commaunde me to Mesure;
  Byd hym take good hede to you, my synguler tresure.                  320

  _Fel._ Is there ony thynge elles your grace wyll commaunde me?

  _Magn._ Nothynge but fare you well tyll sone;
  And that he take good kepe to Lyberte.

  _Fel._ Your pleasure, syr, shortely shall be done.

  _Magn._ I shall come to you myselfe, I trowe, this after none.[785]
  I pray you, Larges, here to remayne,
  Whylest I knowe what this letter dothe contayne.

_Hic faciat tanquam legeret litteras tacite. Interim superveniat cantando

  _C. Count._ What, Fansy, Fansy!

  _Magn._ Who is that that thus dyd cry?
  Me thought he called Fansy.                                          330

  _Fan._ It was a Flemynge hyght Hansy.

  _Magn._ Me thought he called Fansy me behynde.

  _Fan._ Nay, syr, it was nothynge but your mynde:
  But nowe, syr, as touchynge this letter—

  _Magn._ I shall loke in it at leasure better:
  And surely ye are to hym beholde;
  And for his sake ryght gladly I wolde
  Do what I coude to do you good.

  _Fan._ I pray, God kepe you in that mood!

  _Magn._ This letter was wryten ferre hence.                          340

  _Fan._ By lakyn, syr, it hathe cost me pence
  And grotes many one, or I came to your presence.

  _Magn._ Where was it delyuered you, shewe vnto me.

  _Fan._ By God, syr, beyonde the se.

  _Magn._ At what place nowe, as you gesse?

  _Fan._ By my trouthe, syr, at Pountesse;
  This wrytynge was taken me there,
  But neuer was I in gretter fere.

  _Magn._ Howe so?

  _Fan._ By God, at the see syde,                                      350
  Had I not opened my purse wyde,
  I trowe, by our lady, I had ben slayne,
  Or elles I had lost myne eres twayne.

  _Magn._[788] By your soth?

  _Fan._ Ye, and there is suche a wache,
  That no man can scape but they hym cache.
  They bare me in hande that I was a spye;
  And another bade put out myne eye,
  Another wolde myne eye were blerde,
  Another bade shaue halfe my berde;                                   360
  And boyes to the pylery gan me plucke,
  And wolde haue made me Freer Tucke,
  To preche out of the pylery hole,
  Without an antetyme or a stole;
  And some bade sere hym with a marke:
  To gete me fro them I had moche warke.

  _Magn._ Mary, syr, ye were afrayde.

  _Fan._ By my trouthe, had I not payde and prayde,
  And made largesse as I hyght,
  I had not ben here with you this nyght;                              370
  But surely largesse saued my lyfe,
  For largesse stynteth all maner of stryfe.

  _Magn._ It dothe so sure nowe and than,
  But largesse is not mete for euery man.

  _Fan._ No, but for you grete estates:
  Largesse stynteth grete debates;
  And he that I came fro to this place
  Sayd I was mete for your grace;
  And in dede, syr, I here men talke,
  By the way as I ryde and walke,                                      380
  Say howe you excede in noblenesse,
  If you had with you largesse.

  _Magn._ And say they so in very dede?

  _Fan._ With ye, syr, so God me spede.

  _Magn._ Yet mesure is a mery mene.

  _Fan._ Ye, syr, a blannched almonde is no bene.
  Measure is mete for a marchauntes hall,
  But largesse becometh a state ryall.
  What, sholde you pynche at a peeke of otes,
  Ye wolde sone pynche at a pecke of grotes.                           390
  Thus is the talkynge of one and of oder,
  As men dare speke it hugger mugger;
  A lorde a negarde, it is a shame,
  But largesse may amende your name.

  _Magn._ In faythe, Largesse, welcome to me.

  _Fan._ I pray you, syr, I may so be,
  And of my seruyce you shall not mysse.

  _Magn._ Togyder we wyll talke more of this:
  Let vs departe from hens home to my place.

  _Fan._ I folow euen after your noble grace.                          400

_Hic discedat MAGNIFICENS cum FANSY, et intrat[789] COUNTERFET
COUNTENAUNCE._

  _C. Count._ What, I say, herke a worde.

  _Fan._ Do away, I say, the deuylles torde!

  _C. Count._ Ye, but how longe shall I here awayte?

  _Fan._ By Goddys body, I come streyte:
  I hate this blunderyng that thou doste make.

  _C. Count._ Nowe to the deuyll I thé betake,
  For in fayth ye be well met.
  Fansy hath cachyd in a flye net
  This noble man Magnyfycence,
  Of Largesse vnder the pretence.                                      410
  They haue made me here to put the stone:
  But nowe wyll I, that they be gone,
  In bastarde ryme, after the dogrell gyse,
  Tell you where of my name dothe ryse.
  For Counterfet Countenaunce knowen am I;
  This worlde is full of my foly.
  I set not by hym a fly,
  That can not counterfet a lye,
  Swere, and stare, and byde therby,
  And countenaunce it clenly,                                          420
  And defende it manerly.
  A knaue wyll counterfet nowe a knyght,
  A lurdayne lyke a lorde to fyght,[790]
  A mynstrell lyke a man of myght,
  A tappyster lyke a lady bryght:
  Thus make I them wyth thryft to fyght,
  Thus at the laste I brynge hym[791] ryght
  To Tyburne, where they hange on hyght.
  To counterfet I can by praty wayes:
  Of nyghtys to occupy counterfet kayes,                               430
  Clenly to counterfet newe arayes,
  Counterfet eyrnest by way of playes:
  Thus am I occupyed at all assayes;
  What so euer I do, all men me prayse,
  And mekyll am I made of nowe adays:
  Counterfet maters in the lawe of the lande,
  Wyth golde and grotes they grese my hande,
  In stede of ryght that wronge may stande,
  And counterfet fredome that is bounde;
  I counterfet[792] suger that is but founde;                          440
  Counterfet capytaynes by me are mande;
  Of all lewdnesse I kyndell the brande;
  Counterfet kyndnesse, and thynke dyscayte;
  Counterfet letters by the way of sleyght;
  Subtelly vsynge counterfet weyght;
  Counterfet langage, fayty bone geyte.
  Counterfetynge is a proper bayte;
  A counte to counterfet in a resayte;
  To counterfet well is a good consayte.
  Counterfet maydenhode may well be borne,                             450
  But counterfet coynes is laughynge to scorne;
  It is euyll patchynge of that is torne;
  Whan the noppe is rughe, it wolde be shorne;
  Counterfet haltynge without a thorne;
  Yet counterfet chafer is but euyll corne;
  All thynge is worse whan it is worne.
  What, wolde ye, wyues, counterfet
  The courtly gyse of the newe iet?
  An olde barne wolde be vnderset:
  It is moche worthe that is ferre fet.                                460
  What, wanton, wanton, nowe well ymet!
  What, Margery Mylke Ducke, mermoset!
  It wolde be masked in my net;
  It wolde be nyce, thoughe I say nay;
  By Crede, it wolde haue fresshe aray,
  And therfore shall my husbande pay;
  To counterfet she wyll assay
  All the newe gyse, fresshe and gaye,
  And be as praty as she may,
  And iet it ioly as a iay:                                            470
  Counterfet prechynge, and byleue the contrary;
  Counterfet conscyence, peuysshe pope holy;
  Counterfet sadnesse, with delynge full madly;
  Counterfet holynes is called ypocrysy;
  Counterfet reason is not worth a flye;
  Counterfet wysdome, and workes of foly;
  Counterfet countenaunce euery man dothe occupy:
  Counterfet worshyp outwarde men may se;
  Ryches rydeth out, at home is pouerte;
  Counterfet pleasure is borne out by me:                              480
  Coll wolde go clenly, and it wyll not be,
  And Annot wolde be nyce, and laughes, tehe wehe;
  Your counterfet countenaunce is all of nysyte,
  A plummed partrydge all redy to flye:
  A knokylbonyarde wyll counterfet a clarke,
  He wolde trotte gentylly, but he is to starke,
  At his cloked counterfetynge dogges dothe barke;
  A carter a courtyer, it is a worthy warke,
  That with his whyp his mares was wonte to yarke;
  A custrell to dryue the deuyll out of the derke,                     490
  A counterfet courtyer with a knaues marke.
  To counterfet this freers haue lerned me;
  This nonnes nowe and then, and it myght be,
  Wolde take in the way of counterfet charyte
  The grace of God vnder _benedicite_;
  To counterfet thyr counsell they gyue me a fee;
  Chanons can not counterfet but vpon thre,
  Monkys may not for drede that men sholde them se.

_Hic ingrediatur FANSY properanter cum CRAFTY CONUEYAUNCE, cum famine
multo[793] adinvicem garrulantes: tandem, viso COUNTERFET COUNTENAUNCE,
dicat CRAFTY CONUEYAUNCE._

  _Cr. Con._ What, Counterfet Countenaunce!

  _C. Count._ What, Crafty Conueyaunce!                                500

  _Fan._ What, the deuyll, are ye two of aquayntaunce?
  God gyue you a very myschaunce!

  _Cr. Con._ Yes, yes, syr, he and I haue met.

  _C. Count._ We haue bene togyder bothe erly and late:
  But, Fansy my frende, where haue ye bene so longe?

  _Fan._ By God, I haue bene about a praty pronge;
  Crafty Conueyaunce, I sholde say, and I.

  _Cr. Con._ By God, we haue made Magnyfycence to ete a flye.

  _C. Count._ Howe coulde ye do that, and [I] was away?

  _Fan._ By God, man, bothe his pagent and thyne he can play.          510

  _C. Count._ Say trouth?

  _Cr. Con._ Yes, yes, by lakyn, I shall thé warent,
  As longe as I lyue, thou haste an heyre parent.

  _Fan._ Yet haue we pyckyd out a rome for thé.

  _C. Count._ Why, shall we dwell togyder all thre?

  _Cr. Con._ Why, man, it were to great a wonder,
  That we thre galauntes sholde be longe asonder.

  _C. Count._ For Cockys harte, gyue me thy hande.

  _Fan._ By the masse, for ye are able to dystroy an hole lande.

  _Cr. Con._ By God, yet it muste begynne moche of thé.                520

  _Fan._ Who that is ruled by vs, it shalbe longe or he thee.

  _C. Count._ But, I say, kepest thou the olde name styll that thou had?

  _Cr. Con._ Why, wenyst thou, horson, that I were so mad?

  _Fan._ Nay, nay, he hath chaunged his, and I haue chaunged myne.

  _C. Count._ Nowe, what is his name, and what is thyne?

  _Fan._ In faythe, Largesse I hyght,
  And I am made a knyght.

  _C. Count._ A rebellyon agaynst nature,
  So large a man, and so lytell of stature!
  But, syr, howe counterfetyd ye?                                      530

  _Cr. Con._ Sure Surueyaunce[794] I named me.

  _C. Count._ Surueyaunce! where ye suruey,
  Thryfte hathe lost her cofer kay.

  _Fan._ But is it not well? howe thynkest thou?

  _C. Count._ Yes, syr, I gyue God auowe,
  Myselfe coude not counterfet it better.
  But what became of the letter,
  That I counterfeyted you vnderneth a shrowde?

  _Fan._ By the masse, odly well alowde.

  _Cr. Con._ By God, had not I it conuayed,                            540
  Yet Fansy had ben dysceyued.

  _C. Count._ I wote, thou arte false ynoughe for one.

  _Fan._ By my trouthe, we had ben gone:
  And yet, in fayth, man, we lacked thé
  For to speke with Lyberte.

  _C. Count._ What is Largesse without Lyberte?

  _Cr. Con._ By Mesure mastered yet is he.

  _C. Count._ What, is your conueyaunce no better?

  _Fan._ In faythe, Mesure is lyke a tetter,
  That ouergroweth a mannes face,                                      550
  So he ruleth ouer all our place.

  _Cr. Con._ Nowe therfore, whylest we are togyder,—
  Counterfet Countenaunce, nay, come hyder,—
  I say, whylest we are togyder in same—

  _C. Count._ Tushe, a strawe, it is a shame
  That we can no better than so.

  _Fan._ We wyll remedy it, man, or we go;
  For, lyke as mustarde is sharpe of taste,[795]
  Ryght so a sharpe fansy must be founde
  Wherwith Mesure to confounde.                                        560

  _Cr. Con._ Can you a remedy for a tysyke,
  That sheweth yourselfe thus spedde in physyke?

  _C. Count._ It is a gentyll reason of a rake.

  _Fan._ For all these iapes yet that ye[796] make—

  _Cr. Con._ Your fansy maketh myne elbowe to ake.

  _Fan._ Let se, fynde you a better way.

  _C. Count._ Take no dyspleasure of that we say.

  _Cr. Con._ Nay, and you be angry and ouerwharte,
  A man may beshrowe your angry harte.

  _Fan._ Tushe, a strawe, I thought none yll.                          570

  _C. Count._ What, shall we iangle thus all the day styll?

  _Cr. Con._ Nay, let vs our heddes togyder cast.

  _Fan._ Ye, and se howe it may be compast,
  That Mesure were cast out of the dores.

  _C. Count._ Alasse, where is my botes and my spores?

  _Cr. Con._ In all this hast whether wyll ye ryde?

  _C. Count._ I trowe, it shall not nede to abyde.
  Cockes woundes, se, syrs, se, se!

_Hic ingrediatur CLOKED COLUSYON cum elato aspectu, deorsum et sursum
ambulando._

  _Fan._ Cockes armes, what is he?

  _Cr. Con._ By Cockes harte, he loketh hye;                           580
  He hawketh, me thynke, for a butterflye.

  _C. Count._ Nowe, by Cockes harte, well abyden,
  For, had you not come, I had ryden.

  _Cl. Col._ Thy wordes be but wynde, neuer they haue no wayght;
  Thou hast made me play the iurde hayte.

  _C. Count._ And yf ye knewe howe I haue mused,
  I am sure ye wolde haue me excused.

  _Cl. Col._ I say, come hyder: what are these twayne?

  _C. Count._ By God, syr, this is Fansy small brayne;
  And Crafty Conuayaunce, knowe you not hym?                           590

  _Cl. Col._ Knowe hym, syr! quod he; yes, by Saynt Sym.
  Here is a leysshe of ratches to renne an hare:
  Woo is that purse that ye shall share!

  _Fan._ What call ye him, this?

  _Cr. Con._ I trowe, that he is.

  _C. Count._ Tushe, holde your pece.
  Se you not howe they prece
  For to knowe your name?

  _Cl. Col._ Knowe they not me, they are to blame.
  Knowe you not me, syrs?                                              600

  _Fan._ No, in dede.

  _Cr. Con._ Abyde, lette me se, take better hede:
  Cockes harte, it is Cloked Colusyon.

  _Cl. Col._ A, syr, I pray God gyue you confusyon!

  _Fan._ Cockes armes, is that your name?

  _C. Count._ Ye, by the masse, this is euen the same,
  That all this matter must vnder grope.

  _Cr. Con._ What is this he wereth, a cope?

  _Cl. Col._ Cappe, syr; I say you be to bolde.

  _Fan._ Se, howe he is wrapped for the colde:                         610
  Is it not a vestment?

  _Cl. Col._ A, ye wante a rope.

  _C. Count._ Tushe, it is Syr Johnn Double cloke.

  _Fan._ Syr, and yf ye wolde not be wrothe—

  _Cl. Col._ What sayst?

  _Fan._ Here was to lytell clothe.

  _Cl. Col._ A, Fansy, Fansy, God sende thé brayne!

  _Fan._ Ye, for your wyt is cloked for the rayne.

  _Cr. Con._ Nay, lette vs not clatter thus styll.

  _Cl. Col._ Tell me, syrs, what is your wyll.                         620

  _C. Count._ Syr, it is so that these twayne
  With Magnyfycence in housholde do remayne;
  And there they wolde haue me to dwell,
  But I wyll be ruled after your counsell.

  _Fan._ Mary, so wyll we also.

  _Cl. Col._ But tell me where aboute ye go.

  _C. Count._ By God, we wolde gete vs all thyder,
  Spell the remenaunt, and do togyder.

  _Cl. Col._ Hath Magnyfycence ony tresure?

  _Cr. Con._ Ye, but he spendeth it all in mesure.                     630

  _Cl. Col._ Why, dwelleth Mesure where ye two dwell?
  In faythe, he were better to dwell in hell.

  _Fan._ Yet where we wonne, nowe there wonneth he.

  _Cl. Col._ And haue you not amonge you Lyberte?

  _C. Count._ Ye, but he is a captyuyte.

  _Cl. Col._ What, the deuyll, howe may that be?

  _C. Count._ I can not tell you: why aske you me?
  Aske these two that there dothe dwell.

  _Cl. Col._ Syr, the playnesse you tell me.[797]

  _Cr. Con._ There dwelleth a mayster men calleth Mesure—              640

  _Fan._ Ye, and he hath rule of all his tresure.

  _Cr. Con._ Nay, eyther let me tell, or elles tell ye.

  _Fan._ I care not I, tell on for me.

  _C. Count._ I pray God let you neuer to thee!

  _Cl. Col._ What the deuyll ayleth you? can you not agree?

  _Cr. Con._ I wyll passe ouer the cyrcumstaunce,
  And shortly shewe you the hole substaunce.
  Fansy and I, we twayne,
  With Magnyfycence in housholde do remayne,
  And counterfeted our names we haue                                   650
  Craftely all thynges vpryght to saue,
  His name Largesse, Surueyaunce myne:
  Magnyfycence to vs begynneth to enclyne
  Counterfet Countenaunce to haue also,
  And wolde that we sholde for hym go.

  _C. Count._ But shall I haue myne olde name styll?

  _Cr. Con._ Pease, I haue not yet sayd what I wyll.

  _Fan._ Here is a pystell of a postyke!

  _Cl. Col._ Tusshe, fonnysshe Fansy, thou arte frantyke.
  Tell on, syr, howe then?                                             660

  _Cr. Con._ Mary, syr, he tolde vs, when
  We had hym founde, we sholde hym brynge,
  And that we fayled not for nothynge.

  _Cl. Col._ All this ye may easely brynge aboute.

  _Fan._ Mary, the better and Mesure were out.

  _Cl. Col._ Why, can ye not put out that foule freke?

  _Cr. Con._ No, in euery corner he wyll peke,
  So that we haue no lyberte,
  Nor no man in courte but he,
  For Lyberte he hath in gydyng.                                       670

  _C. Count._ In fayth, and without Lyberte there is no bydyng.

  _Fan._ In fayth, and Lybertyes rome is there but small.

  _Cl. Col._ Hem! that lyke I nothynge at all.

  _Cr. Con._ But, Counterfet[798] Countenaunce, go we togyder,
  All thre, I say.

  _C. Count._ Shall I go? whyder?

  _Cr. Con.[799]_ To Magnyfycence with vs twayne,
  And in his seruyce thé to retayne.

  _C. Count._ But then, syr, what shall I hyght?

  _Cr. Con._ Ye and I talkyd therof to nyght.                          680

  _Fan._ Ye, my Fansy was out of owle flyght,
  For it is out of my mynde quyght.

  _Cr. Con._ And nowe it cometh to my remembraunce:
  Syr, ye shall hyght Good Demeynaunce.

  _C. Count._ By the armes of Calys, well conceyued!

  _Cr. Con._ When we haue hym thyder conuayed,
  What and I frame suche a slyght,
  That Fansy with his fonde consayte
  Put Magnyfycence in suche a madnesse,
  That he shall haue you in the stede of sadnesse,                     690
  And Sober Sadnesse shalbe your name?

  _Cl. Col._ By Cockys body, here begynneth the game!
  For then shall we so craftely cary,
  That Mesure shall not there longe tary.

  _Fan._ For Cockys harte, tary whylyst that I come agayne.

  _Cr. Con._ We wyll se you shortly one of vs twayne.

  _C. Count._ Now let vs go, and we shall, then.

  _Cl. Col._ Nowe let se quyte you lyke praty men.[800]

_Hic deambulat._

  To passe the tyme and order whyle a man may talke
  Of one thynge and other to occupy the place;                         700
  Then for the season that I here shall walke,
  As good to be occupyed as vp and downe to trace
  And do nothynge; how be it full lytell grace
  There cometh and groweth of my comynge,
  For Clokyd Colusyon is a perylous thynge.
  Double delynge and I be all one;
  Craftynge and haftynge contryued is by me;
  I can dyssemble, I can bothe laughe and grone;
  Playne delynge and I can neuer agre;
  But dyuysyon, dyssencyon, dyrysyon, these thre                       710
  And I am counterfet of one mynde and thought,
  By the menys of myschyef to bryng all thynges to nought.
  And though I be so odyous a geste,
  And euery man gladly my company wolde refuse,
  In faythe yet am I occupyed with the best;
  Full fewe that can themselfe of me excuse.
  Whan other men laughe, than study I and muse,
  Deuysynge the meanes and wayes that I can,
  Howe I may hurte and hynder euery man:
  Two faces in a hode couertly I bere,                                 720
  Water in the one hande, and fyre in the other;
  I can fede forth a fole, and lede hym by the eyre;
  Falshode in felowshyp is my sworne brother.
  By cloked colusyon, I say, and none other,
  Comberaunce and trouble in Englande fyrst I began;
  From that lorde to that lorde I rode and I ran,
  And flatered them with fables fayre before theyr face,
  And tolde all the myschyef I coude behynde theyr backe,
  And made as I had knowen nothynge of the case;
  I wolde begyn all myschyef, but I wolde bere no lacke:               730
  Thus can I lerne you, syrs, to bere the deuyls sacke;
  And yet, I trowe, some of you be better sped than I
  Frendshyp to fayne, and thynke full lytherly.
  Paynte to a purpose good countenaunce I can,
  And craftely can I grope howe euery man is mynded;
  My purpose is to spy and to poynte euery man;
  My tonge is with fauell forked and tyned:
  By Cloked Colusyon thus many one is begyled.
  Eche man to hynder I gape and I gaspe;
  My speche is all pleasure, but I stynge lyke a waspe:                740
  I am neuer glad but whan I may do yll,
  And neuer am I sory but whan that I se
  I can not myne apyetyte accomplysshe and fulfyll
  In hynderaunce of welthe and prosperyte;
  I laughe at all shrewdenes, and lye at lyberte.
  I muster, I medle amonge these grete estates,
  I sowe sedycyous sedes of dyscorde and debates:
  To flater and to flery is all my pretence
  Amonge all suche persones as I well vnderstonde
  Be lyght of byleue and hasty of credence;                            750
  I make them to startyll and sparkyll lyke a bronde,
  I moue them, I mase them, I make them so fonde,
  That they wyll here no man but the fyrst tale:
  And so by these meanes I brewe moche bale.

_Hic ingrediatur COURTLY ABUSYON cantando._

  _Court. Ab._ Huffa, huffa, taunderum, taunderum, tayne, huffa, huffa!

  _Cl. Col._ This was properly prated, syrs! what sayd a?

  _Court. Ab._ _Wyda, wyda._
  Howe sayst thou, man? am not I a ioly rutter?

  _Cl. Col._ Gyue this gentylman rome, syrs, stonde vtter!
  By God, syr, what nede all this waste?
  What is this, a betell, or a batowe,[802] or a buskyn lacyd?

  _Court. Ab._ What, wenyst thou that I knowe thé not, Clokyd Colusyon?

  _Cl. Col._ And wenyst thou that I knowe not thé, cankard Abusyon?

  _Court. Ab._ Cankard Jacke Hare, loke thou be not rusty;
  For thou shalt well knowe I am nother durty nor dusty.

  _Cl. Col._ Dusty! nay, syr, ye be all of the lusty,                  770
  Howe be it of scape thryfte your clokes smelleth musty:
  But whether art thou walkynge in faythe vnfaynyd?

  _Court. Ab._ Mary, with Magnyfycence I wolde be retaynyd.

  _Cl. Col._ By the masse, for the cowrte thou art a mete man:
  Thy slyppers they swap it, yet thou fotys it lyke a swanne.

  _Court. Ab._ Ye, so I can deuyse my gere after the cowrtly maner.

  _Cl. Col._ So thou arte personable to bere a prynces baner.
  By Goddes fote,[803] and I dare well fyght, for I wyll not start.

  _Court. Ab._ Nay, thou art a man good inough but for thy false hart.

  _Cl. Col._ Well, and I be a coward, ther is mo than I.               780

  _Court. Ab._ Ye, in faythe, a bolde man and a hardy.

  _Cl. Col._ A bolde man in a bole of newe ale in cornys.

  _Court. Ab._ Wyll ye se this gentylman is all in his skornys?

  _Cl. Col._ But are ye not auysed to dwell where ye spake?

  _Court. Ab._ I am of fewe wordys, I loue not to barke.
  Beryst thou any rome, or cannyst thou do ought?
  Cannyst thou helpe in fauer that I myght be brought?

  _Cl. Col._ I may do somwhat, and more I thynke shall.

_Here cometh in CRAFTY CONUEYAUNCE, poyntyng with his fynger, and sayth,

  _Court. Ab._ Cockys harte, who is yonde that for thé dothe call?

  _Cr. Con.[804]_ Nay, come at ones, for the armys of the dyce!        790

  _Court. Ab._ Cockys armys, he hath callyd for thé twyce.

  _Cl. Col._ By Cockys harte, and call shall agayne:
  To come to me, I trowe, he shalbe fayne.

  _Court. Ab._ What, is thy harte pryckyd with such a prowde pynne?

  _Cl. Col._ Tushe, he that hath nede, man, let hym rynne.

  _Cr. Con._ Nay, come away, man: thou playst the cayser.

  _Cl. Col._ Here he is nowe, man; mayst thou not se?

  _Cr. Con._ What the deuyll, man, what thou menyst?
  Art thou so angry as thou semyst?

  _Court. Ab._ What the deuyll, can ye agre no better?

  _Fan._ Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

  _Cr. Con._ Cockes armes, it is not so, I trowe.

_Here CRAFTY CONU[EY]AUNCE putteth of his gowne._

  _Fol._ Put on thy gowne agayne, for nowe thou hast lost.[821]

  _Fan._ Lo, Johnn a Bonam, where is thy brayne?                      1220
  Nowe put on, fole, thy cote agayne.

  _Fol._ Gyue me my grote, for thou hast lost.

_Here FOLY maketh semblaunt to take money of CRAFTY CONUEYAUNCE, saynge
to hym_,

  Shyt thy purse, dawe, and do no cost.

  _Fan._ Nowe hast thou not a prowde mocke and a starke?

  _Cr. Con._ With, yes, by the rode of Wodstocke Parke.

  _Fan._ Nay, I tell thé, he maketh no dowtes
  To tourne a fole out of his clowtes.

  _Cr. Con._ And for a fole a man wolde hym take.

  _Fol._ Nay, it is I that foles can make;
  For, be he cayser or be he kynge,                                   1230
  To felowshyp with Foly I can hym brynge.

  _Fan._ Nay, wylte thou here nowe of his scoles,
  And what maner of people he maketh foles?

  _Cr. Con._ Ye, let vs here a worde or twayne.

  _Fol._ Syr, of my maner I shall tell you the playne.
  Fyrst I lay before them my bybyll,
  And teche them howe they sholde syt ydyll,
  To pyke theyr fyngers all the day longe;
  So in theyr eyre I synge them a songe,
  And make them so longe to muse,                                     1240
  That some of them renneth strayght to the stuse;
  To thefte and bryboury I make some fall,
  And pyke a locke and clyme a wall;
  And where I spy a nysot gay,
  That wyll syt ydyll all the day,
  And can not set herselfe to warke,
  I kyndell in her suche a lyther sparke,
  That rubbed she must be on the gall
  Bytwene the tappet[822] and the wall.

  _Cr. Con._ What, horson, arte thou suche a one?                     1250

  _Fan._ Nay, beyonde all other set hym alone.

  _Cr. Con._ Hast thou ony more? let se, procede.

  _Fol._ Ye, by God, syr, for a nede,
  I haue another maner of sorte,
  That I laugh at for my dysporte;
  And those be they that come vp of nought,
  As some be not ferre, and yf it were well sought:
  Suche dawys, what soeuer they be,
  That be set in auctorite,
  Anone he waxyth so hy and prowde,                                   1260
  He frownyth fyersly, brymly browde,
  The knaue wolde make it koy, and he cowde;
  All that he dothe, muste be alowde;
  And, This is not well done, syr, take hede;
  And maketh hym besy where is no nede:
  He dawnsys so longe, hey, troly loly,
  That euery man lawghyth at his foly.

  _Cr. Con._ By the good Lorde, truthe he sayth.

  _Fan._ Thynkyst thou not so, by thy fayth?

  _Cr. Con._ Thynke I not so, quod he! ellys haue I shame,            1270
  For I knowe dyuerse that vseth the same.

  _Fol._ But nowe, forsothe, man, it maketh no mater;
  For they that wyll so bysely smater,
  So helpe me God, man, euer at the length
  I make hym[823] lese moche of theyr strength;
  For with foly so do I them lede,
  That wyt he wantyth when he hath moste nede.

  _Fan._ Forsothe, tell on: hast thou any mo?[824]

  _Fol._ Yes, I shall tell you, or I go,
  Of dyuerse mo that hauntyth my scolys.                              1280

  _Cr. Con._ All men beware of suche folys!

  _Fol._ There be two lyther, rude and ranke,
  Symkyn Tytyuell and Pers Pykthanke;
  Theys lythers I lerne them for to lere
  What he sayth and she sayth to lay good ere,
  And tell to his sufferayne euery whyt,
  And then he is moche made of for his wyt;[825]
  And, be the mater yll more or lesse,
  He wyll make it mykyll worse than it is:
  But all that he dothe, and yf he reken well,                        1290
  It is but foly euery dell.

  _Fan._ Are not his wordys cursydly cowchyd?

  _Cr. Con._ By God, there be some that be shroudly towchyd:
  But, I say, let se and yf thou haue any more.

  _Fol._ I haue an hole armory of suche haburdashe in store;
  For there be other that foly dothe vse,
  That folowe fonde fantasyes and vertu refuse.

  _Fan._ Nay, that is my parte that thou spekest of nowe.

  _Fol._ So is all the remenaunt, I make God auowe;
  For thou fourmest suche fantasyes in theyr mynde,                   1300
  That euery man almost groweth out of kynde.

  _Cr. Con._ By the masse, I am glad that I came hyder,
  To here you two rutters dyspute togyder.

  _Fan._ Nay, but Fansy must be eyther fyrst or last.

  _Fol._ But whan Foly cometh, all is past.

  _Fan._ I wote not whether it cometh of thé or of me,
  But all is foly that I can se.

  _Cr. Con._ Mary, syr, ye may swere it on a boke.

  _Fol._ Ye, tourne ouer the lefe, rede there and loke,
  Howe frantyke Fansy fyrst of all                                    1310
  Maketh man and woman in foly to fall.

  _Cr. Con._ A, syr, a, a! howe by that!

  _Fan._ A peryllous thynge, to cast a cat
  Vpon a naked man, and yf she scrat.

  _Fol._ So how, I say, the hare is squat!
  For, frantyke Fansy, thou makest men madde;
  And I, Foly, bryngeth them to _qui fuit_ gadde,
  With _qui fuit_ brayne seke I haue them brought
  From _qui fuit aliquid_ to shyre shakynge nought.

  _Cr. Con._ Well argued and surely on bothe sydes:                   1320
  But for thé, Fansy, Magnyfycence abydes.

  _Fan._ Why, shall I not haue Foly with me also?

  _Cr. Con._ Yes, perde, man, whether that ye ryde or go:
  Yet for his name we must fynde a slyght.[826]

  _Fan._ By the masse, he shall hyght Consayte.

  _Cr. Con._ Not a better name vnder the sonne:
  With Magnyfycence thou shalte wonne.

  _Fol._ God haue mercy, good godfather.

  _Cr. Con._ Yet I wolde that ye had gone rather;
  For, as sone as you come in Magnyfycence syght,                     1330
  All mesure and good rule is gone quyte.

  _Fan._ And shall we haue lyberte to do what we wyll?

  _Cr. Con._ Ryot at lyberte russheth it out styll.

  _Fol._ Ye, but tell me one thynge.

  _Cr. Con._ What is that?

  _Fol._ Who is mayster of the masshe fat?

  _Fan._ Ye, for he hathe a full dry soule.

  _Cr. Con._ Cockes armes, thou shalte kepe the brewhouse boule.

  _Fol._ But may I drynke therof whylest that I stare?

  _Cr. Con._ When mesure is gone, what nedest thou spare?             1340
  Whan mesure is gone, we may slee care.

  _Fol._ Nowe then goo we hens, away the mare![827]

_CRAFTY CONUEYAUNCE alone in the place._

  _Cr. Con._ It is wonder to se the worlde aboute,
  To se what foly is vsed in euery place;
  Foly hath a rome, I say, in euery route,
  To put, where he lyst, Foly hath fre chace;
  Foly and Fansy all where, euery man dothe face and brace;
  Foly fotyth it properly, Fansy ledyth the dawnce;
  And next come I after, Crafty Conueyaunce.
  Who so to me gyueth good aduertence,                                1350
  Shall se many thyngys donne craftely:
  By me conueyed is wanton insolence,
  Pryuy poyntmentys conueyed so properly,
  For many tymes moche kyndnesse is denyed
  For drede that we dare not ofte lest we be spyed;
  By me is conueyed mykyll praty ware,
  Somtyme, I say, behynde the dore for nede;
  I haue an hoby can make larkys to dare;
  I knyt togyther many a broken threde.
  It is great almesse the hungre[828] to fede,                        1360
  To clothe the nakyd where is lackynge a smocke,
  Trymme at her tayle, or a man can turne a socke:
  What howe, be ye mery! was it not well conueyed?
  As oft as ye lyst, so honeste be sauyd;
  Alas, dere harte, loke that we be not perseyuyd!
  Without crafte nothynge is well behauyd;
  Though I shewe you curtesy, say not that I craue,[829]
  Yet conuey it craftely, and hardely spare not for me,
  So that there knowe no man but I and she.
  Thefte also and pety brybery                                        1370
  Without me be full oft aspyed;
  My inwyt delynge there can no man dyscry,
  Conuey it be crafte, lyft and lay asyde:
  Full moche flatery and falsehode I hyde,
  And by crafty conueyaunce I wyll, and I can,
  Saue a stronge thefe and hange a trew man.
  But some man wolde conuey, and can not skyll,
  As malypert tauernars that checke with theyr betters,
  Theyr conueyaunce weltyth the worke all by wyll;
  And some wyll take vpon them to conterfet letters,                  1380
  And therwithall conuey hymselfe into a payre of fetters;
  And some wyll conuey by the pretence of sadnesse,
  Tyll all theyr conueyaunce is turnyd into madnesse.
  Crafty conueyaunce is no chyldys game:
  By crafty conueyaunce many one is brought vp of nought;
  Crafty Conueyaunce can cloke hymselfe frome shame,
  For by crafty conueyaunce wonderful thynges are wrought:
  By conuayaunce crafty I haue brought
  Vnto Magnyfyce[nce] a full vngracyous sorte,
  For all hokes vnhappy to me haue resorte.                           1390

_Here cometh in MAGNYFYCENCE with LYBERTE and FELYCYTE._

  _Magn._ Trust me, Lyberte, it greueth me ryght sore
  To se you thus ruled and stande in suche awe.

  _Lyb._ Syr, as by my wyll, it shall be so no more.

  _Fel._ Yet lyberte without rule is not worth a strawe.

  _Magn._ Tushe, holde your peas, ye speke lyke a dawe;
  Ye shall be occupyed, Welthe, at my wyll.

  _Cr. Con._ All that ye say, syr, is reason and skyll.

  _Magn._ Mayster Suruayour, where haue ye ben so longe?
  Remembre ye not how my lyberte by mesure ruled was?

  _Cr. Con._ In good faythe, syr, me semeth he had the more wronge.   1400

  _Lyb._ Mary, syr, so dyd he excede and passe,
  They droue me to lernynge lyke a dull asse.

  _Fel._ It is good yet that lyberte be ruled by reason.

  _Magn._ Tushe, holde your peas, ye speke out of season:
  Yourselfe shall be ruled by lyberte and largesse.

  _Fel._ I am content, so it in measure be.

  _Lyb._ Must mesure, in the mares name, you furnysshe and dresse?

  _Magn._ Nay, nay, not so, my frende Felycyte.

  _Cr. Con._ Not, and your grace wolde be ruled by me.

  _Lyb._ Nay, he shall be ruled euen as I lyst.                       1410

  _Fel._ Yet it is good to beware of Had I wyst.

  _Magn._ Syr, by lyberte and largesse I wyll that ye shall
  Be gouerned and gyded: wote ye what I say?
  Mayster Suruayour, Largesse to me call.

  _Cr. Con._ It shall be done.

  _Magn._ Ye, but byd hym come away
  At ones, and let hym not tary all day.

_Here goth out CRAFTY CONUAYAUNCE._

  _Fel._ Yet it is good wysdome to worke wysely by welth.

  _Lyb._ Holde thy tonge, and thou loue thy helth.

  _Magn._ What, wyll ye waste wynde, and prate thus in vayne?         1420
  Ye haue eten sauce, I trowe, at the Taylers Hall.

  _Lyb._ Be not to bolde, my frende; I counsell you, bere a brayne.

  _Magn._ And what so we say, holde you content withall.

  _Fel._ Syr, yet without sapyence your substaunce may be smal;
  For, where is no mesure, howe may worshyp endure?

_Here cometh in FANSY._

  _Fan._ Syr, I am here at your pleasure;
  Your grace sent for me, I wene; what is your wyll?

  _Magn._ Come hyther, Largesse, take here Felycyte.

  _Fan._ Why, wene you that I can kepe hym longe styll?

  _Magn._ To rule as ye lyst, lo, here is Lyberte!                    1430

  _Lyb._ I am here redy.

  _Fan._ What, shall we haue welth at our gydynge to rule as we lyst?
  Then fare well thryfte, by hym that crosse kyst!

  _Fel._ I truste your grace wyll be agreabyll
  That I shall suffer none impechment
  By theyr demenaunce nor losse repryuable.

  _Magn._ Syr, ye shall folowe myne appetyte and intent.

  _Fel._ So it be by mesure I am ryght well content.

  _Fan._ What, all by mesure, good syr, and none excesse?

  _Lyb._ Why, welth hath made many a man braynlesse.                  1440

  _Fel._ That was by the menys of to moche lyberte.

  _Magn._ What can ye agree thus and appose?

  _Fel._ Syr, as I say, there was no faute in me.

  _Lyb._ Ye, of Jackeathrommys bybyll can ye make a glose?

  _Fan._ Sore sayde, I tell you, and well to the purpose:
  What sholde a man do with you, loke you vnder kay.[830]

  _Fel._ I say, it is foly to gyue all welth away.

  _Lyb._ Whether sholde welth be rulyd by lyberte,
  Or lyberte by welth? let se, tell me that.

  _Fel._ Syr, as me semeth, ye sholde be rulyd by me.                 1450

  _Magn._ What nede you with hym thus prate and chat?

  _Fan._ Shewe vs your mynde then, howe to do and what.

  _Magn._ I say, that I wyll ye haue hym in gydynge.

  _Lyb._ Mayster Felycyte, let be your chydynge,
  And so as ye se it wyll be no better,
  Take it in worthe suche as ye fynde.

  _Fan._ What the deuyll, man, your name shalbe the greter,
  For welth without largesse is all out of kynde.

  _Lyb._ And welth is nought worthe, yf lyberte be behynde.

  _Magn._ Nowe holde ye content, for there is none other shyfte.      1460

  _Fel._ Than waste must be welcome, and fare well thryfte!

  _Magn._ Take of his substaunce a sure inuentory,
  And get thou[831] home togyther; for Lyberte shall byde,
  And wayte vpon me.

  _Lyb._ And yet for a memory,
  Make indentures howe ye and I shal gyde.

  _Fan._ I can do nothynge but he stonde besyde.

  _Lyb._ Syr, we can do nothynge the one without the other.

  _Magn._ Well, get you hens than, and sende me some other.

  _Fan._ Whom? lusty Pleasure, or mery Consayte?                      1470

  _Magn._ Nay, fyrst lusty Pleasure is my desyre to haue,
  And let the other another[832] awayte,
  Howe be it that fonde felowe is a mery knaue;
  But loke that ye occupye the auctoryte that I you gaue.

[_Here goeth out FELYCYTE, LYBERTE, and FANSY._

_MAGNYFYCENCE alone in the place._

  For nowe,[833] syrs, I am lyke as a prynce sholde be;
  I haue welth at wyll, largesse and lyberte:
  Fortune to her lawys can not abandune me,
  But I shall of Fortune rule the reyne;
  I fere nothynge Fortunes perplexyte;
  All honour to me must nedys stowpe and lene;                        1480
  I synge of two partys without a mene;
  I haue wynde and wether ouer all to sayle,
  No stormy rage agaynst me can peruayle.
  Alexander, of Macedony kynge,
  That all the oryent had in subieccyon,
  Though al his conquestys were brought to rekenynge,
  Myght seme ryght wel vnder my proteccyon
  To rayne, for all his marcyall affeccyon;
  For I am prynce perlesse prouyd of porte,
  Bathyd with blysse, embracyd with comforte.                         1490
  Syrus, that soleme syar of Babylon,
  That Israell releysyd of theyr captyuyte,
  For al his pompe, for all his ryall trone,
  He may not be comparyd vnto me.
  I am the dyamounde dowtlesse of dygnyte:
  Surely it is I that all may saue and spyll;
  No man so hardy to worke agaynst my wyll.
  Porcenya, the prowde prouoste of Turky lande,
  That ratyd the Romaynes and made them yll rest,
  Nor Cesar July, that no man myght withstande,                       1500
  Were neuer halfe so rychely as I am drest:
  No, that I assure you; loke who was the best.
  I reyne in my robys, I rule as me lyst,
  I dryue downe th[e]se dastardys with a dynt of my fyste.
  Of Cato the counte acountyd the cane,
  Daryus, the doughty cheftayn of Perse,
  I set not by the prowdest of them a prane,
  Ne by non other that any man can rehersse.
  I folowe in felycyte without reue[r]sse,
  I drede no daunger, I dawnce all in delyte;                         1510
  My name is Magnyfycence, man most of myght.
  Hercules the herdy, with his stobburne clobbyd mase,
  That made Cerberus to cache, the cur dogge of hell,
  And Thesius, that[834] prowde was Pluto to face,
  It wolde not become them with me for to mell:
  For of all barones bolde I bere the bell,
  Of all doughty I am doughtyest duke, as I deme;
  To me all prynces to lowte man be sene.[835]
  Cherlemayne, that mantenyd the nobles of Fraunce,
  Arthur of Albyan, for all his brymme berde,                         1520
  Nor Basyan the bolde, for all his brybaunce,
  Nor Alerycus, that rulyd the Gothyaunce by swerd,
  Nor no man on molde can make me aferd.
  What man is so maysyd with me that dare mete,
  I shall flappe hym as a fole to fall at my fete.
  Galba, whom his galantys garde for agaspe,
  Nor Nero, that nother set by God nor man,
  Nor Vaspasyan, that bare in his nose a waspe,
  Nor Hanyball agayne Rome gates that ranne,
  Nor yet Cypyo,[836] that noble Cartage wanne,                       1530
  Nor none so hardy of them with me that durste crake,
  But I shall frounce them on the foretop, and gar them to quake.

_Here cometh in COURTLY ABUSYON, doynge reuerence and courtesy._

  _Court. Ab._ At your commaundement, syr, wyth all dew reuerence.

  _Magn._ Welcom, Pleasure, to our magnyfycence.

  _Court. Ab._ Plesyth it your grace to shewe what I do shall?

  _Magn._ Let vs here of your pleasure to passe the tyme withall.

  _Court. Ab._ Syr, then with the fauour of your benynge sufferaunce
  To shewe you my mynde myselfe I wyll auaunce,
  If it lyke your grace to take it in degre.

  _Magn._ Yes, syr, so good man in you I se,                          1540
  And in your delynge so good assuraunce,
  That we delyte gretly in your dalyaunce.

  _Court. Ab._ A, syr, your grace me dothe extole and rayse,
  And ferre beyond my merytys ye me commende and prayse;
  Howe be it, I wolde be ryght gladde, I you assure,
  Any thynge to do that myght be to your pleasure.

  _Magn._ As I be saued, with pleasure I am supprysyd
  Of your langage, it is so well deuysed;
  Pullyshyd and fresshe is your ornacy.

  _Court. Ab._ A, I wolde to God that I were halfe so crafty,         1550
  Or in electe vtteraunce halfe so eloquent,
  As that I myght your noble grace content!

  _Magn._ Truste me, with you I am hyghly pleasyd,
  For in my fauour I haue you feffyd and seasyd.
  He is not lyuynge your maners can amend;
  Mary, your speche is as pleasant as though it were pend;
  To here your comon, it is my hygh comforte;
  Poynt deuyse all pleasure is your porte.

  _Court. Ab._ Syr, I am the better of your noble reporte;
  But, of your pacyence vnder the supporte,                           1560
  If it wolde lyke you to here my pore mynde—

  _Magn._ Speke, I beseche thé, leue nothynge behynde.

  _Court. Ab._ So as ye be a prynce of great myght,
  It is semynge your pleasure ye delyte,
  And to aqueynte you with carnall delectacyon,
  And to fall in aquayntaunce with euery newe facyon;
  And quyckely your appetytes to sharpe and adresse,
  To fasten your fansy vpon a fayre maystresse,
  That quyckly is enuyued with rudyes of the rose,
  Inpurtured with fetures after your purpose,                         1570
  The streynes of her vaynes as asure inde blewe,
  Enbudded with beautye and colour fresshe of hewe,
  As lyly whyte to loke vpon her leyre,[837]
  Her eyen relucent as carbuncle so clere,
  Her mouthe enbawmed, dylectable and mery,
  Her lusty lyppes ruddy as the chery:
  Howe lyke you? ye lacke, syr, suche a lusty lasse.

  _Magn._ A, that were a baby to brace and to basse!
  I wolde I had, by hym that hell dyd harowe,
  With me in kepynge suche a Phylyp sparowe!                          1580
  I wolde hauke whylest my hede dyd warke,
  So I myght hobby for suche a lusty larke.
  These wordes in myne eyre they be so lustely spoken,
  That on suche a female my flesshe wolde be wroken;
  They towche me so thorowly, and tykyll my consayte,
  That weryed I wolde be on suche a bayte:
  A, Cockes armes, where myght suche one be founde?

  _Court. Ab._ Wyll ye spende ony money?

  _Magn._ Ye, a thousande pounde.

  _Court. Ab._ Nay, nay, for lesse I waraunt you to be sped,          1590
  And brought home, and layde in your bed.

  _Magn._ Wolde money, trowest thou, make suche one to the call?

  _Court. Ab._ Money maketh marchauntes, I tell you, over all.

  _Magn._ Why, wyl a maystres be wonne for money and for golde?

  _Court. Ab._ Why, was not for money Troy bothe bought and solde?
  Full many a stronge cyte and towne hath ben wonne
  By the meanes of money without ony gonne.
  A maystres, I tell you, is but a small thynge;
  A goodly rybon, or a golde rynge,
  May wynne with a sawte the fortresse of the holde;                  1600
  But one thynge I warne you, prece forth and be bolde.

  _Magn._ Ye, but some be full koy and passynge harde harted.

  _Court. Ab._ But, blessyd be our Lorde, they wyll be sone conuerted.

  _Magn._ Why, wyll they then be intreted, the most and the lest?

  _Court. Ab._ Ye, for _omnis mulier meretrix, si celari potest_.

  _Magn._ A, I haue spyed ye can moche broken sorowe.

  _Court. Ab._ I coude holde you with suche talke hens tyll to morowe;
  But yf it lyke your grace, more at large
  Me to permyt my mynde to dyscharge,
  I wolde yet shewe you further of my consayte.                       1610

  _Magn._ Let se what ye say, shewe it strayte.

  _Court. Ab._ Wysely let these wordes in your mynde be wayed:
  By waywarde wylfulnes let eche thynge be conuayed;
  What so euer ye do, folowe your owne wyll;
  Be it reason or none, it shall not gretely skyll;
  Be it ryght or wronge, by the aduyse of me,
  Take your pleasure and vse free lyberte;
  And yf you se ony thynge agaynst your mynde,
  Then some occacyon of[838] quarell ye must fynde,
  And frowne it and face it, as thoughe ye wolde fyght,               1620
  Frete yourselfe for anger and for dyspyte;
  Here no man, what so euer they say,
  But do as ye lyst, and take your owne way.

  _Magn._ Thy wordes and my mynde odly well accorde.

  _Court. Ab._ What sholde ye do elles? are not you a lorde?
  Let your lust and lykynge stande for a lawe;
  Be wrastynge and wrythynge, and away drawe.
  And ye se a man that with hym ye be not pleased,
  And that your mynde can not well be eased,
  As yf a man fortune to touche you on the quyke,                     1630
  Then feyne yourselfe dyseased and make yourselfe seke:
  To styre vp your stomake you must you forge,
  Call for a candell[839] and cast vp your gorge;
  With, Cockes armes, rest shall I none haue
  Tyll I be reuenged on that horson knaue!
  A, howe my stomake wambleth! I am all in a swete!
  Is there no horson that knaue that wyll bete?

  _Magn._ By Cockes woundes, a wonder felowe thou arte;
  For ofte tymes suche a wamblynge goth ouer my harte;
  Yet I am not harte seke, but that me lyst                           1640
  For myrth I haue hym coryed, beten, and blyst,
  Hym that I loued not and made hym to loute,
  I am forthwith as hole as a troute;
  For suche abusyon I vse nowe and than.

  _Court. Ab._ It is none abusyon, syr, in a noble man,
  It is a pryncely pleasure and a lordly mynde;
  Suche lustes at large may not be lefte behynde.

_Here cometh in CLOKED COLUSYON with MESURE._

  _Cl. Col._ Stande styll here, and ye shall se
  That for your sake I wyll fall on my kne.

  _Court. Ab._ Syr, Sober Sadnesse cometh, wherfore it be?            1650

  _Magn._ Stande vp, syr, ye are welcom to me.

  _Cl. Col._ Please it your grace, at the contemplacyon
  Of my pore instance and supplycacyon,
  Tenderly to consyder in your aduertence,
  Of our blessyd Lorde, syr, at the reuerence,
  Remembre the good seruyce that Mesure hath you done,
  And that ye wyll not cast hym away so sone.

  _Magn._ My frende, as touchynge to this your mocyon,
  I may say to you I haue but small deuocyon;
  Howe be it, at your instaunce I wyll the rather                     1660
  Do as moche as for myne owne father.

  _Cl. Col._ Nay, syr, that affeccyon ought to be reserued,
  For of your grace I haue it nought deserued;
  But yf it lyke you that I myght rowne in your eyre,
  To shewe you my mynde I wolde haue the lesse fere.

  _Magn._ Stande a lytell abacke, syr, and let hym come hyder.

  _Court. Ab._ With a good wyll, syr, God spede you bothe togyder.

  _Cl. Col._ Syr, so it is, this man is here by,
  That for hym to laboure he hath prayde me hartely;
  Notwithstandynge to you be it sayde,                                1670
  To trust in me he is but dyssayued;
  For, so helpe me God, for you he is not mete:
  I speke the softlyer, because he sholde not wete.

  _Magn._ Come hyder, Pleasure, you shall here myne entent:
  Mesure, ye knowe wel, with hym I can not be content,
  And surely, as I am nowe aduysed,
  I wyll haue hym rehayted and dyspysed.
  Howe say ye, syrs? herein what is best?

  _Court. Ab._ By myne aduyse with you in fayth he shall not rest.

  _Cl. Col._ Yet, syr, reserued your better aduysement,               1680
  It were better he spake with you or he wente,
  That he knowe not but that I haue supplyed
  All that I can his matter for to spede.

  _Magn._ Nowe, by your trouthe, gaue he you not a brybe?

  _Cl. Col._ Yes, with his hande I made hym to subscrybe
  A byll of recorde for an annuall rent.

  _Court. Ab._ But for all that he is lyke to haue a glent.

  _Cl. Col._ Ye, by my trouthe, I shall waraunt you for me,
  And he go to the deu[y]ll, so that I may haue my fee,
  What care I?                                                        1690

  _Magn._ By the masse, well sayd.

  _Court. Ab._ What force ye, so that ye[840] be payde?

  _Cl. Col._ But yet, lo, I wolde, or that he wente,
  Lest that he thought that his money were euyll spente,
  That ye[841] wolde loke on hym, thoughe it were not longe.

  _Magn._ Well cannest thou helpe a preest to synge a songe.

  _Cl. Col._ So it is all the maner nowe a dayes,
  For to vse suche haftynge and crafty wayes.

  _Court. Ab._ He telleth you trouth, syr, as I you ensure.

  _Magn._ Well, for thy sake the better I may endure                  1700
  That he come hyder, and to gyue hym a loke
  That he shall lyke the worse all this woke.

  _Cl. Col._ I care not howe sone he be refused,
  So that I may craftely be excused.

  _Court. Ab._ Where is he?

  _Cl. Col._ Mary, I made hym abyde,
  Whylest I came to you, a lytell here besyde.

  _Magn._ Well, call hym, and let vs here hym reason,
  And we wyll be comonynge in the mene season.

  _Court. Ab._ This is a wyse man, syr, where so euer ye hym had.      1710

  _Magn._ An honest person, I tell you, and a sad.

  _Court. Ab._ He can full craftely this matter brynge aboute.

  _Magn._ Whylest I haue hym, I nede nothynge doute.

_Hic introducat COLUSION, MESURE, MAGNYFYCENCE aspectant[e] vultu
elatissimo._

  _Cl. Col._ By the masse, I haue done that I can,
  And more than euer I dyd for ony man:
  I trowe, ye herde yourselfe what I sayd.

  _Mes._ Nay, indede; but I sawe howe ye prayed,
  And made instance for me be lykelyhod.

  _Cl. Col._ Nay, I tell you, I am not wonte to fode
  Them that dare put theyr truste in me;                              1720
  And therof ye shall a larger profe se.

  _Mes._ Syr, God rewarde you as ye haue deserued:
  But thynke you with Magnyfycence I shal be reserued?

  _Cl. Col._ By my trouth, I can not tell you that;
  But, and I were as ye, I wolde not set a gnat
  By Magnyfycence, nor yet none of his,
  For, go when ye shall, of you shall he mysse.

  _Mes._ Syr, as ye say.

  _Cl. Col._ Nay, come on with me:
  Yet ones agayne I shall fall on my kne                              1730
  For your sake, what so euer befall;
  I set not a flye, and all go to all.

  _Mes._ The Holy Goost be with your grace.

  _Cl. Col._ Syr, I beseche you, let pety haue some place
  In your brest towardes this gentylman.

  _Magn._ I was your good lorde tyll that ye beganne
  So masterfully vpon you for to take
  With my seruauntys, and suche maystryes gan make,
  That holly my mynde with you is myscontente;
  Wherfore I wyll that ye be resydent                                 1740
  With me no longer.

  _Cl. Col._ Say somwhat nowe, let se, for your selfe.[842]

  _Mes._ Syr, yf I myght permytted be,
  I wolde to you say a worde or twayne.

  _Magn._ What, woldest thou, lurden, with me brawle agayne?
  Haue hym hens, I say, out of my syght;
  That day I se hym, I shall be worse all nyght.

[_Here MESURE goth out of the place._[843]

  _Court. Ab._ Hens, thou haynyarde, out of the dores fast!

  _Magn._ Alas, my stomake fareth as it wolde cast!

  _Cl. Col._ Abyde, syr, abyde, let me holde your hede.               1750

  _Magn._ A bolle or a basyn, I say, for Goddes brede!
  A, my hede! But is the horson gone?
  God gyue hym a myscheffe! Nay, nowe let me alone.

  _Cl. Col._ A good dryfte, syr, a praty fete:
  By the good Lorde, yet your temples bete.

  _Magn._ Nay, so God me helpe, it was no grete vexacyon,
  For I am panged ofte tymes of this same facyon.

  _Cl. Col._ Cockes armes, howe Pleasure plucked hym forth!

  _Magn._ Ye, walke he must, it was no better worth.

  _Cl. Col._ Syr, nowe me thynke your harte is well eased.            1760

  _Magn._ Nowe Measure is gone, I am the better pleased.

  _Cl. Col._ So to be ruled by measure, it is a payne.

  _Magn._ Mary, I wene he wolde not be glad to come agayne.

  _Cl. Col._ So I wote not what he sholde do here:
  Where mennes belyes is mesured, there is no chere;
  For I here but fewe men that gyue ony prayse
  Vnto measure, I say, nowe a days.

  _Magn._ Measure, tut! what, the deuyll of hell!
  Scantly one with measure that wyll dwell.

  _Cl. Col._ Not amonge noble men, as the worlde gothe:               1770
  It is no wonder therfore thoughe ye be wrothe
  With Mesure. Where as all noblenes is, there I haue past:
  They catche that catche may, kepe and holde fast,
  Out of all measure themselfe to enryche;
  No force what thoughe his neyghbour dye in a dyche.
  With pollynge and pluckynge out of all measure,
  Thus must ye stuffe and store your treasure.

  _Magn._ Yet somtyme, parde, I must vse largesse.

  _Cl. Col._ Ye, mary, somtyme in a messe of vergesse,
  As in a tryfyll or in a thynge of nought,                           1780
  As gyuynge a thynge that ye neuer bought:
  It is the gyse nowe, I say, ouer all;
  Largesse in wordes, for rewardes are but small:
  To make fayre promyse, what are ye the worse?
  Let me haue the rule of your purse.

  _Magn._ I haue taken it to Largesse and Lyberte.

  _Cl. Col._ Than is it done as it sholde be:
  But vse your largesse by the aduyse of me,
  And I shall waraunt you welth and lyberte.

  _Magn._ Say on; me thynke your reasons be profounde.                1790

  _Cl. Col._ Syr, of my counsayle this shall be the grounde,
  To chose out ii. iii. of suche as you loue best,
  And let all your fansyes vpon them rest;
  Spare for no cost to gyue them pounde and peny,
  Better to make iii. ryche than for to make many;
  Gyue them more than ynoughe and let them not lacke,
  And as for all other let them trusse and packe;
  Plucke from an hundred, and gyue it to thre,
  Let neyther patent scape them nor fee;
  And where soeuer you wyll fall to a rekenynge,                      1800
  Those thre wyll be redy euen at your bekenynge,
  For then[844] shall you haue at lyberte to lowte;
  Let them haue all, and the other go without:
  Thus ioy without mesure you shall haue.

  _Magn._ Thou sayst truthe, by the harte that God me gaue!
  For, as thou sayst, ryght so shall it be:
  And here I make thé vpon Lyberte
  To be superuysour, and on Largesse also,
  For as thou wylte, so shall the game go;
  For in Pleasure, and Surueyaunce, and also in thé,                  1810
  I haue set my hole felycyte,
  And suche as you wyll shall lacke no promocyon.

  _Cl. Col._ Syr, syth that in me ye haue suche deuocyon,
  Commyttynge to me and to my felowes twayne
  Your welthe and felycyte, I trust we shall optayne
  To do you seruyce after your appetyte.

  _Magn._ In faythe, and your seruyce ryght well shall I acquyte;
  And therfore hye you hens, and take this ouersyght.

  _Cl. Col._ Nowe, Jesu preserue you, syr, prynce most of myght!

_Here goth CLOKED COLUSYON awaye, and leueth MAGNYFYCENCE alone in the
place._

  _Magn._ Thus, I say, I am enuyronned with solace;                   1820
  I drede no dyntes of fatall desteny.
  Well were that lady myght stande in my grace,
  Me to enbrace and loue moost specyally:
  A Lorde, so I wolde halse her hartely,
  So I wolde clepe her, so I wolde kys her swete!

_Here cometh in FOLY._

  _Fol._ Mary, Cryst graunt ye catche no colde on your fete!

  _Magn._ Who is this?

  _Fol._ Consayte, syr, your owne man.

  _Magn._ What tydynges with you, syr? I befole thy brayne pan.

  _Fol._ By our lakyn, syr, I haue ben a hawkyng[845] for the wylde
           swan.                                                      1830
  My hawke is rammysshe, and it happed that she ran,
  Flewe I sholde say, in to an olde barne,
  To reche at a rat, I coude not her warne;
  She pynched her pynyon, by God, and catched harme:
  It was a ronner; nay, fole, I warant her blode warme.

  _Magn._ A, syr, thy iarfawcon and thou be hanged togyder!

  _Fol._ And, syr, as I was comynge to you hyder,
  I sawe a fox sucke on a kowes ydder,
  And with a lyme rodde I toke them bothe togyder.
  I trowe it be a frost, for the way is slydder:                      1840
  Se, for God auowe, for colde as I chydder.

  _Magn._ Thy wordes hange togyder as fethers in the wynde.

  _Fol._ A, syr, tolde I not you howe I dyd fynde
  A knaue and a carle, and all of one kynde?
  I sawe a wethercocke wagge with the wynde;
  Grete meruayle I had, and mused in my mynde;
  The houndes ranne before, and the hare behynde;
  I sawe a losell lede a lurden, and they were bothe blynde;
  I sawe a sowter go to supper or euer he had dynde.

  _Magn._ By Cockes harte, thou arte a fyne mery knaue.               1850

  _Fol._ I make God auowe, ye wyll none other men[846] haue.

  _Magn._ What sayst thou?

  _Fol._ Mary, I pray God your maystershyp to saue:
  I shall gyue you a gaude of a goslynge that I gaue,
  The gander and the gose bothe grasynge on one graue;
  Than Rowlande the reue ran, and I began to raue,
  And with a brystell of a bore his berde dyd I shaue.

  _Magn._ If euer I herde syke another, God gyue me shame.

  _Fol._ Sym Sadylgose was my syer, and Dawcocke my dame:
  I coude, and I lyst, garre you laughe at a game,                    1860
  Howe a wodcocke wrastled with a larke that was lame:
  The bytter sayd boldly that they were to blame;
  The feldfare wolde haue fydled, and it wolde not frame;
  The crane and the curlewe therat gan to grame;
  The snyte snyueled in the snowte and smyled at the game.

  _Magn._ Cockes bones, herde you euer suche another?

  _Fol._ Se, syr, I beseche you, Largesse my brother.

_Here FANSY cometh in._

  _Magn._ What tydynges with you, syr, that you loke so sad?

  _Fan._ When ye knowe that I knowe, ye wyll not be glad.

  _Fol._ What, brother braynsyke, how farest thou?                    1870

  _Magn._ Ye, let be thy iapes, and tell me howe
  The case requyreth.

  _Fan._ Alasse, alasse, an heuy metynge!
  I wolde tell you, and yf I myght for wepynge.

  _Fol._ What, is all your myrthe nowe tourned to sorowe?
  Fare well tyll sone, adue tyll to morowe.

_Here goth FOLY away._

  _Magn._ I pray thé, Largesse, let be thy sobbynge.

  _Fan._ Alasse, syr, ye are vndone with stelyng and robbynge!
  Ye sent vs a superuysour for to take hede:
  Take hede of your selfe, for nowe ye haue nede.                     1880

  _Magn._ What, hath Sadnesse begyled me so?

  _Fan._ Nay, madnesse hath begyled you and many mo;
  For Lyberte is gone and also Felycyte.

  _Magn._ Gone? alasse, ye haue vndone me!

  _Fan._ Nay, he that ye sent vs, Clokyd Colusyon,
  And your payntyd Pleasure, Courtly Abusyon,
  And your demenour with Counterfet Countenaunce,
  And your suruayour,[847] Crafty Conueyaunce,
  Or euer we were ware brought vs in aduersyte,
  And had robbyd you quyte from all felycyte.                         1890

  _Magn._ Why, is this the largesse that I haue vsyd?

  _Fan._ Nay, it was your fondnesse that ye haue vsyd.

  _Magn._ And is this the credence that I gaue to the letter?

  _Fan._ Why, coulde not your wyt serue you no better?

  _Magn._ Why, who wolde haue thought in you suche gyle?

  _Fan._ What? yes, by the rode, syr, it was I all this whyle
  That you trustyd, and Fansy is my name;
  And Foly, my broder, that made you moche game.

_Here cometh in ADUERSYTE._

  _Magn._ Alas, who[848] is yonder, that grymly lokys?

  _Fan._ Adewe, for I wyll not come in his clokys.[849]               1900

  _Magn._ Lorde, so my flesshe trymblyth nowe for drede!

_Here MAGNYFYCENCE is beten downe, and spoylyd from all his goodys and
rayment._

  _Aduer._ I am Aduersyte, that for thy mysdede
  From God am sent to quyte thé thy mede.
  Vyle velyarde, thou must not nowe my dynt withstande,
  Thou must not abyde the dynt of my hande:
  Ly there, losell, for all thy pompe and pryde;
  Thy pleasure now with payne and trouble shalbe tryde.
  The stroke of God, Aduersyte I hyght;
  I pluke downe kynge, prynce, lorde, and knyght,
  I rushe at them rughly, and make them ly full lowe,                 1910
  And in theyr moste truste I make them ouerthrowe.
  Thys losyll was a lorde, and lyuyd at his lust,
  And nowe, lyke a lurden, he lyeth in the dust:
  He knewe not hymselfe, his harte was so hye;
  Nowe is there no man that wyll set by hym a flye:
  He was wonte to boste, brage, and to brace;
  Nowe dare he not for shame loke one in the face:
  All worldly welth for hym to lytell was;
  Nowe hath he ryght nought, naked as an asse:
  Somtyme without measure he trusted in golde,                        1920
  And now without mesure he shal haue hunger and colde.
  Lo, syrs, thus I handell them all
  That folowe theyr fansyes in foly to fall:
  Man or woman, of what estate they be,
  I counsayle them beware of Aduersyte.
  Of sorowfull seruauntes I haue many scores:
  I vysyte them somtyme with blaynes and with sores;
  With botches and carbuckyls in care I them knyt;
  With the gowte I make them to grone where they syt;
  Some I make lyppers and lazars full horse;                          1930
  And from that they loue best some I deuorse;
  Some with the marmoll to halte I them make;
  And some to cry out of the bone ake;
  And some I vysyte with brennynge of fyre;
  Of some I wrynge of the necke lyke a wyre;
  And some I make in a rope to totter and walter;
  And some for to hange themselfe in an halter;
  And some I vysyte to[850] batayle, warre, and murther,
  And make eche man to sle other;
  To drowne or to sle themselfe with a knyfe;                         1940
  And all is for theyr vngracyous lyfe.
  Yet somtyme I stryke where is none offence,
  Bycause I wolde proue men of theyr pacyence.
  But, nowe a dayes, to stryke I haue grete cause,
  Lydderyns so lytell set by Goddes lawes.
  Faders and moders, that be neclygent,
  And suffre theyr chyldren to haue theyr entent,
  To gyde them vertuously that wyll not remembre,
  Them or theyr chyldren ofte tymes I dysmembre;
  Theyr chyldren, bycause that they haue no mekenesse;                1950
  I vysyte theyr faders and moders with sekenesse;
  And yf I se therby they wyll not amende,
  Then myschefe sodaynly I them sende;
  For there is nothynge that more dyspleaseth God
  Than from theyr chyldren to spare the rod
  Of correccyon, but let them haue theyr wyll;
  Some I make lame, and some I do kyll;
  And some[851] I stryke with a franesy;
  Of some of theyr chyldren I stryke out the eye;
  And where the fader by wysdom worshyp hath wonne,                   1960
  I sende ofte tymes a fole to his sonne.
  Wherfore of Aduersyte loke ye be ware,
  For when I come, comyth sorowe and care:
  For I stryke lordys of realmes and landys,
  That rule not by mesure that they haue in theyr handys,
  That sadly rule not theyr howsholde men;
  I am Goddys preposytour, I prynt them with a pen;
  Because of theyr neglygence and of theyr wanton vagys,
  I vysyte them and stryke them with many sore plagys.
  To take, syrs, example of that I you tell,                          1970
  And beware of aduersyte by my counsell,
  Take hede of this caytyfe that lyeth here on grounde;
  Beholde, howe Fortune of[852] hym hath frounde!
  For though we shewe you this in game and play,
  Yet it proueth eyrnest, ye may se, euery day.
  For nowe wyll I from this caytyfe go,
  And take myscheffe and vengeaunce of other mo,
  That hath deseruyd it as well as he.
  Howe, where art thou? come hether, Pouerte;
  Take this caytyfe to thy lore.                                      1980

_Here cometh in POUERTE._[853]

  _Pouer._ A, my bonys ake, my lymmys be sore;
  Alasse, I haue the cyatyca full euyll in my hyppe!
  Alasse, where is youth that was wont for to skyppe?
  I am lowsy, and vnlykynge, and full of scurffe,
  My colour is tawny, colouryd as a turffe:
  I am Pouerte, that all men doth hate,
  I am baytyd with doggys at euery mannys gate;
  I am raggyd and rent, as ye may se;
  Full fewe but they haue enuy at me.
  Nowe must I this carcasse lyft vp:                                  1990
  He dynyd with delyte, with Pouerte he must sup.
  Ryse vp, syr, and welcom vnto me.

_Hic accedat ad levandum MAGNYFYCENCE, et locabit eum super locum
stratum._

  _Magn._ Alasse, where is nowe my golde and fe?
  Alasse, I say, where to am I brought?
  Alasse, alasse, alasse, I dye for thought!

  _Pouer._ Syr, all this wolde haue bene thought on before:
  He woteth not what welth is that neuer was sore.

  _Magn._ Fy, fy, that euer I sholde be brought in this snare!
  I wenyd ones neuer to haue knowen of care.

  _Pouer._ Lo, suche is this worlde! I fynde it wryt,                 2000
  In welth to beware, and that is wyt.

  _Magn._ In welth to beware, yf I had had grace,
  Neuer had I bene brought in this case.

  _Pouer._ Nowe, syth it wyll no nother be,
  All that God sendeth, take it in gre;
  For, thoughe you were somtyme a noble estate,
  Nowe must you lerne to begge at euery mannes gate.

  _Magn._ Alasse, that euer I sholde be so shamed!
  Alasse, that euer I Magnyfycence was named!
  Alasse, that euer I was so harde happed,                            2010
  In mysery and wretchydnesse thus to be lapped!
  Alasse, that I coude not myselfe no better gyde!
  Alasse, in my cradell that I had not dyde!

  _Pouer._ Ye, syr, ye, leue all this rage,
  And pray to God your sorowes to asswage:
  It is foly to grudge agaynst his vysytacyon.
  With harte contryte make your supplycacyon
  Vnto your Maker, that made bothe you and me,
  And, whan it pleaseth God, better may be.

  _Magn._ Alasse, I wote not what I sholde pray!                      2020

  _Pouer._ Rem[e]mbre you better, syr, beware what ye say,
  For drede ye dysplease the hygh deyte.
  Put your wyll to his wyll, for surely it is he
  That may restore you agayne to felycyte,
  And brynge you agayne out of aduersyte.
  Therfore pouerte loke pacyently ye take,
  And remembre he suffered moche more for your sake,
  Howe be it of all synne he was innocent,
  And ye haue deserued this punysshment.

  _Magn._ Alasse, with colde my lymmes shall be marde!                2030

  _Pouer._ Ye, syr, nowe must ye lerne to lye harde,
  That was wonte to lye on fetherbeddes of downe;
  Nowe must your fete lye hyer than your crowne:
  Where you were wonte to haue cawdels for your hede,
  Nowe must you monche mamockes and lumpes of brede;
  And where you had chaunges of ryche aray,
  Nowe lap you in a couerlet full fayne that you may;
  And where that ye were pomped with what that ye wolde,
  Nowe must ye suffre bothe hunger and colde:
  With courtely sylkes ye were wonte to be drawe;                     2040
  Nowe must ye lerne to lye on the strawe;
  Your skynne that was wrapped in shertes of Raynes,
  Nowe must ye be stormy beten[854] with showres and raynes;
  Your hede that was wonte to be happed moost drowpy and drowsy,
  Now shal ye be scabbed, scuruy, and lowsy.

  _Magn._ Fye on this worlde, full of trechery,
  That euer noblenesse sholde lyue thus wretchydly!

  _Pouer._ Syr, remembre the tourne of Fortunes whele,
  That wantonly can wynke, and wynche with her hele.
  Nowe she wyll laughe, forthwith she wyll frowne;                    2050
  Sodenly set vp, and sodenly pluckyd downe:
  She dawnsyth varyaunce with mutabylyte;
  Nowe all in welth, forthwith in pouerte:
  In her promyse there is no sykernesse;
  All her delyte is set in doublenesse.

  _Magn._ Alas, of Fortune I may well complayne!

  _Pouer._ Ye, syr, yesterday wyll not be callyd agayne:
  But yet, syr, nowe in this case,
  Take it mekely, and thanke God of his grace;
  For nowe go I wyll begge for you some mete;                         2060
  It is foly agaynst God for to plete;
  I wyll walke nowe with my beggers baggys,
  And happe you the whyles with these homly raggys.

_Discedendo[855] dicat ista verba._

  A, howe my lymmys be lyther and lame!
  Better it is to begge than to be hangyd with shame;
  Yet many had leuer hangyd to be,
  Then for to begge theyr mete for charyte:
  They thynke it no shame to robbe and stele,
  Yet were they better to begge a great dele;
  For by robbynge they rynne to _in manus tuas_ quecke,               2070
  But beggynge is better medecyne for the necke;
  Ye, mary, is it, ye, so mote I goo:
  A Lorde God, howe the gowte wryngeth me by the too!

_Here MAGNYFYCENCE dolorously maketh his mone._

  _Magn._ O feble fortune, O doulfull destyny!
  O hatefull happe, O carefull cruelte!
  O syghynge sorowe, O thoughtfull mysere!
  O rydlesse rewthe, O paynfull pouerte!
  O dolorous herte, O harde aduersyte!
  O odyous dystresse, O dedly payne and woo!
  For worldly shame I wax bothe wanne and bloo.                       2080
  Where is nowe my welth and my noble estate?
  Where is nowe my treasure, my landes, and my rent?
  Where is nowe all my seruauntys that I had here a late?
  Where is nowe my golde vpon them that I spent?
  Where is nowe all my ryche abylement?
  Where is nowe my kynne, my frendys, and my noble blood?
  Where is nowe all my pleasure and my worldly good?
  Alasse, my foly! alasse, my wanton wyll!
  I may no more speke, tyll I haue wept my fyll.

[_Here cometh in LYBERTE._]

  _Lyb._ With, ye mary, syrs, thus sholde it be.                      2090
  I kyst her swete, and she kyssyd me;
  I daunsed the darlynge on my kne;
  I garde her gaspe, I garde her gle,
  With, daunce on the le, the le!
  I bassed that baby with harte so free;
  She is the bote of all my bale:[856]
  A, so, that syghe was farre fet!
  To loue that louesome I wyll not let;
  My harte is holly on her set:
  I plucked her by the patlet;                                        2100
  At my deuyse I with her met;
  My fansy fayrly on her I set;
  So merely syngeth the nyghtyngale!
  In lust and lykynge my name is Lyberte:
  I am desyred with hyghest and lowest degre;
  I lyue as me lyst, I lepe out at large;
  Of erthely thynge I haue no care nor charge;
  I am presydent of prynces, I prycke them with pryde:[857]
  What is he lyuynge that lyberte wolde lacke?
  A thousande pounde with lyberte may holde no tacke;                 2110
  At lyberte a man may be bolde for to brake;
  Welthe without lyberte gothe all to wrake.
  But yet, syrs, hardely one thynge lerne of me:
  I warne you beware of to moche lyberte,
  For _totum in toto_ is not worth an hawe;
  To hardy, or to moche, to free of the dawe;
  To sober, to sad, to subtell, to wyse;
  To mery, to mad, to gyglynge, to nyse;
  To full of fansyes, to lordly, to prowde;
  To homly, to holy, to lewde, and to lowde;                          2120
  To flatterynge, to smatterynge, to to out of harre;
  To claterynge, to chaterynge, to shorte, and to farre;
  To iettynge, to iaggynge, and to full of iapes;
  To mockynge, to mowynge, to lyke a iackenapes:
  Thus _totum in toto_ groweth vp, as ye may se,
  By meanes of madnesse, and to moche lyberte;
  For I am a vertue, yf I be well vsed,
  And I am a vyce where I am abused.

  _Magn._ A, woo worthe thé, Lyberte, nowe thou sayst full trewe!
  That I vsed thé to moche, sore may I rewe.                          2130

  _Lyb._ What, a very vengeaunce, I say, who is that?
  What brothell, I say, is yonder bounde in a mat?

  _Magn._ I am Magnyfycence, that somtyme thy mayster was.

  _Lyb._ What, is the worlde thus come to passe?
  Cockes armes, syrs, wyll ye not se
  Howe he is vndone by the meanes of me?
  For yf Measure had ruled Lyberte as he began,
  This lurden that here lyeth had ben a noble man.
  But he abused so his free lyberte,
  That nowe he hath loste all his felycyte,                           2140
  Not thorowe largesse of lyberall expence,
  But by the way of fansy insolence;
  For lyberalyte is most conuenyent
  A prynce to vse with all his hole intent,
  Largely rewardynge them that haue deseruyd,
  And so shall a noble man nobly be seruyd:
  But nowe adayes as huksters they hucke and they stycke,
  And pynche at the payment of a poddynge prycke;
  A laudable largesse, I tell you, for a lorde,
  To prate for the patchynge of a pot sharde!                         2150
  Spare for the spence of a noble, that his honour myght saue,
  And spende c.s̄. for the pleasure of a knaue!
  But so longe they[858] rekyn with theyr reasons amysse,
  That they lose theyr lyberte and all that there is.

  _Magn._ Alasse, that euer I occupyed suche abusyon!

  _Lyb._ Ye, for nowe it hath brought thé to confusyon:
  For, where I am occupyed and vsyd wylfully,
  It can not contynew longe prosperyously;
  As euydently in retchlesse youth ye may se,
  Howe many come to myschefe for to moche lyberte;                    2160
  And some in the worlde theyr brayne is so ydyll,
  That they set theyr chyldren to rynne on the brydyll,
  In youth to be wanton and let them haue theyr wyll;
  And they neuer thryue in theyr age, it shall not gretly skyll:
  Some fall to foly them selfe for to spyll,
  And some fall prechynge at the Toure Hyll;
  Some hath so moche lyberte of one thynge and other,
  That nother they set by father and mother;
  Some haue so moche lyberte that they fere no synne,
  Tyll, as ye se many tymes, they shame all theyr kynne.              2170
  I am so lusty to loke on, so freshe, and so fre,
  That nonnes wyll leue theyr holynes, and ryn after me;
  Freers with foly I make them so fayne,
  They cast vp theyr obedyence to cache me agayne,
  At lyberte to wander and walke ouer all,
  That lustely they lepe somtyme theyr cloyster wall.

_Hic aliquis buccat in cornu a retro post populum._

  Yonder is a horson for me doth rechate:
  Adewe, syrs, for I thynke leyst that I come to late.[859]

  _Magn._ O good Lorde, howe longe shall I indure
  This mysery, this carefull wrechydnesse?                            2180
  Of worldly welthe, alasse, who can be sure?
  In Fortunys frendshyppe there is no stedfastnesse:
  She hath dyssayuyd me with her doublenesse.
  For to be wyse all men may lerne of me,
  In welthe to beware of herde aduersyte.

_Here cometh in CRAFTY CONUEYAUNCE, [and] CLOKED COLUSYON, with a lusty
laughter._

  _Cr. Con._ Ha, ha, ha! for laughter I am lyke to brast.

  _Cl. Col._ Ha, ha, ha! for sporte I am lyke to spewe and cast.

  _Cr. Con._ What has thou gotted in faythe to thy share?

  _Cl. Col._ In faythe, of his cofers the bottoms are bare.

  _Cr. Con._ As for his plate of syluer, and suche trasshe,           2190
  I waraunt you, I haue gyuen it a lasshe.

  _Cl. Col._ What, then he may drynke out of a stone cruyse?

  _Cr. Con._ With, ye, syr, by Jesu that slayne was with Jewes!
  He may rynse a pycher, for his plate is to wed.

  _Cl. Col._ In faythe, and he may dreme on a daggeswane for ony
               fether bed.

  _Cr. Con._ By my trouthe, we haue ryfled hym metely well.

  _Cl. Col._ Ye, but thanke me therof euery dele.

  _Cr. Con._ Thanke thé therof, in the deuyls date!

  _Cl. Col._ Leue thy pratynge, or els I shall lay thé on the pate.

  _Cr. Con._ Nay, to wrangle, I warant thé, it is but a stone caste.  2200

  _Cl. Col._ By the messe, I shall cleue thy heed to the waste.

  _Cr. Con._ Ye, wylte thou clenly cleue[860] me in the clyfte with
               thy nose?

  _Cl. Col._ I shall thrust in thé my dagger—

  _Cr. Con._ Thorowe the legge in to the hose.

  _Cl. Col._ Nay, horson, here is my gloue; take it vp, and thou dare.

  _Cr. Con._ Torde, thou arte good to be a man of warre.

  _Cl. Col._ I shall skelpe thé on the skalpe; lo, seest thou that?

  _Cr. Con._ What, wylte thou skelpe me? thou dare not loke on a gnat.

  _Cl. Col._ By Cockes bones, I shall blysse thé, and thou be to bolde.

  _Cr. Con._ Nay, then thou wylte dynge the deuyll, and thou be not
               holde.                                                 2210

  _Cl. Col._ But wottest thou, horson? I rede thé to be wyse.

  _Cr. Con._ Nowe I rede thé beware, I haue warned thé twyse.

  _Cl. Col._ Why, wenest thou that I forbere thé for thyne owne sake?

  _Cr. Con._ Peas, or I shall wrynge thy be in a brake.

  _Cl. Col._ Holde thy hande, dawe, of thy dagger, and stynt of thy dyn,
  Or I shal fawchyn thy flesshe, and scrape thé on the skyn.

  _Cr. Con._ Ye, wylte thou, ha[n]gman? I say, thou cauell!

  _Cl. Col._ Nay, thou rude rauener, rayne beten iauell!

  _Cr. Con._ What, thou Colyn cowarde, knowen and tryde!

  _Cl. Col._ Nay, thou false harted dastarde, thou dare not abyde!    2220

  _Cr. Con._ And yf there were none to dysplease but thou and I,
  Thou sholde not scape, horson, but thou sholde dye.

  _Cl. Col._ Nay, iche shall wrynge thé, horson, on the wryst.

  _Cr. Con._ Mary, I defye thy best and thy worst.

[_Here cometh in COUNTERFET COUNTENAUNCE._[861]]

  _C. Count._ What, a very vengeaunce, nede all these wordys?
  Go together by the heddys, and gyue me your swordys.

  _Cl. Col._ So he is the worste brawler that euer was borne.

  _Cr. Con._ In fayth, so to suffer thé, it is but a skorne.

  _C. Count._ Now let vs be all one, and let vs lyue in rest,
  For we be, syrs, but a fewe of the best.                            2230

  _Cl. Col._ By the masse, man, thou shall fynde me resonable.

  _Cr. Con._ In faythe, and I wyll be to reason agreable.

  _C. Count._ Then truste I to God and the holy rode,
  Here shalbe not great sheddynge of blode.

  _Cl. Col._ By our lakyn, syr, not by my wyll.

  _Cr. Con._ By the fayth that I owe to God, and I wyll syt styll.

  _C. Count._ Well sayd: but, in fayth, what was your quarell?

  _Cl. Col._ Mary, syr, this gentylman called me iauell.

  _Cr. Con._ Nay, by Saynt Mary, it was ye called me knaue.

  _Cl. Col._ Mary, so vngoodly langage you me gaue.                   2240

  _C. Count._ A, shall we haue more of this maters yet?
  Me thynke ye are not gretly acomberyd with wyt.

  _Cr. Con._ Goddys fote, I warant you, I am a gentylman borne,
  And thus to be facyd I thynke it great skorne.

  _C. Count._ I can not well tell of your dysposycyons;
  And ye be a gentylman, ye haue knauys condycyons.

  _Cl. Col._ By God, I tell you, I wyll not be out facyd.

  _Cr. Con._ By the masse, I warant thé, I wyll not be bracyd.

  _C. Count._ Tushe, tushe, it is a great defaute:
  The one of you is to proude, the other is to haute.                 2250
  Tell me brefly where vpon ye began.

  _Cl. Col._ Mary, syr, he sayd that he was the pratyer man
  Then I was, in opynynge of lockys;
  And, I tell you, I dysdayne moche of his mockys.

  _Cr. Con._ Thou sawe neuer yet but I dyd my parte,
  The locke of a caskyt to make to starte.

  _C. Count._ Nay, I know well inough ye are bothe well handyd
  To grope a gardeuyaunce, though it be well bandyd.

  _Cl. Col._ I am the better yet in a bowget.

  _Cr. Con._ And I the better in a male.                              2260

  _C. Count._ Tushe, these maters that ye moue are but soppys in ale:
  Your trymynge and tramynge by me must be tangyd,
  For, had I not bene, ye bothe had bene hangyd,
  When we with Magnyfycence goodys made cheuysaunce.

  _Magn._ And therfore our Lorde sende you a very wengaunce!

  _C. Count._ What begger art thou that thus doth banne and wary?

  _Magn._ Ye be the theuys, I say, away my goodys dyd cary.

  _Cl. Col._ Cockys bonys, thou begger, what is thy name?

  _Magn._ Magnyfycence I was, whom ye haue brought to shame.

  _C. Count._ Ye, but trowe you, syrs, that this is he?               2270

  _Cr. Con._ Go we nere, and let vs se.

  _Cl. Col._ By Cockys bonys, it is the same.

  _Magn._ Alasse, alasse, syrs, ye are to blame!
  I was your mayster, though ye thynke it skorne,
  And nowe on me ye gaure and sporne.

  _C. Count._ Ly styll, ly styll nowe, with yll hayle!

  _Cr. Con._ Ye, for thy langage can not thé auayle.

  _Cl. Col._ Abyde, syr, abyde, I shall make hym to pysse.[862]

  _Magn._ Nowe gyue me somwhat, for God sake I craue!

  _Cr. Con._ In faythe, I gyue the four quarters of a knaue.          2280

  _C. Count._ In faythe, and I bequethe hym the tothe ake.

  _Cl. Col._ And I bequethe hym the bone ake.

  _Cr. Con._ And I bequethe hym the gowte and the gyn.

  _Cl. Col._ And I bequethe hym sorowe for his syn.

  _C. Count._ And I gyue hym Crystys curse,
  With neuer a peny in his purse.

  _Cr. Con._ And I gyue hym the cowghe, the murre, and the pose.

  _Cl. Col._ Ye, for _requiem æternam_ groweth forth of his nose:
  But nowe let vs make mery and good chere.

  _C. Count._ And to the tauerne let vs drawe nere.                   2290

  _Cr. Con._ And from thens to the halfe strete,
  To get vs there some freshe mete.

  _Cl. Col._ Why, is there any store of rawe motton?

  _C. Count._ Ye, in faythe, or ellys thou arte to great a glotton.

  _Cr. Con._ But they say it is a queysy mete;
  It wyll stryke a man myscheuously in a hete.

  _Cl. Col._ In fay, man, some rybbys of the motton be so ranke,
  That they wyll fyre one vngracyously in the flanke.

  _C. Count._ Ye, and when ye come out of the shoppe,
  Ye shall be clappyd with a coloppe,                                 2300
  That wyll make you to halt and to hoppe.

  _Cr. Con._ Som be wrestyd there that they thynke on it froty dayes,
  For there be horys there at all assayes.

  _Cl. Col._ For the passyon of God, let vs go thyther![863]

  _Et cum festinatione discedant a loco._

  _Magn._ Alas, myn owne seruauntys to shew me such reproche,
  Thus to rebuke me, and haue me in dyspyght!
  So shamfully to me theyr mayster to aproche,
  That somtyme was a noble prynce of myght!
  Alasse, to lyue longer I haue no delyght!
  For to lyue in mysery it is herder than dethe:                      2310
  I am wery of the worlde, for vnkyndnesse me sleeth.

_Hic intrat DYSPARE._

  _Dys._ Dyspare is my name, that aduersyte dothe folowe:[864]
  In tyme of dystresse I am redy at hande;
  I make heuy hertys with eyen full holowe;
  Of faruent charyte I quenche out the bronde;
  Faythe and goodhope I make asyde to stonde;
  In Goddys mercy I tell them is but foly to truste;
  All grace and pyte I lay in the duste.
  What lyest thou there lyngrynge, lewdly and lothsome?
  It is to late nowe thy synnys to repent;                            2320
  Thou hast bene so waywarde, so wranglyng, and so wrothsome,
  And so fer thou arte behynde of thy rent,
  And so vngracyously thy dayes thou hast spent,
  That thou arte not worthy to loke God in the face.

  _Magn._ Nay, nay, man, I loke neuer to haue parte of his grace;
  For I haue so vngracyously my lyfe mysusyd,
  Though I aske mercy, I must nedys be refusyd.

  _Dys._ No, no, for thy synnys be so excedynge farre,
  So innumerable and so full of dyspyte,
  And agayne thy Maker thou hast made suche warre,                    2330
  That thou canst not haue neuer mercy in his syght.

  _Magn._ Alasse, my wyckydnesse, that may I wyte!
  But nowe I se well there is no better rede,
  But sygh and sorowe, and wysshe my selfe dede.

  _Dys._ Ye, ryd thy selfe, rather than this lyfe for to lede;
  The worlde waxyth wery of thé, thou lyuest to longe.

_Hic intrat MYSCHEFE._

  _Mys._ And I, Myschefe, am comyn at nede,
  Out of thy lyfe thé for to lede:
  And loke that it be not longe
  Or that thy selfe thou go honge                                     2340
  With this halter good and stronge;
  Or ellys with this knyfe cut out a tonge
  Of thy throte hole, and ryd thé out of payne:
  Thou arte not the fyrst hymselfe hath slayne.
  Lo, here is thy knyfe and a halter! and, or we go ferther,
  Spare not thy selfe, but boldly thé murder.

  _Dys._ Ye, haue done at ones without delay.

  _Magn._ Shall I my selfe hange with an halter? nay;
  Nay, rather wyll I chose to ryd me of this lyue
  In styckynge my selfe with this fayre knyfe.                        2350

_Here MAGNYFYCENCE wolde slee hymselfe with a knyfe._

  _Mys._[865] Alarum, alarum! to longe we abyde!

  _Dys._ Out, harowe, hyll burneth! where shall I me hyde?

_Hic intrat GOODHOPE, fugientibus DYSPAYRE et MYSCHEFE: repente GOODHOPE
surripiat illi gladium,[866] et dicat._

  _Good._ Alas, dere sone, sore combred is thy mynde,
  Thyselfe that thou wolde sloo agaynst nature and kynde!

  _Magn._ A, blessyd may ye be, syr! what shall I you call?

  _Good._ Goodhope, syr, my name is; remedy pryncypall
  Agaynst all sautes[867] of your goostly foo:
  Who knoweth me, hymselfe may neuer sloo.

  _Magn._ Alas, syr, so I am lapped in aduersyte,
  That dyspayre well nyghe had myscheued me!                          2360
  For, had ye riot the soner ben my refuge,
  Of dampnacyon I had ben drawen in the luge.

  _Good._ Vndoubted ye had lost yourselfe eternally:
  There is no man may synne more mortally
  Than of wanhope thrughe the vnhappy wayes,
  By myschefe to breuyate and shorten his dayes:
  But, my good sonne, lerne from dyspayre to flee,
  Wynde you from wanhope, and aquaynte you with me.
  A grete mysaduenture, thy Maker to dysplease,
  Thyselfe myscheuynge to thyne endlesse dysease!                     2370
  There was neuer so harde a storme of mysery,
  But thrughe goodhope there may come remedy.

  _Magn._ Your wordes be more sweter than ony precyous narde,
  They molefy so easely my harte that was so harde;
  There is no bawme, ne gumme of Arabe,
  More delectable than your langage to me.

  _Good._ Syr, your fesycyan is the grace of God,
  That you hath punysshed with his sharpe rod.
  Goodhope, your potecary assygned am I:
  That Goddes grace hath vexed you sharply,                           2380
  And payned you with a purgacyon of odyous pouerte,
  Myxed with bytter alowes of herde aduersyte;
  Nowe must I make you a lectuary softe,
  I to mynyster it, you to receyue it ofte,
  With rubarbe of repentaunce in you for to rest;
  With drammes of deuocyon your dyet must be drest;
  With gommes goostly of glad herte and mynde,
  To thanke God of his sonde, and comforte ye shal fynde.
  Put fro you presumpcyon and admyt humylyte,
  And hartely thanke God of your aduersyte;                           2390
  And loue that Lorde that for your loue was dede,
  Wounded from the fote to the crowne of the hede:
  For who loueth God can ayle nothynge but good;
  He may helpe you, he may mende your mode:
  Prosperyte to[868] hym is gyuen solacyusly to man,
  Aduersyte to hym therwith nowe and than;
  Helthe of body his besynesse to acheue,
  Dysease and sekenesse his conscyence to dyscryue,
  Afflyccyon and trouble to proue his pacyence,
  Contradyccyon to proue his sapyence,                                2400
  Grace of assystence his measure to declare,
  Somtyme to fall, another tyme to beware:
  And nowe ye haue had, syr, a wonderous fall,
  To lerne you hereafter for to beware withall.
  Howe say you, syr? can ye these wordys grope?

  _Magn._ Ye, syr, nowe am I armyd with goodhope,
  And sore I repent me of my wylfulnesse:
  I aske God mercy of my neglygence,[869]
  Vnder goodhope endurynge euer styll,
  Me humbly commyttynge vnto Goddys wyll.                             2410

  _Good._ Then shall you be sone delyuered from dystresse,
  For nowe I se comynge to youwarde Redresse.

_Hic intrat REDRESSE._

  _Red._ Cryst be amonge you and the Holy Goste!

  _Good._ He be your conducte, the Lorde of myghtys moste!

  _Red._ Syr, is your pacyent any thynge amendyd?

  _Good._ Ye, syr, he is sory for that he hath offendyd.

  _Red._ How fele you your selfe, my frend? how is your mynde?

  _Magn._ A wrechyd man, syr, to my Maker vnkynde.

  _Red._ Ye, but haue ye repentyd you with harte contryte?

  _Magn._ Syr, the repentaunce I haue, no man can wryte.              2420

  _Red._ And haue ye banyshed from you all dyspare?

  _Magn._ Ye, holly to goodhope I haue made my repare.

  _Good._ Questyonlesse he doth me assure
  In goodhope alway for to indure.

  _Red._ Than stande vp, syr, in Goddys name!
  And I truste to ratyfye and amende your fame.
  Goodhope, I pray you with harty affeccyon
  To sende ouer to me Sad Cyrcumspeccyon.

  _Good._ Syr, your requeste shall not be delayed.

_Et exeat._

  _Red._ Now surely, Magnyfycence, I am ryght well apayed             2430
  Of that I se you nowe in the state of grace;
  Nowe shall ye be renewyd with solace:
  Take nowe vpon you this abylyment,
  And to that I say gyue good aduysement.

_MAGNYFYCENCE accipiat indumentum._

  _Magn._ To your requeste I shall be confyrmable.

  _Red._ Fyrst,[870] I saye, with mynde fyrme and stable
  Determyne to amende all your wanton excesse,
  And be ruled by me, whiche am called Redresse:
  Redresse my name is, that lytell am I vsed
  As the worlde requyreth, but rather I am refused:                   2440
  Redresse sholde be at the rekenynge in euery accompte,
  And specyally to redresse that were out of ioynte:
  Full many thynges there be that lacketh redresse,
  The whiche were to longe nowe to expresse;
  But redresse is redlesse, and may do no correccyon.
  Nowe welcome forsoth, Sad Cyrcumspeccyon.

_Here cometh in SAD CYRCUMSPECCYON, sayenge_,

  _Sad Cyr._ Syr, after your message I hyed me hyder streyght,
  For to vnderstande your pleasure and also your mynde.

  _Red._ Syr, to accompte you the contynewe of my consayte,
  Is from aduersyte Magnyfycence to vnbynde.                          2450

  _Sad Cyr._ How fortuned you, Magnyfycence, so far to fal behynde?

  _Magn._ Syr, the longe absence of you, Sad Cyrcumspeccyon,
  Caused me of aduersyte to fall in subieccyon.

  _Red._ All that he sayth, of trouthe doth precede;
  For where sad cyrcumspeccyon is longe out of the way,
  Of aduersyte it is to stande in drede.

  _Sad Cyr._ Without fayle, syr, that is no nay;
  Cyrcumspeccyon inhateth all rennynge astray.
  But, syr, by me to rule fyrst ye began.

  _Magn._ My wylfulnesse, syr, excuse I ne can.                       2460

  _Sad Cyr._ Then ye repent you of foly in tymes past?

  _Magn._ Sothely, to repent me I haue grete cause:
  Howe be it from you I receyued a letter,[871]
  Whiche conteyned in it a specyall clause
  That I sholde vse largesse.

  _Sad Cyr._ Nay, syr, there a pause.

  _Red._ Yet let vs se this matter thorowly ingrosed.

  _Magn._ Syr, this letter ye sent to me, at Pountes was enclosed.

  _Sad Cyr._ Who brought you that letter, wote ye what he hyght?

  _Magn._ Largesse, syr, by his credence was his name.                2470

  _Sad Cyr._ This letter ye speke of, neuer dyd I wryte.

  _Red._ To gyue so hasty credence ye were moche to blame.

  _Magn._ Truth it is, syr; for after he wrought me moch shame,
  And caused me also to vse to moche lyberte,
  And made also mesure to be put fro me.

  _Red._ Then welthe with you myght in no wyse abyde.

  _Sad Cyr._ A ha! fansy and foly met with you, I trowe.

  _Red._ It wolde be founde so, yf it were well tryde.

  _Magn._ Surely my welthe with them was ouerthrow.

  _Sad Cyr._ Remembre you, therfore, howe late ye were low.           2480

  _Red._ Ye, and beware of vnhappy abusyon.

  _Sad Cyr._ And kepe you from counterfaytynge of clokyd colusyon.

  _Magn._ Syr, in goodhope I am to amende.

  _Red._ Vse not then your countenaunce for to counterfet.

  _Sad Cyr._ And from crafters and hafters I you forfende.

_Hic intrat PERSEUERAUNCE._

  _Magn._ Well, syr, after your counsell my mynde I wyll set.

  _Red._ What, brother Perceueraunce! surely well met.

  _Sad Cyr._ Ye com hether as well as can be thought.

  _Per._ I herde say that Aduersyte with Magnyfycence had fought.

  _Magn._ Ye, syr, with aduersyte I haue bene vexyd;                  2490
  But goodhope and redresse hath mendyd myne estate,
  And sad cyrcumspeccyon to me they haue annexyd.[872]

  _Red._ What this man hath sayd, perceyue ye his sentence?[873]

  _Magn._ Ye, syr, from hym my corage shall neuer flyt.

  _Sad Cyr._ Accordynge to treuth they be well deuysyd.

  _Magn._ Syrs, I am agreed to abyde your ordenaunce,
  Faythfull[874] assuraunce with good peraduertaunce.

  _Per._ Yf you be so myndyd, we be ryght glad.

  _Red._ And ye shall haue more worshyp then euer ye had.

  _Magn._ Well, I perceyue in you there is moche sadnesse,            2500
  Grauyte of counsell, prouydence, and wyt;
  Your comfortable aduyse and wyt excedyth all gladnesse.
  But frendly I wyll refrayne you ferther, or we flyt,
  Whereto were most metely my corage to knyt:
  Your myndys I beseche you here in to expresse,
  Commensynge this processe at mayster Redresse.

  _Red._ Syth vnto me formest this processe is erectyd,
  Herein I wyll aforse me to shewe you my mynde.
  Fyrst, from your magnyfycence syn must be abiectyd,
  In all your warkys more grace shall ye fynde;                       2510
  Be gentyll then of corage, and lerne to be kynde,
  For of noblenesse the chefe poynt is to be lyberall,
  So that your largesse be not to prodygall.

  _Sad Cyr._ Lyberte to a lorde belongyth of ryght,
  But wylfull waywardnesse muste walke out of the way;
  Measure of your lustys must haue the ouersyght,
  And not all the nygarde nor the chyncherde to play;
  Let neuer negarshyp your noblenesse affray;
  In your rewardys vse suche moderacyon
  That nothynge be gyuen without consyderacyon.                       2520

  _Per._ To the increse of your honour then arme you with ryght,
  And fumously adresse you with magnanymyte;
  And euer let the drede of God be in your syght;
  And knowe your selfe mortall, for all your dygnyte;
  Set not all your affyaunce in Fortune full of gyle;
  Remember this lyfe lastyth but a whyle.

  _Magn._ Redresse, in my remembraunce your lesson shall rest,
  And Sad Cyrcumspeccyon I marke in my mynde:
  But, Perseueraunce, me semyth your probleme was best;
  I shall it neuer forget nor leue it behynde,                        2530
  But hooly to perseueraunce my selfe I wyll bynde,
  Of that I haue mysdone to make a redresse,
  And with sad cyrcumspeccyon correcte my vantonnesse.

  _Red._ Vnto this processe brefly compylyd,
  Comprehendyng the worlde casuall and transytory,
  Who lyst to consyder shall neuer be begylyd,
  Yf it be regystryd well in memory;
  A playne example of worldly vaynglory,
  Howe in this worlde there is no seke[r]nesse,
  But fallyble flatery enmyxyd with bytternesse;                      2540
  Nowe well, nowe wo, nowe hy, nowe lawe degre,
  Nowe ryche, nowe pore, nowe hole, nowe in dysease,
  Nowe pleasure at large, nowe in captyuyte,
  Nowe leue, nowe lothe, now please, nowe dysplease,
  Now ebbe, now flowe, nowe increase, now dyscrease;
  So in this worlde there is no sykernesse,
  But fallyble flatery enmyxyd with bytternesse.

  _Sad Cyr._ A myrrour incleryd is this interlude,
  This lyfe inconstant for to beholde and se;
  Sodenly auaunsyd, and sodenly subdude,                              2550
  Sodenly ryches, and sodenly pouerte,
  Sodenly comfort, and sodenly aduersyte;
  Sodenly thus Fortune can bothe smyle and frowne,
  Sodenly set vp, and sodenly cast downe;
  Sodenly promotyd, and sodenly put backe,
  Sodenly cherysshyd, and sodenly cast asyde,
  Sodenly commendyd, and sodenly fynde a lacke,
  Sodenly grauntyd, and sodenly denyed,
  Sodenly hyd, and sodenly spyed;
  Sodenly thus Fortune can bothe smyle and frowne,                    2560
  Sodenly set vp, and sodenly cast downe.

  _Per._ This treatyse, deuysyd to make you dysporte,
  Shewyth nowe adayes howe the worlde comberyd is,
  To the pythe of the mater who lyst to resorte;
  To day it is well, to morowe it is all amysse,
  To day in delyte, to morowe bare of blysse,
  To day a lorde, to morowe ly in the duste;
  Thus in this worlde there is no erthly truste;
  To day fayre wether, to morowe a stormy rage,
  To day hote, to morowe outragyous colde,                            2570
  To day a yoman, to morowe made of page,
  To day in surety, to morowe bought and solde,
  To day maysterfest, to morowe he hath no holde,
  To day a man, to morowe he lyeth in the duste;
  Thus in this worlde there is no erthly truste.

  _Magn._ This mater we haue mouyd, you myrthys to make,
  Precely purposyd vnder pretence of play,
  Shewyth wysdome to them that wysdome can take,
  Howe sodenly worldly welth dothe dekay,
  How wysdom thorowe wantonnesse vanysshyth away,                     2580
  How none estate lyuynge of hymselfe can be sure,
  For the welthe of this worlde can not indure;
  Of the terestre rechery we fall in the flode,
  Beten with stormys of many a frowarde blast,
  Ensordyd with the wawys sauage and wode,
  Without our shyppe be sure, it is lykely to brast,
  Yet of magnyfycence oft made is the mast;
  Thus none estate lyuynge of hym can be sure,
  For the welthe of this worlde can not indure.

  _Red._ Nowe semyth vs syttynge that ye then resorte                 2590
  Home to your paleys with ioy and ryalte.

  _Sad Cyr._ Where euery thyng is ordenyd after your noble porte.

  _Per._ There to indeuer with all felycyte.

  _Magn._ I am content, my frendys, that it so be.

  _Red._ And ye that haue harde this dysporte and game,
  Jhesus preserue you frome endlesse wo and shame!
                            Amen.

[779] _Magnyfycence, &c._] From the ed. printed by Rastell, n. d.;—in
which the above list of characters is placed at the end of the drama.

[780] _Lyberte_] Enters, probably, towards the end of the preceding
speech.

[781] _is_] Ed. “it.”

[782] _countyth_] Ed. “countyd.”

[783] _Se_] Ed. “So.”

[784] _the dogge_] Qy. “thé, dogge?” but see notes.

[785] _after none_] Here Felycyte goes out.

[786] _sensim retrocedat; at_] Ed. “sensū _retrocedat_ ad.”

[787] _animat_] Qy. “animet?”

[788] _By your soth_] Ed. prefixes “_Fansy_” to these words, and omits
the prefix to the next speech.

[789] _intrat_] Qy. “intret?”—This stage-direction is not quite correct,
for _Count._ _Count._ enters as _Fansy_ is going off, and detains him
till v. 406.

[790] _to fyght_] Qy. “_to_ flyght”—scold (a word used elsewhere by
Skelton), or “_to_ syght?” see next line but two.

[791] _hym_] Compare v. 1275.

[792] _I counterfet, &c._] This line seems to be corrupt.

[793] _famine multo_] Ed. “famina multa.”

[794] _Sure Surueyaunce, &c._] Ed. gives this line to _C. Count._, and
the next speech to _Cr. Con._ Compare v. 652.

[795] _taste_] Qy. a line wanting to rhyme with this?

[796] _ye_] Ed. “we.”

[797] _Syr, the playnesse you tell me_] Ed. prefixes _Crafty Con._
to these words, and omits the prefix to the next line.—Qy., for the
rhyme,—“you me tell?”

[798] _But, Counterfet, &c._] Ed. omits the prefix to this speech.

[799] _Cr. Con._] Ed. “_Cl. Col._”

[800] _praty men_] Here _Fansy_, _Crafty Conueyaunce_, and _Counterfet
Conntenaunce_, go out.

[801] _exiat beretrum cronice_] Qy. “_exuat_ (or rather, _exueret_)
_barretum_ (_i. e._ pileum) _ironice?_”

[802] _batowe_] Qy. “batone?”

[803] _By Goddes fote, &c._] Here the prefixes to the speeches are surely
wrong: but as I am doubtful how they ought to be assigned, I have not
ventured to alter them. Qy.

  “_Court. Ab._ By Goddes fote, and I dare well fyght, for I wyll not
                  start.

  _Cl. Col._ Nay, thou art a man good inough but for thy false hart.

  _Court. Ab._ Well, and I be a coward, ther is mo than I.

  _Cl. Col_ Ye, in faythe, a bolde man and a hardy;
  A bolde man in a bole of newe ale in cornys.

  _Court. Ab._ Wyll ye se,” &c.

[804] _Cr. Con._] Ed. “_Cl. Col._” Compare the next line, and v. 796.

[805] _Cl. Col._] Ed. “_Court. Ab._”

[806] _ye, thou woldest_] Qy., for the rhyme, “thou woldest, ye?”

[807] _they_] i. e. _Cloked Colusyon_ and _Crafty Conueyaunce_.

[808] _Eche man take a fe_] There seems to be some corruption of the text
here.

[809] _tyll sone_] Here _Courtly Abusyon_ goes out.

[810] _crema_] If this be the right reading, I am unacquainted with the
word. It can hardly be a misprint for “cremia:” qy. “crembalum?”

[811] _eye_] Ed. “eyen.”

[812] _dogge_] Ed. “hogge.”

[813] _hogge_] Ed. “dogge.”

[814] _myne_] Qy., for the rhyme, “my purse?”

[815] _fowle_] Qy. a line wanting to rhyme with this?

[816] _Latyn_] Ed. “lutyn.”

[817] _Est snavi, &c._] Between this line and the next, ed. has
“_Versus_.”

[818] _kesteryll_] Ed. “besteryll.”

[819] _you_] Qy., for the rhyme, “_you_ there?”

[820] _Yes_] Ed. “Yet.”

[821] _for nowe thou hast lost_] Qy., for the rhyme, “for thou hast lost
nowe?”

[822] _tappet_] Ed. “tap.” Compare p. 128, v. 75.

[823] _hym_] Compare v. 427, p. 239. Perhaps these inconsistencies may
have arisen from contractions in the MS.

[824] _mo_] Ed. “more.”

[825] _wyt_] Ed. “whyt.”

[826] _slyght_] Ed. “shyfte.” Compare v. 687, p. 247, and v. 964, p. 256,
where “slyght” (sleight) is the rhyme to “consayte.”

[827] _the mare_] Here _Foly_ and _Fansy_ go out.

[828] _hungre_] Ed. “hunger.”

[829] _craue_] Qy., for the rhyme, “craued?” unless something be wanting.

[830] _kay_] Ed. “bay.”

[831] _thou_] Qy. “you?” see note on v. 1275, p. 266.

[832] _another_] Qy. “_another_ time?”

[833] _For nowe, &c._] In ed. this speech is given to _Fansy_.

[834] _that_] Ed. “the.”

[835] _be sene_] Qy., for the rhyme, “beseme?”

[836] _Cypyo_] Ed. “typyo.”

[837] _leyre_] Ed. “heyre.”

[838] _occacyon of_] Ed. “accacyon or.”

[839] _candell_] Qy. “caudell?”

[840] _ye_] Ed. “he.”

[841] _ye_] Ed. “he.”

[842] _let se, for your selfe_] Qy., for the rhyme, “for your selfe, let
se?”—unless “for your selfe” was intended to form the commencement of the
next verse.

[843] _Here Mesure goth out of the place_] To this stage-direction
ought to be added—“_with Courtly Abusyon, who, as he carries him off,
exclaims_.” See what _Clokyd Colusyon_ says a little after,

  “Cockes armes, howe Pleasure plucked hym forth!”

Pleasure is the assumed name of _Courtly Abusyon_.

[844] _then_] Qy. “them?”

[845] _hawkyng_] Ed. “howkyng.”

[846] _men_] Qy. “man?”

[847] _suruayour_] Ed. “superuysour:” compare v. 1414, p. 271; v. 652, p.
246, &c. _Cl. Col._ has just been made “superuysour:” see v. 1808, p. 284.

[848] _who_] Ed. “why.”

[849] _clokys_] Here _Fansy_ goes out.

[850] _to_] Qy. “with?” compare vv. 1927, 1934.

[851] _some_] Ed. “syme.”

[852] _of_] Qy. “on?”

[853] _Pouerte_] And _Aduersyte_ goes out.

[854] _stormy beten_] Perhaps “storm ybeten.”

[855] _Discedendo_] Ed. “Difidendo.”

[856] _bale_] Meant, perhaps, to rhyme with v. 2103.

[857] _pryde_] Qy. a line wanting to rhyme with this?

[858] _they_] Ed. “theyr.”

[859] _late_] Here _Lyberte_ goes out.

[860] _cleue_] Ed. “clene.” Compare p. 130, v. 133, and p. 194, v. 37.

[861] _Here cometh, &c._] Ed., besides omitting this stage-direction,
leaves the two following lines unappropriated.

[862] _pysse_] Qy. a line wanting to rhyme with this?

[863] _thyther_] Qy. a line wanting to rhyme with this?

[864] _folowe_] Ed. “felowe.”

[865] _Mys._] Ed. “_Magn._”

[866] _gladium_] Ed. “gladio.”

[867] _sautes_] Ed. “fautes.”

[868] _to_] Qy. “by?”

[869] _neglygence_] Qy., did Skelton write, for the rhyme, “neglygesse?”

[870] _Fyrst, &c._] Ed. leaves this speech unappropriated.

[871] _a letter_] Qy. some corruption? This line ought to rhyme with the
preceding line but one.

[872] _annexyd_] Ed. “amexyd.”

[873] _sentence_] Qy. some corruption? This line ought to rhyme with the
preceding line but one.

[874] _Faythfull_] Ed. “Faythfully.”

  I[895] purpose to shake oute                                          50
  All my connyng bagge,
  Lyke a clerkely hagge;
  For though my ryme be ragged,
  Tattered and iagged,
  Rudely rayne beaten,
  Rusty and moughte[896] eaten,
  If ye[897] take well therwith,
  It hath in it some pyth.
  For, as farre as I can se,
  It is wronge with eche degre:                                         60
  For the temporalte
  Accuseth the spiritualte;
  The spirituall[898] agayne
  Dothe grudge and complayne
  Vpon the[899] temporall men:
  Thus eche of other blother[900]
  The tone agayng[901] the tother:
  Alas, they make me shoder!
  For in hoder moder
  The Churche is put in faute;                                          70
  The prelates ben[902] so haut,
  They say, and loke so hy,
  As though they wolde fly
  Aboue the sterry skye.
    Laye men say indede
  How they take no[903] hede
  Theyr sely shepe to fede,
  But plucke away and pull
  The fleces of theyr[904] wull,
  Vnethes[905] they leue a locke                                        80
  Of wull amonges[906] theyr[907] flocke;
  And as for theyr connynge,
  A glommynge and a mummynge,
  And make therof a iape;
  They gaspe and they gape
  All to haue promocyon,
  There is theyr hole[908] deuocyon,
  With money, if it wyll hap,
  To catche the[909] forked cap:
  Forsothe they are to[910] lewd                                        90
  To say so, all beshrewd!
    What trow ye they say more
  Of the bysshoppes lore?
  How in matters they be rawe,
  They lumber forth[911] the lawe,
  To herken[912] Jacke and Gyll,
  Whan they put vp a byll,
  And iudge it[913] as they wyll,
  For other mennes skyll,
  Expoundyng out theyr clauses,                                        100
  And leue theyr owne causes:
  In theyr prouynciall[914] cure
  They make but lytell sure,
  And meddels[915] very lyght
  In the Churches[916] ryght;
  But _ire_ and _venire_,
  And solfa[917] so alamyre,
  That the premenyre
  Is lyke to be set[918] a fyre
  In theyr iurisdictions[919]                                          110
  Through temporall afflictions:[920]
  Men say they haue prescriptions[921]
  Agaynst spirituall[922] contradictions,[923]
  Accomptynge them as fyctions.[924]
    And whyles the heedes do this,
  The remenaunt is amys
  Of the clergy all,
  Bothe great[925] and small.
  I wot neuer[926] how they warke,
  But thus[927] the people barke;[928]                                 120
  And surely thus they say,
  Bysshoppes, if they may,
  Small houses wolde[929] kepe,
  But slumbre forth and slepe,
  And assay to crepe
  Within the noble walles
  Of the kynges halles,
  To fat theyr bodyes full,
  Theyr soules lene[930] and dull,
  And haue full lytell care[931]                                       130
  How euyll[932] theyr shepe fare.
    The temporalyte say[933] playne,
  Howe bysshoppes dysdayne
  Sermons for to make,
  Or suche laboure to take;
  And for to say trouth,
  A great parte is for[934] slouth,
  But the greattest parte
  Is for[935] they haue but small arte
  And ryght sklender[936] connyng                                      140
  Within theyr heedes wonnyng.
  But this reason they take
  How they are able to make
  With theyr golde and treasure
  Clerkes out of[937] measure,
  And yet that is a pleasure.
  Howe be it some there be,
  Almost two or thre,
  Of that dygnyte,
  Full worshypfull clerkes,                                            150
  As[938] appereth by theyr werkes,
  Lyke Aaron and Ure,
  The wolfe from the dore
  To werryn[939] and to kepe
  From theyr goostly shepe,
  And theyr[940] spirituall lammes
  Sequestred from rammes
  And from the[941] berded gotes
  With theyr heery cotes;
  Set nought by golde ne grotes,                                       160
  Theyr names if I durst tell.
    But they are[942] loth to mell,
  And loth to hang the bell
  Aboute the cattes necke,
  For drede to haue a checke;
  They ar fayne to play deuz decke,[943]
  They ar made[944] for the becke.
  How be it they are good men,
  Moche[945] herted lyke an hen:
  Theyr lessons forgotten they haue                                    170
  That Becket them[946] gaue:
  Thomas _manum mittit ad fortia,_
  _Spernit damna, spernit opprobria,_
  _Nulla Thomam frangit injuria_.
  But nowe euery spirituall father,
  Men say, they[947] had rather
  Spende moche[948] of theyr share
  Than to be combred with care:
  Spende! nay, nay,[949] but spare;
  For let se who that[950] dare                                        180
  Sho the mockysshe mare;
  They make her wynche and keke,
  But it is not[951] worth a leke:
  Boldnesse is to seke
  The Churche[952] for to defend.
  Take me as I intende,
  For lothe[953] I am to offende
  In this that I haue pende:
  I tell you as men say;
  Amende whan[954] ye may,                                             190
  For, _usque ad montem Sare_,[955]
  Men say ye can not appare;[956]
  For some say ye hunte in[957] parkes,
  And hauke on hobby larkes,
  And other wanton warkes,
  Whan the nyght darkes.
    What hath lay men to[958] do
  The gray gose[959] for to sho?
  Lyke houndes of hell,
  They crye and they yell,                                             200
  Howe that ye[960] sell
  The grace of the Holy Gost:
  Thus they make theyr bost
  Through owte[961] euery cost,
  Howe some of you do eate
  In Lenton season[962] fleshe mete,
  Fesauntes, partryche, and cranes;
  Men call you therfor prophanes;
  Ye pycke no shrympes nor[963] pranes,
  Saltfysshe, stocfysshe, nor[964] heryng,                             210
  It is not for your werynge;
  Nor in holy Lenton[965] season
  Ye[966] wyll netheyr benes ne peason,
  But ye loke to be let lose[967]
  To a pygge[968] or to a gose,
  Your gorge not endewed
  Without a capon stewed,
  Or a stewed cocke,
  To knowe[969] whate ys a clocke
  Vnder her surfled[970] smocke,                                       220
  And her wanton wodicocke.
    And howe whan ye[971] gyue orders
  In your prouinciall borders,
  As at _Sitientes_,[972]
  Some are _insufficientes_,[973]
  Some _parum sapientes_,
  Some _nihil intelligentes_,
  Some _valde negligentes_,
  Some _nullum sensum habentes_,
  But bestiall[974] and vntaught;[975]                                 230
  But whan thei haue ones caught
  _Dominus vobiscum_ by the hede,
  Than renne they in euery stede,
  God wot, with dronken nolles;
  Yet take they[976] cure[977] of soules,
  And woteth neuer[978] what thei rede,
  Paternoster, Ave,[979] nor Crede;
  Construe not worth a whystle
  Nether Gospell nor Pystle;
  Theyr mattyns madly sayde,                                           240
  Nothynge deuoutly prayde;
  Theyr lernynge is so small,[980]
  Theyr prymes[981] and houres fall
  And lepe[982] out of theyr lyppes
  Lyke sawdust or drye chyppes.
  I speke not nowe of all,
  But the moost parte in[983] generall.
  Of suche vagabundus[984]
  Speketh _totus mundus_;
  Howe some synge _Lætabundus_                                         250
  At euery ale stake,
  With, welcome hake and make!
  By the brede that God brake,
  I am sory[985] for your sake.
  I speke not of the[986] good[987] wyfe,
  But of theyr apostles[988] lyfe;
  _Cum ipsis[989] vel illis_
  _Qui manent in villis_
  _Est uxor vel ancilla_,
  Welcome Jacke and Gylla!                                             260
  My prety Petronylla,
  And you wyll[990] be stylla,
  You shall haue your wylla.
  Of suche Paternoster pekes
  All the worlde spekes.
    In you the faute is supposed,
  For that they are not apposed
  By iust[991] examinacyon
  In connyng and[992] conuérsacyon;
  They haue none instructyon                                           270
  To make a true[993] constructyon:
  A preest without a[994] letter,
  Without his vertue be gretter,
  Doutlesse were[995] moche[996] better
  Vpon hym for to take
  A mattocke or a rake.
  Alas, for very shame!
  Some can not declyne their[997] name;
  Some can not scarsly[998] rede,
  And yet he[999] wyll not drede                                       280
  For to kepe a cure,
  And in nothyng is sure;
  This _Dominus vobiscum_,
  As wyse as Tom a thrum,[1000]
  A chaplayne of trust
  Layth all in the dust.
    Thus I, Colyn Cloute,
  As I go aboute,
  And wandrynge as I walke,
  I here the people talke.                                             290
  Men say, for syluer[1001] and golde
  Myters are bought and solde;
  There[1002] shall no clergy appose
  A myter nor[1003] a crose,
  But a full purse:
  A strawe for Goddes curse!
  What are they[1004] the worse?
  For a symonyake
  Is[1005] but a hermoniake;[1006]
  And no more ye[1007] make                                            300
  Of symony, men say,
  But a chyldes play.
    Ouer this,[1008] the foresayd laye
  Reporte[1009] howe the Pope may
  An[1010] holy anker call
  Out of the stony[1011] wall,
  And hym a bysshopp make,
  If he on hym dare[1012] take
  To kepe so harde a rule,
  To ryde vpon a mule                                                  310
  With golde all betrapped,
  In purple and paule belapped;
  Some hatted and some capped,
  Rychely and warme[1013] bewrapped,[1014]
  God wot to theyr great paynes,
  In rotchettes of fyne Raynes,
  Whyte as morowes[1015] mylke;
  Theyr tabertes of fyne silke,
  Theyr styrops of myxt gold begared;[1016]
  There may no cost be spared;                                         320
  Theyr moyles[1017] golde dothe eate;
  Theyr neyghbours dye for meate.
    What care they though Gil sweate,
  Or[1018] Jacke of the Noke?
  The pore people they yoke[1019]
  With sommons[1020] and citacyons
  And excommunycacyons,[1021]
  About churches[1022] and market:
  The bysshop on his carpet
  At home full softe dothe syt.                                        330
  This is a farly[1023] fyt,
  To here the people iangle,
  Howe warely[1024] they wrangle:
  Alas, why do ye not handle
  And them all to-mangle?[1025]
  Full[1026] falsely on you they lye,
  And[1027] shamefully you ascrye,
  And say as vntruely,[1028]
  As the[1029] butterflye
  A man myght[1030] saye in mocke                                      340
  Ware the[1031] wethercocke
  Of the steple of Poules;
  And thus they hurte theyr soules
  In sclaunderyng[1032] you for[1033] truthe:
  Alas, it is great ruthe!
  Some say ye syt in trones,
  Lyke prynces[1034] _aquilonis_,
  And shryne your rotten bones
  With perles[1035] and precyous stones;
  But howe the commons grones,                                         350
  And the people mones[1036]
  For prestes and for lones
  Lent and neuer payd,
  But from day to day delayde,
  The commune welth decayde,
  Men say ye are tonge tayde,[1037]
  And therof speke[1038] nothynge
  But dyssymulyng and glosyng.
  Wherfore men be[1039] supposyng
  That ye gyue shrewd counsell                                         360
  Agaynst the commune well,
  By poollynge and pyllage
  In cytyes and vyllage,
  By taxyng and tollage,[1040]
  Ye make[1041] monkes to[1042] haue the culerage
  For couerynge of an olde cottage,
  That commytted[1043] is a collage
  In the charter of dottage,
  _Tenure par seruyce[1044] de sottage_,
  And not _par seruyce de socage_,                                     370
  After olde seygnyours,
  And the lerning of Lytelton tenours:
  Ye haue so ouerthwarted,
  That good lawes are subuerted,
  And good reason peruerted.
    Relygous men are fayne
  For to tourne[1045] agayne
  _In[1046] secula seculorum_,
  And to forsake[1047] theyr corum,
  And _vagabundare per forum_,                                         380
  And take a fyne _meritorum_,
  _Contra regulam morum,_
  _Aut_ blacke _monachorum,_
  _Aut canonicorum,_
  _Aut Bernardinorum,_
  _Aut crucifixorum_,
  And to synge from place to place,
  Lyke apostataas.
    And the selfe same game
  Begone ys[1048] nowe with shame                                      390
  Amongest[1049] the sely nonnes:
  My lady nowe[1050] she ronnes,
  Dame Sybly[1051] our abbesse,
  Dame Dorothe and lady Besse,
  Dame Sare[1052] our pryoresse,
  Out of theyr[1053] cloyster and quere
  With an heuy chere,
  Must cast vp theyr blacke vayles,
  And set vp theyr fucke sayles,
  To catch wynde with their ventales—                                  400
  What, Colyne,[1054] there thou shales!
  Yet thus with yll hayles
  The lay fee[1055] people rayles.
    And all the fawte[1056] they lay
  On you, prelates,[1057] and say
  Ye do them wrong[1058] and no ryght
  To put them thus to flyght;
  No matyns at mydnyght,
  Boke and chalys gone quyte;
  And[1059] plucke awaye the leedes                                    410
  Evyn[1060] ouer theyr heedes,
  And sell away theyr belles,
  And all that they[1061] haue elles:
  Thus the people telles,
  Rayles lyke[1062] rebelles,
  Redys[1063] shrewdly and spelles,
  And with foundacyons[1064] melles,
  And talkys[1065] lyke tytyuelles,
  Howe ye brake the dedes[1066] wylles,
  Turne monasteris into[1067] water milles,                            420
  Of an abbay ye[1068] make a graunge;
  Your workes,[1069] they saye, are straunge;
  So that theyr founders soules
  Haue lost theyr beade rolles,
  The mony for theyr masses
  Spent[1070] amonge wanton lasses;
  The _Diriges_ are[1071] forgotten;
  Theyr founders lye there rotten,
  But where[1072] theyr soules dwell,
  Therwith I wyll not mell.                                            430
  What coulde[1073] the Turke do more
  With all his false[1074] lore,
  Turke, Sarazyn,[1075] or Jew?
  I reporte me to you,
  O mercyfull Jesu,
  You supporte and rescue,[1076]
  My style for to dyrecte,
  It may take some effecte!
  For I abhorre to wryte
  Howe the lay fee dyspyte                                             440
  You prelates, that of ryght
  Shulde be lanternes of lyght.
  Ye lyue, they say, in delyte,
  Drowned _in deliciis,_
  _In gloria et divitiis,_
  _In admirabili honore,[1077]_
  _In gloria, et splendore_
  _Fulgurantis hastæ,[1078]_
  _Viventes parum caste_:
  Yet swete meate hath soure sauce,                                    450
  For after _gloria,[1079] laus_,
  Chryst by cruelte
  Was nayled vpon[1080] a tre;
  He payed a bytter pencyon
  For mannes redemcyon,
  He dranke eysell and gall
  To redeme vs withall;
  But swete ypocras ye drynke,
  With, Let the cat wynke!
  Iche wot what eche[1081] other thynk;                                460
  Howe be it _per assimile_
  Some men thynke that ye
  Shall haue penalte[1082]
  For your iniquyte.
  _Nota_[1083] what I say,
  And bere it well away;
  If it please not theologys,[1084]
  It is good for astrologys;[1085]
  For Ptholome tolde me
  The sonne somtyme to be                                              470
  _In Ariete_,
  Ascendent a degre,[1086]
  Whan Scorpion descendynge,
  Was so then[1087] pretendynge
  A fatall fall of one[1088]
  That shuld[1089] syt on[1090] a trone,
  And rule all thynges[1091] alone.
  Your teth whet on this bone
  Amongest[1092] you euerychone,
  And let Collyn Cloute haue none[1093]                                480
  Maner of cause to mone:
  Lay salue to your owne sore,
  For els, as I sayd before,
  After _gloria_, _laus_,
  May come a soure sauce;
  Sory therfore am I,
  But trouth can neuer lye.
    With language thus poluted
  Holy Churche is bruted
  And shamfully confuted.                                              490
  My penne nowe wyll I sharpe,
  And wrest vp my harpe
  With sharpe twynkyng trebelles,
  Agaynst all suche rebelles
  That laboure to confounde
  And bryng the Churche to the grounde;
  As ye may dayly se
  Howe the lay fee
  Of one affynyte
  Consent and agre                                                     500
  Agaynst the Churche to be,
  And the dygnyte
  Of the bysshoppes see.[1094]
    And eyther ye be to bad,
  Or els they ar mad
  Of this to reporte:
  But, vnder your supporte,
  Tyll my dyenge day
  I shall bothe wryte and say,
  And ye shall do the same,                                            510
  Howe they are to[1095] blame
  You thus to dyffame:
  For it maketh me sad
  Howe that the people[1096] are glad
  The Churche to depraue;
  And some there are that raue,
  Presumynge on theyr wyt,[1097]
  Whan there is neuer a whyt,
  To maynteyne argumentes
  Agaynst the sacramentes.                                             520
    Some make epylogacyon
  Of hyghe predestynacyon;[1098]
  And of resydeuacyon[1099]
  They make interpretacyon
  Of an aquarde facyon;
  And of the prescience
  Of dyuyne essence;[1100]
  And what ipostacis[1101]
  Of Christes manhode is.
  Suche logyke men wyll chop,                                          530
  And in theyr fury hop,
  When the good ale sop
  Dothe daunce in theyr fore top;
  Bothe women and men,
  Suche ye may well knowe and ken,
  That agaynst[1102] preesthode
  Theyr malyce sprede abrode,
  Raylynge haynously
  And dysdaynously
  Of preestly dygnytes,                                                540
  But theyr malygnytes.
    And some haue a smacke
  Of Luthers sacke,
  And a brennyng sparke
  Of Luthers warke,[1103]
  And are somewhat suspecte
  In Luthers secte;
  And some of them barke,[1104]
  Clatter and carpe
  Of that heresy arte,                                                 550
  Called Wicleuista,[1105]
  The deuelysshe dogmatista;
  And some be Hussyans,
  And some be Arryans,
  And some be Pollegians,
  And make moche varyans
  Bytwene the clergye
  And the temporaltye,
  Howe the Church[1106] hath to mykel,
  And they haue to lytell,                                             560
  And bryng in[1107] materialites[1108]
  And qualyfyed qualytes
  Of pluralytes,
  Of tryalytes,
  And of tot quottes,
  They commune lyke sottes,[1109]
  As commeth to theyr lottes;
  Of prebendaries and deanes,

  And gathereth[1110] vp the store                                     570
  For to catche more and more;
  Of persons and vycaryes
  They make many outcryes;
  They cannot kepe theyr wyues
  From them for theyr lyues;
  And thus the loselles stryues,
  And lewdely sayes by[1111] Christ
  Agaynst the sely preest.
  Alas, and well away,
  What ayles[1112] them thus to say?                                   580
  They mought[1113] be better aduysed[1114]
  Then to be so[1115] dysgysed:
  But they haue enterprysed,
  And shamfully surmysed,
  Howe prelacy[1116] is solde and bought,
  And come vp of nought;
  And where the[1117] prelates be
  Come[1118] of lowe degre,
  And set in[1119] maieste
  And spirituall dyngnyte,                                             590
  Farwell benygnyte,
  Farwell symplicite,[1120]
  Farwell humylyte,
  Farwell good charyte!
    Ye[1121] are so puffed wyth pryde,
  That no man may abyde
  Your hygh and lordely lokes:
  Ye cast vp then[1122] your bokes,
  And vertue is forgotten;
  For then ye wyll be wroken                                           600
  Of euery lyght quarell,
  And call a lorde a[1123] iauell,
  A knyght a knaue ye[1124] make;
  Ye bost, ye face, ye crake,
  And vpon you ye[1125] take
  To rule bothe[1126] kynge and kayser;
  And yf ye[1127] may haue layser,
  Ye wyll[1128] brynge all to nought,
  And that is all[1129] your thought:
  For the lordes temporall,                                            610
  Theyr rule is very small,
  Almost nothyng at all.
  Men saye howe ye[1130] appall
  The[1131] noble blode royall:
  In ernest and in game,
  Ye are the lesse to blame,
  For lordes of noble blode,
  If they well vnderstode[1132]
  How connyng myght them auaunce,[1133]
  They wold pype you another[1134] daunce:                             620
  But noble men borne
  To lerne they haue scorne,[1135]
  But hunt[1136] and blowe an horne,
  Lepe ouer[1137] lakes and dykes,
  Set nothyng by[1138] polytykes;
  Therfore ye kepe them bace,
  And mocke them to[1139] theyr face:
  This is a pyteous case,
  To you that ouer[1140] the whele
  Grete[1141] lordes must crouche[1142] and knele,                     630
  And breke theyr hose at the kne,
  As dayly men may se,
  And to remembraunce call,[1143]
  Fortune so turneth the ball
  And ruleth so ouer all,
  That honoure hath a great fall.
    Shall I tell you[1144] more? ye, shall.
  I am loth to tell all;
  But the communalte yow[1145] call
  Ydolles of Babylon,                                                  640
  _De terra_ Zabulon,
  _De terra_ Neptalym;
  For ye[1146] loue to go trym,
  Brought vp of poore estate,
  Wyth pryde inordinate,
  Sodaynly vpstarte
  From the donge carte,
  The mattocke[1147] and the shule,[1148]
  To reygne and to rule;
  And haue[1149] no grace to thynke                                    650
  Howe ye[1150] were wonte to drynke
  Of a lether bottell
  With a knauysshe stoppell,
  Whan mamockes was your meate,
  With moldy[1151] brede to eate;
  Ye cowde[1152] none other gete
  To chewe and to gnawe,
  To fyll therwith your mawe;
  Loggyng in fayre[1153] strawe,
  Couchyng your drousy heddes                                          660
  Somtyme in lousy beddes.[1154]
  Alas, this is out[1155] of mynde!
  Ye growe nowe out of kynde:
  Many one ye haue vntwynde,[1156]
  And made[1157] the commons blynde.
  But _qui se[1158] existimat stare_,
  Let hym well beware[1159]
  Lest that his fote slyp,
  And haue suche a tryp,
  And falle[1160] in suche dekay,                                      670
  That all the worlde may[1161] say,
  Come downe, in[1162] the deuyll[1163] way!
    Yet, ouer all that,[1164]
  Of bysshops they[1165] chat,
  That though ye round your hear
  An ynche aboue your ear,
  And haue[1166] _aures patentes_
  And _parum intendentes_,
  And your tonsors be croppyd,[1167]
  Your eares they be[1168] stopped;                                    680
  For maister _Adulator_,
  And doctour _Assentator_,
  And _Blandior blandiris_,
  With _Mentior mentiris_,
  They folowe[1169] your desyres,
  And so they blere your eye,
  That ye can not espye
  Howe the male dothe wrye.[1170]
    Alas, for Goddes wyll,
  Why syt ye, prelates,[1171] styll,                                   690
  And suffre all this yll?

  Of[1174] your spirituall charge,
  And com forthe[1175] at large,

  In pullpettes[1176] awtentyke,[1177]

  And hys[1190] textes grounde,
  His benefyce worthe ten pounde,

  As I knowe a parte,
  Some maisters of arte,

  That wolde it shulde be[1198] noted
  Howe scripture shulde be coted,
  And so clerkley[1199] promoted;
  And yet the frere doted.
    But men sey your awtoryte,[1200]                                   760
  And your noble se,[1201]

  Shulde be imprynted better
  Then all[1203] the freres letter;
  For if ye wolde take payne

  With clauses two or thre,
  So as they myght be

  Doctors that lerned be,
  Nor bachelers of that faculte
  That hath[1220] taken degre
  In the vniuersite,
  Shall not be obiecte at by[1221] me.
    But doctour Bullatus,

  At the brode gatus,[1222]                                            800
  Doctour Daupatus,
  And bacheler _bacheleratus_,[1223]
  Dronken as a mouse,
  At the[1224] ale house,
  Taketh[1225] his pyllyon and his cap[1226]
  At the good ale tap,
  For lacke of good wyne;

  As wyse as Waltoms calfe,
  Must preche, a Goddes halfe,
  In the pulpyt solempnely;
  More mete in the[1229] pyllory,
  For, by saynt Hyllary,

  Of logyke nor[1230] scole matter,
  Neyther _syllogisare_,[1231]

  And yet he wyll mell[1235]

  And wyll preche and tell

  And he dare not well neuen[1236]
  What they do in heuen,
  Nor[1237] how farre Temple barre is
  From the seuen starrys.[1238]
    Nowe wyll I[1239] go                                               830
  And tell of other mo,

  _De non impugnando_
  The foure ordores of fryers,[1240]
  Though[1241] some of them be lyers;
  As Lymyters at large
  Wyll charge and dyscharge;
  As many a frere, God wote,
  Preches[1242] for his grote,
  Flatterynge[1243] for a newe cote                                    840
  And for to haue his fees;

  Somtyme meale and salte,
  Somtyme a bacon flycke,
  That is thre fyngers thycke
  Of larde and of greace,

    I put you out of doute,                                            850
  This can not be brought aboute
  But they theyr tonges fyle,
  And make a plesaunt style
  To Margery and to[1245] Maude,
  Howe they haue no fraude;[1246]
  And somtyme they prouoke

  That they ought by the lawe
  Theyr curates to[1247] content                                       860
  In open tyme and in Lent:[1248]
  God wot, they take great payne
  To flatter and to fayne;
  But[1249] it[1250] is an[1251] olde sayd sawe,
  That nede hath[1252] no lawe.
  Some walke aboute in melottes,[1253]
  In gray russet and heery cotes;
  Some wyl[1254] neyther golde ne grotes;[1255]
  Some plucke a partrych in remotes,
  And by the barres of[1256] her tayle                                 870
  Wyll knowe a rauen from[1257] a rayle,
  A quayle, the raile, and the olde rauen:[1258]
  _Sed libera nos a malo_! _Amen._
  And by _Dudum_, theyr Clementine,[1259]

  And say propreli they ar[1261] _sacerdotes_,
  To shryue, assoyle, and reles[1262]

  But when the freare fell[1264] in the well,
  He coud not syng himselfe therout[1265]                              880
  But by the helpe of Christyan Clout.
  Another Clementyne also,[1266]
  How frere Fabian, with other mo,
  _Exivit de Paradiso_;
  Whan they agayn theder shal come,
  _De hoc petimus consilium_:
  And through all the world they go
  With[1267] _Dirige_ and _Placebo_.
    But nowe my mynd ye vnderstand,
  For they[1268] must take in hande                                    890
  To prech, and to[1269] withstande
  Al maner of abiections;[1270]
  For bysshops haue protections,
  They say, to do corrections,
  But they haue no affections[1271]
  To take the sayd[1272] dyrections;
  In such maner of cases,[1273]
  Men say, they bere no faces
  To occupye suche places,
  To sowe the sede of graces:[1274]                                    900
  Theyr hertes are so faynted,
  And they be so attaynted
  With coueytous and ambycyon,[1275]
  And other superstycyon,
  That they be[1276] deef and dum,
  And play scylens and glum,[1277]
  Can say nothynge but mum.
    They occupye them so
  With syngyng _Placebo_,
  They wyll no farther go:                                             910
  They had leuer to please,
  And take their worldly ease,
  Than to take on hande
  Worsshepfully[1278] to withstande
  Such temporall warre and bate,
  As nowe is made of late
  Agaynst holy Churche[1279] estate,
  Or to maynteyne good[1280] quarelles.
  The lay men call them barrelles
  Full of glotony                                                      920
  And of hypocrysy,
  That counterfaytes[1281] and payntes
  As they were very sayntes:
  In matters that them lyke[1282]
  They shewe them polytyke,
  Pretendyng grauyte
  And sygnyoryte,
  With all solempnyte,
  For theyr indempnyte;
  For they wyll haue no losse[1283]                                    930
  Of a peny nor of a crosse[1284]
  Of theyr predyall landes,
  That cometh to theyr handes,
  And[1285] as farre as they dare set,
  All is fysshe that cometh to net:[1286]
  Buyldyng royally[1287]
  Theyr mancyons curyously,
  With turrettes and with toures,
  With halles and with boures,
  Stretchynge[1288] to the starres,                                    940
  With glasse wyndowes and barres;
  Hangynge aboute[1289] the walles
  Clothes of golde and palles,
  Arras of ryche aray,
  Fresshe[1290] as flours in May;
  Wyth dame Dyana naked;
  Howe lusty Venus quaked,
  And howe[1291] Cupyde shaked
  His darte, and bent his[1292] bowe
  For to shote a crowe                                                 950
  At her tyrly tyrlowe;
  And howe Parys of Troy
  Daunced a lege de moy,[1293]
  Made lusty sporte and ioy
  With dame Helyn the quene;
  With suche storyes bydene
  Their chambres well besene;
  With triumphes of Cesar,
  And of[1294] Pompeyus war,
  Of renowne and of[1295] fame                                         960
  By them to get a name:
  Nowe[1296] all the worlde stares,
  How they ryde in goodly chares,
  Conueyed by olyphantes,
  With lauryat garlantes,[1297]
  And by vnycornes
  With their semely hornes;
  Vpon these beestes rydynge,
  Naked boyes strydynge,
  With wanton wenches winkyng.                                         970
  Nowe truly, to my thynkynge,
  That[1298] is a speculacyon
  And a mete meditacyon
  For prelates of estate,
  Their courage to abate
  From worldly wantonnesse,
  Theyr chambres[1299] thus to dresse
  With suche parfetnesse
  And all suche holynesse;
  How be it they let downe fall                                        980
  Their churches[1300] cathedrall.
    Squyre, knyght, and lorde,
  Thus the Churche[1301] remorde;
  With all temporall people
  They rune agaynst[1302] the steple,
  Thus talkynge and tellyng[1303]
  How some of you are mellyng;
  Yet[1304] softe and fayre for swellyng,
  Beware of a quenes yellyng.[1305]
  It is a besy thyng                                                   990
  For one man[1306] to rule a kyng[1307]
  Alone and[1308] make rekenyng,
  To gouerne ouer all
  And rule a realme royall
  By one mannes verrey[1309] wyt;
  Fortune may chaunce to flyt,
  And whan[1310] he weneth to syt,
  Yet may he mysse the quysshon:
  For I rede a[1311] preposycyon,
  _Cum[1312] regibus amicare,[1313]_                                  1000
  _Et omnibus dominari,_
  _Et supra te pravare_;[1314]
  Wherfore[1315] he hathe good vre
  That can hymselfe assure
  Howe fortune wyll endure.
  Than let reason you supporte,
  For the communalte dothe reporte[1316]
  That[1317] they haue great wonder
  That ye[1318] kepe them so vnder;
  Yet[1319] they meruayle so moche[1320] lesse,                       1010
  For ye play so at the chesse,
  As they suppose and gesse,
  That some of you but late
  Hath played so checkemate
  With lordes of great estate,[1321]
  After suche a rate,
  That they shall mell[1322] nor make,
  Nor vpon them take,[1323]
  For[1324] kynge nor kayser sake,
  But at the playsure of[1325] one                                    1020
  That ruleth the roste[1326] alone.
    Helas,[1327] I say, helas!
  Howe may this come to passe,
  That a man shall here a[1328] masse,
  And not[1329] so hardy on his hede
  To loke on God in forme of brede,
  But that[1330] the parysshe clerke
  There vpon must herke,[1331]
  And graunt hym at[1332] his askyng
  For to se the sacryng?                                              1030
    And[1333] howe may this accorde,
  No man to our souerayne lorde
  So hardy to make sute,
  Nor yet[1334] to execute
  His commaundement,
  Without the assent
  Of our presydent,
  Nor to expresse[1335] to his person,[1336]
  Without your consentatyon[1337]
  Graunt hym his lycence                                              1040
  To preas to his presence,
  Nor to speke to hym[1338] secretly,
  Openly nor[1339] preuyly,
  Without his[1340] presydent be by,
  Or els his substytute
  Whom he wyll depute?
  Neyther erle ne duke[1341]
  Permytted? by[1342] saynt Luke,
  And by swete saynt Marke,
  This is a wonderous warke![1343]                                    1050
  That the people talke this,
  Somewhat there is amysse:
  The deuil cannot stop their mouthes,
  But they wyl talke of such vncouthes,[1344]
  All that euer they ken
  Agaynst all spirituall[1345] men.
    Whether it be wrong or ryght,
  Or els for dyspyght,
  Or howe euer it hap,[1346]
  Theyr tonges thus do[1347] clap,                                    1060
  And through suche detractyon
  They put you to your actyon;
  And[1348] whether they say trewly
  As they may abyde therby,
  Or els that they do lye,
  Ye knowe better then I.
  But nowe _debetis scire_,
  And groundly _audire_,
  In your _convenire_,[1349]
  Of this premenire,                                                  1070
  Or els in the myre
  They saye they wyll you cast;
  Therfore stande sure and fast.[1350]
    Stande sure, and take[1351] good fotyng,
  And let be all your motyng,
  Your gasyng and your totyng,
  And[1352] your parcyall promotyng
  Of those that stande[1353] in your grace;
  But[1354] olde seruauntes ye chase,
  And put them out of theyr place.                                    1080
  Make ye no murmuracyon,
  Though I wryte after[1355] this facion;
  Though I, Colyn Cloute,
  Among the hole route
  Of you that clerkes be,
  Take nowe vpon[1356] me
  Thus[1357] copyously to wryte,
  I do it for[1358] no despyte.
  Wherfore take no dysdayne
  At my style rude[1359] and playne;                                  1090
  For I rebuke no man
  That vertuous[1360] is: why than
  Wreke ye your anger on me?
  For those[1361] that vertuous be
  Haue no cause to say
  That I[1362] speke out of the way.
    Of no good bysshop speke I,
  Nor[1363] good preest I escrye,[1364]
  Good frere, nor good chanon,
  Good nonne, nor good canon,                                         1100
  Good monke, nor good clercke,
  Nor yette[1365] of no good werke:
  But my recountyng is
  Of them that do[1366] amys,
  In speking and rebellyng,[1367]
  In hynderyng and dysauaylyng
  Holy Churche,[1368] our mother,
  One agaynst[1369] another;
  To vse suche despytyng[1370]
  Is all my hole wrytyng;                                             1110
  To hynder no man,
  As nere as I can,
  For no man haue I named:
  Wherfore sholde I be[1371] blamed?
  Ye ought to be ashamed,
  Agaynst[1372] me to be gramed,[1373]
  And can[1374] tell no cause why,
  But that I wryte trewly.
    Then yf any there be
  Of hygh or[1375] lowe degre                                         1120
  Of the spiritualte,
  Or of[1376] the temporalte,
  That dothe thynke or wene
  That[1377] his conscyence be not clene,
  And feleth[1378] hymselfe sycke,
  Or touched on the quycke,
  Suche grace God them sende
  Themselfe to[1379] amende,
  For I wyll not pretende
  Any man to offende.                                                 1130
    Wherfore, as thynketh[1380] me,
  Great ydeottes[1381] they be,
  And lytell grace they haue,
  This treatyse to depraue;
  Nor wyll here no prechyng,
  Nor no vertuous techyng,
  Nor wyll haue no resytyng
  Of any[1382] vertuous wrytyng;
  Wyll knowe none intellygence
  To refourme theyr neglygence,                                       1140
  But lyue styll out of facyon,
  To theyr owne dampnacyon.
  To do shame they haue no shame,
  But they wold[1383] no man shulde them blame:
  They haue an euyl name,
  But[1384] yet they wyll occupy the same.
    With them the worde of God
  Is counted for no rod;[1385]
  They counte it for a raylyng,
  That nothyng is[1386] auaylyng;                                     1150
  The prechers with euyll[1387] hayling:
  Shall they daunt[1388] vs prelates,
  That be theyr[1389] prymates?
  Not so hardy on theyr pates!
  Herke, howe the losell[1390] prates,
  With a wyde wesaunt!
  Auaunt, syr Guy of Gaunt!
  Auaunt, lewde preest, auaunt!
  Auaunt, syr doctour Deuyas![1391]
  Prate of[1392] thy matyns and thy masse,                            1160
  And let our maters[1393] passe:
  Howe darest[1394] thou, daucocke, mell?
  Howe darest thou, losell,[1395]
  Allygate the gospell
  Agaynst vs of the counsell?[1396]
  Auaunt[1397] to the deuyll of hell!
  Take hym, wardeyne[1398] of the Flete,
  Set hym fast by the fete!
  I say, lyeutenaunt of the Toure,
  Make this lurdeyne for to loure;                                    1170
  Lodge hym in Lytell Ease,
  Fede hym with beanes and pease!
  The Kynges Benche or Marshalsy,
  Haue hym[1399] thyder by and by!
  The vyllayne[1400] precheth openly,
  And declareth our vyllany;
  And of our fre[1401] symplenesse
  He sayes that we are[1402] rechelesse,
  And full of wylfulnesse,
  Shameles and mercylesse,[1403]                                      1180
  Incorrigible and insaciate;[1404]
  And after this rate
  Agaynst vs dothe[1405] prate.
    At Poules Crosse or els where,
  Openly at Westmynstere,
  And Saynt Mary[1406] Spyttell,
  They set not by[1407] vs a whystell:[1408]
  At the Austen fryers
  They count vs for[1409] lyers:
  And[1410] at Saynt Thomas of Akers                                  1190
  They carpe vs[1411] lyke crakers,
  Howe we wyll rule[1412] all at wyll
  Without good reason or[1413] skyll;
  And say how that we be
  Full of parcyalyte;[1414]
  And howe at a pronge
  We tourne ryght into[1415] wronge,
  Delay causes so longe
  That ryght no man can fonge;
  They say many matters be[1416] born                                 1200
  By the ryght of[1417] a rambes horne.
  Is not this a shamfull scorne,
  To be[1418] teared thus and torne?
    How may we thys[1419] indure?
  Wherfore we make you sure,
  Ye[1420] prechers shall be yawde;
  And[1421] some shall be sawde,
  As noble[1422] Ezechyas,
  The holy prophet, was;
  And some of you shall dye,                                          1210
  Lyke holy Jeremy;
  Some hanged, some[1423] slayne,
  Some beaten to the brayne;
  And we wyll rule[1424] and rayne,
  And our matters mayntayne
  Who dare say there agayne,
  Or who dare dysdayne
  At our[1425] pleasure and wyll:
  For, be it good or be it yll,
  As it is, it shall be styll,                                        1220
  For all master doctour of Cyuyll,[1426]
  Or of Diuine,[1427] or doctour Dryuyll,
  Let hym cough, rough,[1428] or sneuyll;
  Renne[1429] God, renne deuyll,
  Renne who may renne[1430] best,
  And let take all the rest![1431]
  We[1432] set not a nut shell
  The way to heuen or to[1433] hell.
    Lo, this is the gyse now a dayes!
  It is to drede, men sayes,                                          1230
  Lest they be Saduces,[1434]
  As they be sayd sayne
  Whiche[1435] determyned[1436] playne
  We shulde not ryse agayne
  At dredefull domis day;
  And so it semeth[1437] they play,
  Whiche hate to be corrected
  Whan they be infected,
  Nor wyll[1438] suffre this boke
  By hoke ne[1439] by croke                                           1240
  Prynted for to be,
  For that no man shulde se
  Nor rede in any scrolles[1440]
  Of theyr drunken nolles,
  Nor of theyr noddy polles,
  Nor of theyr sely soules,
  Nor of some wytles pates
  Of dyuers great estates,
  As well[1441] as other men.
    Now to withdrawe my pen,                                          1250
  And now a whyle to rest,
  Me semeth it[1442] for the best.
    The forecastell of my shyp
  Shall glyde, and smothely slyp
  Out of the wawes wod
  Of[1443] the stormy flod;
  Shote anker, and lye at rode,
  And sayle not farre abrode,
  Tyll the cost be clere,
  And[1444] the lode starre appere:                                   1260
  My shyp nowe wyll I stere[1445]
  Towarde the porte salu[1446]
  Of our Sauyour Jesu,
  Suche grace that he vs sende,
  To rectyfye and[1447] amende
  Thynges that are amys,
  Whan that[1448] his pleasure is.

A RYGHT DELECTABLE TRATYSE VPON A GOODLY GARLANDE OR CHAPELET OF
LAURELL,[1458]

BY MAYSTER SKELTON, POETE LAUREAT, STUDYOUSLY DYUYSED AT SHERYFHOTTON
CASTELL, IN THE FORESTE OF GALTRES, WHEREIN AR COMPRYSYDE MANY AND DYUERS
SOLACYONS AND RYGHT PREGNANT ALLECTYUES OF SYNGULAR PLEASURE, AS MORE AT
LARGE IT DOTH APERE IN THE PROCES FOLOWYNGE.

  _Eterno mansura die dum sidera fulgent,_
  _Æquora dumque tument, hæc laurea nostra virebit:_
  _Hinc nostrum celebre et nomen referetur ad astra,_
  _Undique Skeltonis memorabitur alter Adonis._


  Arectyng my syght towarde the zodyake,
    The sygnes xii for to beholde a farre,
  When Mars retrogradant[1459] reuersyd his bak,
    Lorde of the yere in his orbicular,[1460]
    Put vp his sworde, for he cowde make no warre,
  And whan Lucina plenarly[1461] did shyne,
  Scorpione ascendynge degrees twyse nyne;

  In place alone then musynge in my thought
    How all thynge passyth as doth the somer flower,
  On[1462] euery halfe my reasons forthe I sought,                      10
    How oftyn fortune varyeth in an howre,
    Now clere wether, forthwith a stormy showre;
  All thynge compassyd, no perpetuyte,
  But now in welthe, now in aduersyte.

  So depely drownyd I was in this dumpe,
    Encraumpysshed so sore was my conceyte,
  That, me to rest, I lent me to a stumpe
    Of an oke, that somtyme grew full streyghte,
    A myghty tre and of a noble heyght,
  Whose bewte blastyd was with the boystors wynde,                      20
  His leuis loste, the sappe was frome the rynde.

  Thus stode I in the frytthy forest of Galtres,
    Ensowkid with sylt[1463] of the myry mose,
  Where hartis belluyng, embosyd with distres,
    Ran on the raunge so longe, that I suppose
    Few men can tell now[1464] where the hynde calfe gose;
  Faire fall that forster[1465] that so well[1466] can bate his hownde!
  But of my purpose[1467] now torne we to the grownde.

  Whylis I stode musynge in this medytatyon,
    In slumbrynge I fell[1468] and halfe in a slepe;                    30
  And whether it were of ymagynacyon,
    Or of humors superflue, that often wyll crepe
    Into the brayne by drynkyng ouer depe,
  Or it procedyd of fatall persuacyon,
  I can not wele tell[1469] you what was the occasyon;

  But sodeynly at ones, as I me aduysed,[1470]
    As one in a trans or in an extasy,
  I sawe a pauylyon wondersly[1471] disgysede,
    Garnysshed fresshe after my fantasy,
    Enhachyde with perle and stones preciously,                         40
  The grounde engrosyd and bet with bourne golde,
  That passynge goodly it was to beholde:

  Within it,[1472] a prynces excellente of porte;
    But to recounte her ryche abylyment,
  And what estates to her did resorte,
    Therto am I full insuffycyent;
    A goddesse inmortall[1473] she dyd represente;
  As I harde say, dame Pallas was her name;
  To whome supplyed the royall Quene of Fame.[1474]

_The Quene of Fame to Dame Pallas._

  Prynces moost pusant, of hygh preemynence,                            50
    Renownyd[1475] lady aboue the sterry heuyn,
  All other transcendyng, of very congruence
    Madame regent of the scyence[1476] seuyn,
    To whos astate all noblenes most lenen,[1477]
  My supplycacyon to you I arrect,
  Whereof I beseche[1478] you to tender the effecte.

  Not[1479] vnremembered it is vnto your grace,
    How you gaue me a ryall[1480] commaundement
  That in my courte Skelton shulde haue a place,
    Bycause that his tyme he[1481] studyously hath spent                60
    In your seruyce; and, to the accomplysshement
  Of your request, regestred is his name
  With laureate tryumphe in the courte of Fame.

  But, good madame, the accustome and vsage
    Of auncient poetis, ye wote full wele, hath bene
  Them selfe to embesy[1482] with all there holl corage,
    So that there workis myght famously be sene,
    In figure wherof they were the[1483] laurell grene;
  But how it is, Skelton is wonder slake,
  And, as we dare, we fynde in hym grete lake:[1484]                    70

  For, ne were onely he hath your promocyon,
    Out of my bokis full sone I shulde hym rase;
  But sith he hath tastid of the sugred[1485] pocioun
    Of Elyconis[1486] well, refresshid with your grace,
    And wyll not[1487] endeuour hymselfe to purchase
  The fauour of ladys with wordis electe,
  It is sittynge that ye must hym correct.

_Dame Pallas to the Quene of Fame._

  The sum of your purpose, as we ar aduysid,[1488]
    Is that[1489] our seruaunt is sum what to dull;
  Wherin this answere for hym we haue comprisid,                        80
    How ryuers rin not[1490] tyll the spryng be full;
    Better[1491] a dum mouthe than a brainles scull;
  For if he gloryously pullishe[1492] his matter,
  Then men wyll say how he doth but flatter;

  And if so[1493] hym fortune to wryte true and plaine,
    As sumtyme he must vyces remorde,
  Then sum wyll say he hath but lyttill brayne,
    And how his wordes with reason wyll not[1494] accorde;[1495]
    Beware, for wrytyng remayneth of recorde;
  Displease not an hundreth[1496] for one mannes pleasure;              90
  Who wryteth wysely hath a grete treasure.

  Also, to furnisshe better his excuse,
    Ouyde was bannisshed for suche a skyll,
  And many mo whome I cowde enduce;
    Iuuenall was thret parde for to kyll
    For certayne enuectyfys,[1497] yet wrote[1498] he none ill,
  Sauynge he rubbid sum vpon[1499] the gall;
  It was not[1500] for hym to abyde[1501] the tryall.

  In generrall wordes, I say not gretely nay,
    A poete somtyme may for his pleasure taunt,                        100
  Spekyng in parablis,[1502] how the fox, the grey,
    The gander, the gose, and the hudge oliphaunt,
    Went with the pecok ageyne[1503] the fesaunt;
  The lesarde came lepyng, and sayd that he must,
  With helpe of the ram, ley all in the dust.

  Yet dyuerse ther[1504] be, industryous of reason,
    Sum what wolde gadder in there coniecture[1505]
  Of suche an endarkid chapiter sum season;
    How be it, it were harde to construe this lecture;
    Sophisticatid craftely is many a confecture;                       110
  Another manes mynde diffuse is to expounde;
  Yet harde is to make but sum fawt be founde.

_The Quene of Fame to Dame Pallas._

  Madame, with fauour of your benynge sufferaunce,
    Vnto your grace then make I this motyue;
  Whereto made ye me hym to auaunce
    Vnto the rowme of laureat promotyue?
    Or wherto shulde he haue that[1506] prerogatyue,
  But if he had made sum memoryall,
  Wherby he myght haue a name inmortall?[1507]

  To pas the tyme in slowthfull ydelnes,                               120
    Of your royall palace it is not[1508] the gyse,
  But to do sumwhat iche man doth hym dres:
    For how shulde Cato els be callyd wyse,
    But that his bokis, whiche he did deuyse,
  Recorde the same? or why is had in mynde
  Plato, but for that he[1509] left wrytynge behynde,

  For men to loke on? Aristotille also,
    Of phylosophers callid the princypall,
  Olde Diogenes, with other many mo,
    Demostenes,[1510] that oratour royall,                             130
    That gaue[1511] Eschines suche a cordyall,
  That bannisshed was he by[1512] his proposicyoun,
  Ageyne[1513] whome he cowde make no contradiccyoun?

_Dame Pallas to the Quene of Fame._

  Soft, my good syster,[1514] and make there a pawse:[1515]
    And was Eschines rebukid as ye say?
  Remembre you wele, poynt wele that clause;
    Wherfore then rasid ye not[1516] away
    His name? or why is it, I you praye,
  That he to your courte is goyng and commynge,
  Sith he is slaundred[1517] for defaut of konnyng?                    140

_The Quene of Fame to Dame Pallas._

  Madame, your apposelle[1518] is wele inferrid,
    And at your auauntage[1519] quikly it is
  Towchid, and hard for to be debarrid;[1520]
    Yet shall I answere your grace as in this,
    With your reformacion, if I say amis,
  For, but if your bounte did me assure,
  Myne argument els koude not[1521] longe endure.

  As towchyng that Eschines is remembred,
    That he so sholde be, me semith it sittyng,[1522]
  All be it grete parte he hath surrendred                             150
    Of his onour,[1523] whos dissuasyue in wrytyng
    To corage Demostenes was moche excitynge,
  In settyng out fresshely his crafty persuacyon,
  From whiche Eschines had none euacyon.

  The cause why Demostenes so famously is brutid,
    Onely procedid for that he did outray
  Eschines, whiche was not[1524] shamefully confutid
    But of that famous oratour, I say,
    Whiche passid all other; wherfore I may
  Among my recordes suffer hym namyd,                                  160
  For though[1525] he were venquesshid, yet was he not[1526] shamyd:

  As Ierome,[1527] in his preamble _Frater Ambrosius_,
    Frome that I haue sayde in no poynt doth vary,
  Wherein[1528] he reporteth of the coragius
    Wordes that were moch consolatory
    By Eschines rehersed to the grete glory
  Of Demostenes, that was his vtter foo:
  Few shall ye fynde or none that wyll do so.

_Dame Pallas to the Quene of Fame._

  A thanke to haue, ye haue well deseruyd,
    Your mynde that can maynteyne so apparently;                       170
  But a grete parte yet[1529] ye haue reseruyd
    Of that most folow then conseqently,
    Or els ye demeane you inordinatly;
  For if ye laude hym whome honour hath opprest,
  Then he that doth worste is as good as the best.

  But whome that ye fauoure, I se well, hath a name,
    Be he neuer so lytell of substaunce,
  And whome ye loue not[1530] ye wyll[1531] put to shame;
    Ye counterwey not euynly your balaunce;
    As wele foly as wysdome oft ye do[1532] avaunce:                   180
  For[1533] reporte ryseth many deuerse wayes:
  Sume be moche spokyn of for makynge of frays;

  Some haue a name for thefte and brybery;
    Some be called crafty, that can pyke[1534] a purse;
  Some men be made of for their[1535] mokery;
    Some carefull cokwoldes, some haue theyr wyues curs;
    Some famous wetewoldis, and they be moche wurs;
  Some lidderons,[1536] some losels, some noughty packis;
  Some facers, some bracers, some[1537] make great crackis;

  Some dronken dastardis with their dry soules;                        190
    Some sluggyssh slouyns, that slepe day and nyght;
  Ryot and Reuell be in your courte rowlis;
    Maintenaunce and Mischefe, theis be men of myght;
    Extorcyon is counted with you for a knyght;
  Theis people by me haue none assignement,
  Yet they ryde and rinne[1538] from Carlyll to Kente.

  But lytell or nothynge ye shall[1539] here tell
    Of them that haue vertue by reason of cunnyng,
  Whiche souerenly in honoure shulde excell;
    Men of suche maters make but a[1540] mummynge,                     200
    For wysdome and sadnesse be set out[1541] a sunnyng;
  And suche of my seruauntes as I haue promotyd,
  One faute or other in them shalbe notyd:

  Eyther they wyll[1542] say he is to wyse,
    Or elles he can nought bot whan he is at scole;
  Proue his wytt, sayth he, at cardes or dyce,
    And ye shall well fynde[1543] he is a very fole;
    Twyshe,[1544] set hym a chare, or reche hym a stole,[1545]
  To syt hym[1546] vpon, and rede Iacke a thrummis bybille,
  For truly it were pyte that he sat ydle.                             210

_The Quene of Fame to Dame Pallas._

  To make repungnaunce agayne that ye haue sayde,
    Of very dwte it may not[1547] well accorde,
  But your benynge sufferaunce for my discharge I laid,
    For that I wolde not with you fall at discorde;
    But yet I beseche[1548] your grace that good[1549] recorde
  May be brought forth, suche as can be founde,
  With laureat tryumphe why Skelton sholde be crownde;

  For elles it were to great a derogacyon
    Vnto your palas, our noble courte of Fame,
  That any man vnder supportacyon                                      220
    Withoute deseruynge shulde haue the best game:
    If he to the ample encrease of his name
  Can lay any werkis that he hath compylyd,
  I am contente that he be not[1550] exylide

  Frome the laureat senate by force of proscripcyon;
    Or elles, ye know well, I can do no lesse
  But I most bannysshe hym frome my iurydiccyon,[1551]
    As he that aquentyth hym with ydilnes;
    But if that he purpose to make a redresse,
  What he hath done, let it be brought to syght;                       230
  Graunt my petycyon, I aske you but ryght.

_Dame Pallas to the Quene of Fame._

  To your request we be well condiscendid:
    Call forthe, let se where is your clarionar,
  To blowe a blaste with his long breth extendid;
    Eolus, your trumpet, that[1552] knowne is so farre,
    That bararag blowyth in euery mercyall warre,
  Let hym blowe now, that we may take a[1553] vewe
  What poetis we haue at our retenewe;

  To se if Skelton wyll[1554] put hymselfe in prease
    Amonge the thickeste of all the hole rowte;                        240
  Make noyse enoughe, for claterars loue no peas;
    Let se, my syster, now spede you,[1555] go aboute;
    Anone, I sey, this trumpet were founde out,
  And for no man hardely let hym spare
  To blowe bararag[1556] tyll bothe his eyne stare.

_Skelton Poeta._

  Forthwith there rose amonge the thronge
    A wonderfull noyse, and on euery syde
  They presid in faste; some thought they were to longe;
    Sume were to hasty, and wold no man byde;
    Some whispred, some rownyd, some spake, and some cryde,            250
  With heuynge and shouynge, haue in and haue oute;
  Some ranne the nexte way, sume ranne abowte.

  There was suyng to the Quene of Fame;
    He plucked hym backe, and he went afore;
  Nay, holde thy tunge, quod another, let me haue the name;
    Make rowme, sayd another, ye prese all to sore;
    Sume sayd, Holde thy peas, thou getest here no more;
  A thowsande thowsande I sawe on a plumpe:
  With that I harde the noyse of a trumpe,

  That longe tyme blewe a full timorous blaste,                        260
    Lyke to the boryall wyndes whan they blowe,
  That towres and townes and trees downe caste,
    Droue clowdes together lyke dryftis of snowe;
    The dredefull dinne droue all the rowte on a rowe;
  Some tremblid, some girnid, some gaspid, some gasid,
  As people halfe peuysshe, or men that were masyd.

  Anone all was whyste, as it were for the nonys,
    And iche man stode gasyng and staryng vpon other:
  With that there come in wonderly at ones
    A murmur of mynstrels, that suche another                          270
    Had I neuer sene, some softer, some lowder;
  Orpheus, the Traciane, herped meledyously
  Weth Amphion, and other Musis of Archady:

  Whos heuenly armony was so passynge sure,
    So truely proporsionyd, and so well did gree,
  So duly entunyd with euery mesure,
    That in the forest was none so great a tre
    But that he daunced for ioye of that gle;
  The huge myghty okes them selfe dyd auaunce,
  And lepe frome the hylles to lerne for to daunce:                    280

  In so moche the stumpe, whereto I me lente,
    Sterte all at ones an hundrethe[1557] fote backe:
  With that I sprange vp towarde the tent
    Of noble Dame Pallas, wherof I spake;
    Where I sawe come[1558] after, I wote, full lytell lake
  Of a thousande poetes assembled togeder:
  But Phebus was formest of all that cam theder;

  Of laurell leuis a cronell on his hede,
    With heris encrisped[1559] yalowe[1560] as the golde,
  Lamentyng Daphnes, whome with the darte of lede                      290
    Cupyde hath stryken so that she ne wolde
    Concente to Phebus to haue his herte in holde,
  But, for to preserue her maidenhode[1561] clene,
  Transformyd was she into the laurell grene.

  Meddelyd with murnynge[1562] the moost parte of his muse,
    O thoughtfull herte, was euermore his songe!
  Daphnes, my derlynge, why do you me refuse?
    Yet loke on me, that louyd you haue so longe,
    Yet haue compassyon vpon my paynes stronge:
  He sange also how, the tre as he did take                            300
  Betwene his armes, he felt her body quake.

  Then he assurded into this[1563] exclamacyon
    Vnto Diana, the goddes inmortall;[1564]
  O mercyles madame, hard is your constellacyon,
    So close to kepe your cloyster virgynall,
    Enhardid adyment the sement of your wall!
  Alas, what ayle you to be so ouerthwhart,
  To bannysshe pyte out of a maydens harte?

  Why haue the goddes shewyd me this cruelte,
    Sith I contryuyd first princyples medycynable?                     310
  I helpe all other of there infirmite,
    But now to helpe myselfe I am not able;
    That profyteth all other is nothynge profytable
  Vnto me; alas, that herbe nor gresse[1565]
  The feruent axes of loue can not represse!

  O fatall fortune, what haue I offendid?
    Odious disdayne, why raist thou me on this facyon?
  But sith I haue lost now that I entended,
    And may not[1566] atteyne it by no medyacyon,
    Yet, in remembraunce of Daphnes transformacyon,                    320
  All famous poetis ensuynge after me
  Shall were a garlande of the laurell tre.

  This sayd, a great nowmber folowyd by and by
    Of poetis laureat of many dyuerse nacyons;
  Parte of there names I thynke to specefye:
    Fyrste, olde Quintiliane with his Declamacyons;[1567]
    Theocritus with his bucolycall relacyons;
  Esiodus, the iconomicar,[1568]
  And Homerus, the fresshe historiar;

  Prynce of eloquence, Tullius Cicero,                                 330
    With Salusty[1569] ageinst Lucius Catelyne,
  That wrote the history of Iugurta also;
    Ouyde, enshryned with the Musis nyne;
    But blessed Bacchus, the pleasant god of wyne,
  Of closters engrosyd with his ruddy flotis[1570]
  These orators and poetes refresshed there throtis;

  Lucan,[1571] with Stacius in Achilliedos;
    Percius presed forth with problemes diffuse;
  Virgill the Mantuan, with his Eneidos;
    Iuuenall satirray, that men makythe to muse;                       340
    But blessed Bacchus, the pleasant god of wyne,
  Of clusters engrosed with his ruddy flotes
  These orators and poetes refreshed their throtes;

  There Titus Lyuius hymselfe dyd auaunce
    With decadis historious, whiche that he mengith[1572]
  With maters that amount the Romayns in substaunce;
    Enyus, that wrate[1573] of mercyall war at lengthe;
    But blessyd Bachus, potenciall god of strengthe,
  Of clusters engrosid with his ruddy flotis[1574]
  Theis orators and poetis refresshed there throtis;                   350

  Aulus Gelius, that noble historiar;
    Orace also with his new poetry;
  Mayster Terence, the famous comicar,[1575]
    With Plautus, that wrote full[1576] many a comody;
    But blessyd Bachus was in there company,
  Of clusters engrosyd with his ruddy flotis[1577]
  Theis orators and poetis refresshed there throtis;

  Senek full soberly with[1578] his tragediis;
    Boyce, recounfortyd[1579] with his philosophy;
  And Maxymyane, with his madde ditiis,                                360
    How dotynge age wolde iape with yonge foly;
    But blessyd Bachus most reuerent and holy,
  Of clusters engrosid with his ruddy flotis[1580]
  Theis orators and poetis refresshed there throtis;

  There came Johnn Bochas with his volumys grete;
    Quintus Cursius,[1581] full craftely that wrate
  Of Alexander; and Macrobius that did trete
    Of Scipions dreme what was the treu probate;
    But blessyd Bachus that neuer man forgate,
  Of clusters engrosed with his ruddy flotis[1582]                     370
  These orators and poetis refresshid ther throtis;

  Poggeus also, that famous Florentine,
    Mustred ther amonge them with many a mad tale;
  With a frere of Fraunce men call sir Gagwyne,
    That frownyd[1583] on me full angerly and pale;
    But blessyd Bachus, that bote is of all bale,
  Of clusters engrosyd with his ruddy flotis[1584]
  Theis orators and poetis refresshid there throtis;

  Plutarke and Petrarke, two famous clarkis;
    Lucilius and Valerius Maximus by name;                             380
  With Vincencius _in Speculo_, that wrote noble warkis;
    Propercius and Pisandros, poetis of noble fame;
    But blissed Bachus, that mastris oft doth frame,
  Of clusters engrosed with his ruddy flotis[1585]
  Theis notable poetis refresshid there throtis.

  And as I thus sadly amonge them auysid,[1586]
    I saw Gower, that first garnisshed our Englysshe rude,
  And maister Chaucer, that nobly enterprysyd
    How that our Englysshe myght fresshely be ennewed;[1587]
    The monke of Bury then after them ensuyd,                          390
  Dane Johnn Lydgate: theis Englysshe poetis thre,
  As I ymagenyd, repayrid vnto me,

  Togeder in armes, as brethern, enbrasid;
    There apparell farre passynge beyonde that I can tell;
  With diamauntis and rubis there tabers[1588] were trasid,
    None so ryche stones in Turkey to sell;
    Thei wantid nothynge but the laurell;
  And of there bounte they made me godely chere,
  In maner and forme as ye shall after here.

_Mayster Gower to Skelton._

  Brother Skelton, your endeuorment                                    400
    So haue ye done, that meretoryously
  Ye haue deseruyd to haue an enplement
    In our collage aboue the sterry sky,
    Bycause that ye[1589] encrese and amplyfy
  The brutid Britons of Brutus Albion,
  That welny[1590] was loste when that we were gone.

_Poeta Skelton[1591] to Maister Gower._

  Maister Gower, I haue nothyng deserued
    To haue so laudabyle a commendacion:
  To yow thre this honor shalbe reserued,
    Arrectinge vnto your wyse examinacion                              410
    How all that I do is vnder refformation,
  For only the substance of that I entend,
  Is glad to please, and loth to offend.

_Mayster Chaucer to Skelton._[1592]

  Counterwayng your besy delygence
    Of that we beganne in the supplement,
  Enforcid ar we you to recompence,
    Of all our hooll collage by the agreament,
    That we shall brynge you personally present
  Of noble Fame before the Quenes grace,
  In whose court poynted is your place.                                420

_Poeta Skelton answeryth._

  O noble Chaucer, whos pullisshyd eloquence
    Oure Englysshe rude so fresshely hath set out,
  That bounde ar we with all deu reuerence,
    With all our strength that we can brynge about,
    To owe to yow our seruyce, and more if we mowte!
  But what sholde I say? ye wote what I entende,
  Whiche glad am to please, and loth to offende.

_Mayster Lydgate to Skelton._

  So am I preuentid of my brethern tweyne
    In rendrynge to you thankkis meritory,
  That welny[1593] nothynge there doth remayne                         430
    Wherwith to geue you my regraciatory,
    But that I poynt you to be prothonatory[1594]
  Of Fames court, by all our holl assent
  Auaunced by Pallas to laurell preferment.

_Poeta Skelton answeryth._

  So haue ye me far passynge my meretis extollyd,
    Mayster Lidgate, of your accustomable
  Bownte, and so gloryously ye haue enrollyd
    My name, I know well, beyonde that I am able,
    That but if my warkes therto be agreable,
  I am elles rebukyd of that I intende,                                440
  Which glad am to please, and lothe to offende.

  So finally, when they had shewyd there deuyse,
    Vnder the forme as I sayd tofore,[1595]
  I made it straunge, and drew bak ones or twyse,
    And euer they presed on me more and more,
    Tyll at the last they forcyd me so[1596] sore,
  That with them I went where they wolde me brynge,
  Vnto the pauylyon where Pallas was syttyng.

  Dame Pallas commaundid that they shold me conuay
    Into the ryche palace of the Quene of Fame;                        450
  There shal he here what she wyl to hym[1597] say
    When he is callid to answere to his name:
    A cry anone forthwith she made proclame,
  All orators and poetis shulde thider go before,
  With all the prese that there was lesse and more.

  Forthwith, I say, thus wandrynge[1598] in my thought,
    How it was, or elles within what howris,
  I can not[1599] tell you, but that I was brought
    Into a palace with turrettis and towris,
    Engolerid[1600] goodly with hallis and bowris,                     460
  So curiously, so craftely, so connyngly wrowght,
  That all the worlde,[1601] I trowe, and it were sought,

  Suche an other there coude no man fynde;
    Wherof partely I purpose to expounde,
  Whyles it remanyth fresshe in my mynde.
    With turkis and grossolitis enpauyd was the grounde;
    Of birrall enbosid wer the pyllers rownde;
  Of elephantis tethe were the palace gatis,
  Enlosenged with many goodly platis

  Of golde, entachid with many a precyous stone;                       470
    An hundred steppis mountyng to the halle,
  One of iasper, another of whalis bone;
    Of dyamauntis pointed was the rokky[1602] wall;
    The carpettis within and tappettis of pall;
  The chambres hangid with clothes of arace;
  Enuawtyd with rubies the vawte was of this place.

  Thus passid we forth walkynge vnto the pretory
    Where the postis wer enbulyoned with saphiris indy blew,
  Englasid glittering with many a clere story;
    Iacinctis and smaragdis out of the florthe they grew:              480
    Vnto this place all poetis there did sue,
  Wherin was set of Fame the noble Quene,
  All other transcendynge, most rychely besene,

  Vnder a gloryous cloth of astate,
    Fret all with orient perlys of Garnate,
  Encrownyd as empresse of all this worldly[1603] fate,
    So ryally, so rychely, so passyngly ornate,
    It was excedyng byyonde the commowne rate:
  This hous enuyrowne was a myle about;
  If xii were let in, xii hundreth[1604] stode without.                490

  Then to this lady and souerayne of this palace
    Of purseuantis ther presid in with many a[1605] dyuerse tale;
  Some were of Poyle, and sum were of Trace,
    Of Lymerik, of Loreine, of Spayne, of Portyngale,[1606]
    Frome Napuls, from Nauern, and from Rounceuall,
  Some from Flaunders, sum fro the se coste,
  Some from the mayne lande, some fro the Frensche hoste:

  With, How doth the north? what tydyngis in the sowth?
    The west is wyndy, the est is metely wele;
  It is harde to tell of euery mannes mouthe;                          500
    A slipper holde the taile is of an ele,
    And he haltith often that hath a kyby hele;
  Some shewid his salfecundight,[1607] some shewid his charter,[1608]
  Some lokyd full smothely, and had a fals quarter;[1609]

  With, Sir, I pray you, a lytyll tyne stande backe,
    And lette me come in to delyuer my lettre;
  Another tolde how shyppes wente to wrak;
    There were many wordes smaller and gretter,
    With, I as good as thou, Ifayth and no better;
  Some came to tell treuth, some came to lye,                          510
  Some came[1610] to flater, some came to spye:

  There were, I say, of all maner of sortis,
    Of Dertmouth, of Plummouth, of Portismouth also;
  The burgeis and the ballyuis of the v portis,
    With, Now let me come, and now let me go:
    And all tyme wandred I thus to and fro,
  Tyll at the last theis noble poetis thre
  Vnto me sayd, Lo, syr, now ye may se

  Of this high courte the dayly besines;
    From you most we, but not[1611] longe to tary;                     520
  Lo, hither commyth a goodly maystres,
    Occupacyon, Famys regestary,
    Whiche shall be to you a sufferayne accessary,
  With syngular pleasurs to dryue away the tyme,
  And we shall se you ageyne or it be pryme.

  When they were past and wente forth on there way,
    This gentilwoman, that callyd was by name
  Occupacyon, in ryght goodly aray,
    Came towarde me, and smylid halfe in game;
    I sawe hir smyle, and I then[1612] did the same;                   530
  With that on me she kest[1613] her goodly loke;
  Vnder her arme, me thought, she hade a boke.

_Occupacyoun to Skelton._

  Lyke as the larke, vpon the somers day,
    Whan Titan radiant burnisshith his bemis bryght,
  Mountith on hy with her melodious lay,
    Of the soneshyne engladid with the lyght,
    So am I supprysyd with pleasure and delyght
  To se this howre now, that I may say,
  How ye ar welcome to this court of aray.

  Of your aqueintaunce I was in tymes past,                            540
    Of studyous doctryne when at the port salu
  Ye[1614] fyrste aryuyd; whan broken was your mast
    Of worldly trust, then did I you rescu;
    Your storme dryuen shyppe I repared new,
  So well entakeled, what wynde that[1615] euer blowe,
  No stormy tempeste your barge shall ouerthrow.

  Welcome to me as hertely as herte can thynke,
    Welcome to me with all my hole desyre!
  And for my sake spare neyther pen nor ynke;
    Be well assurid I shall aquyte your hyre,                          550
    Your name recountynge beyonde the lande of Tyre,
  From Sydony to the mount Olympyan,
  Frome Babill towre to the hillis Caspian.[1616]

_Skelton Poeta answeryth._

  I thanked her moche of her most noble offer,
    Affyaunsynge her myne hole assuraunce
  For her pleasure to make a large profer,
    Enpryntyng her wordes in my remembraunce,
    To owe her my seruyce with true perseueraunce.
  Come on with me, she sayd, let vs not stonde;[1617]
  And with that worde she toke me by the honde.                        560

  So passyd we forthe into the forsayd place,
    With suche communycacyon as came to our mynde;
  And then she sayd, Whylis we haue tyme and space
    To walke where we lyst, let vs somwhat fynde
    To pas the tyme with, but let vs wast no wynde,
  For ydle iangelers haue but lytill braine;
  Wordes be swordes, and hard to call ageine.

  Into a felde she brought me wyde and large,
    Enwallyd aboute with the stony flint,
  Strongly enbateld, moche costious of charge:                         570
    To walke on this walle she bed I sholde not[1618] stint;
    Go softly, she sayd, the stones be full glint.
  She went before, and bad me take good holde:
  I sawe a thowsande yatis new and olde.

  Then questionyd I her what thos[1619] yatis ment;
    Wherto she answeryd, and breuely me tolde,
  How from the est vnto the occident,
    And from the sowth vnto the north so colde,
    Theis yatis, she sayd, which that ye beholde,
  Be issuis and portis from all maner of nacyons;                      580
  And seryously she shewyd me ther denominacyons.
  They had wrytyng, sum Greke, sum Ebrew,
    Some Romaine letters, as I vnderstode;
  Some were olde wryten, sum were writen new,
    Some carectis of Caldy, sum Frensshe was full good;
    But one gate specyally, where as I stode,
  Had grauin in it of calcydony a capytall A;
  What yate[1620] call ye this? and she sayd, Anglia.[1621]

  The beldynge therof was passynge commendable;
    Wheron stode a lybbard, crownyd with golde and stones,             590
  Terrible of countenaunce and passynge formydable,
    As quikly towchyd as it were flesshe and bones,
    As gastly that glaris, as grimly that gronis,
  As fersly frownynge as he had ben fyghtyng,
  And with his forme foote he shoke forthe this wrytyng:

[Sidenote: Cacosinthicon[1622] ex industria.]

  _Formidanda nimis Jovis ultima fulmina tollis:_
  _Unguibus ire parat loca singula livida curvis_
  _Quam modo per Phœbes nummos raptura Celæno;_
  _Arma, lues, luctus, fel, vis, fraus, barbara tellus;_
  _Mille modis erras odium tibi quærere Martis:_                       600
  _Spreto spineto cedat saliunca roseto._

  Then I me lent, and loked ouer the wall:
    Innumerable people presed to euery gate;
  Shet were the gatis; thei might wel knock and cal,
    And turne home ageyne, for they cam al to late.
    I her demaunded of them and ther astate:
  Forsothe, quod she, theys be haskardis[1623] and rebawdis,
  Dysers, carders, tumblars with gambawdis,

  Furdrers of loue, with baudry aqueinted,
    Brainles blenkardis that blow at the cole,                         610
  Fals forgers of mony, for kownnage[1624] atteintid,
    Pope holy ypocrytis, as they were golde and hole,
    Powle hatchettis, that prate wyll[1625] at euery ale pole,
  Ryot, reueler, railer, brybery, theft,
  With other condycyons that well myght be left:

  Sume fayne themselfe folys, and wolde be callyd wyse,
    Sum medelynge spyes, by craft to grope thy mynde,
  Sum dysdanous dawcokkis that all men dispyse,
    Fals flaterers that fawne thé, and kurris of kynde
    That speke fayre before thé and shrewdly behynde;                  620
  Hither they come crowdyng to get them a name,
  But hailid they be homwarde with sorow and shame.

  With that I herd gunnis russhe out at ones,
    Bowns, bowns, bowns! that all they out cryde;
  It made sum lympe legged and broisid there bones;
    Sum were made peuysshe, porisshly pynk iyde,
    That euer more after by it they were aspyid;
  And one ther was there, I wondred of his hap,
  For a gun stone, I say, had all to-iaggid[1626] his cap,

  Raggid, and daggid, and cunnyngly cut;                               630
    The blaste of the byrnston[1627] blew away his brayne;
  Masid as a marche hare, he ran lyke a scut;
    And, sir, amonge all me thought I saw twaine,
    The one was a tumblar, that afterwarde againe
  Of a dysour, a deuyl way, grew a ientilman,
  Pers Prater, the secund, that[1628] quarillis beganne;

  With a pellit of peuisshenes they had suche a stroke,
    That all the dayes of ther lyfe shall styck by ther rybbis:
  Foo, foisty bawdias! sum smellid of the smoke;
    I saw dyuers that were cariid away thens in cribbis,               640
    Dasyng after dotrellis, lyke drunkardis that dribbis;
  Theis titiuyllis[1629] with taumpinnis wer towchid and tappid;
  Moche mischefe, I hyght you, amonge theem ther happid.

  Sometyme, as it semyth, when the mone light
    By meanys of a grosely endarkyd clowde
  Sodenly is eclipsid in the wynter night,
    In lyke maner of wyse a myst did vs shrowde;
    But wele may ye thynk I was no thyng prowde
  Of that auenturis, whiche made me sore agast.
  In derkenes thus dwelt we, tyll at the last                          650

  The clowdis gan[1630] to clere, the myst was rarifiid:
    In an herber[1631] I saw, brought where I was,
  There birdis on the brere sange on euery syde;
    With alys ensandid about in compas,
    The bankis enturfid with singular solas,
  Enrailid with rosers, and vinis engrapid;
  It was a new comfort of sorowis escapid.

  In the middis a coundight,[1632] that coryously[1633] was cast,
    With pypes of golde engusshing out stremes;
  Of cristall the clerenes theis waters far past,                      660
    Enswymmyng with rochis, barbellis, and bremis,
    Whose skales[1634] ensilured again the son beames
  Englisterd, that ioyous it was to beholde.
  Then furthermore aboute me my syght I reuolde,

  Where I saw growyng a goodly laurell tre,
    Enuerdurid with leuis[1635] contynually grene;
  Aboue in the top a byrde of Araby,
    Men call a phenix; her wynges bytwene
    She bet vp a fyre with the sparkis full kene
  With braunches and bowghis of the swete olyue,                       670

[Sidenote: Oliva speciosa in campis. Nota[1636] excellentiam virtutis in

  Whos flagraunt flower was chefe preseruatyue
  Ageynst all infeccyons with cancour[1637] enflamyd,
    Ageynst all baratows broisiours of olde,
  It passid all bawmys that euer were namyd,
    Or gummis of Saby so derely that be solde:
    There blew in that gardynge a soft piplyng colde
  Enbrethyng of Zepherus with his pleasant wynde;
  All frutis and[1638] flowris grew there in there kynde.

  Dryades there daunsid vpon that goodly soile,
    With[1639] the nyne Muses, Pierides by name;                       680
  Phillis and Testalis,[1640] ther tressis with oyle
    Were newly enbybid; and rownd about the same
    Grene tre of laurell moche solacyous game
  They made, with chapellettes and garlandes grene;
  And formest of all dame Flora, the quene

  Of somer, so formally she fotid the daunce;
    There Cintheus sat twynklyng vpon his harpe stringis;
  And Iopas his instrument did auaunce,
    The poemis and storis auncient inbryngis
    Of Athlas astrology, and many noble thyngis,                       690
  Of wandryng of the mone, the course of the sun,
  Of men and of bestis, and whereof they begone,

  What thynge occasionyd the showris of rayne,
    Of fyre elementar in his supreme spere,
  And of that pole artike whiche doth remayne
    Behynde the taile of Vrsa so clere;
    Of Pliades he prechid with ther drowsy chere,
  Immoysturid with mislyng and ay droppyng dry,
  And where the two Trions[1641] a man shold aspy,

  And of the winter days that hy them so fast,                         700
    And of the wynter nyghtes that tary so longe,
  And of the somer days so longe that doth[1642] last,
    And of their shorte nyghtes; he browght in his songe
    How wronge was no ryght, and ryght was no wronge:
  There was counteryng of carollis in meter and[1643] verse
  So many, that longe it[1644] were to reherse.

_Poeta Skelton answeryth._

  I thanke you, goodly maystres, to me most benynge,
    That of your bounte so well haue me assurid;
  But my request is not[1651] so great a thynge,                       730
    That I ne force what though[1652] it be discurid;
    I am not[1653] woundid but that I may be cured;
  I am not ladyn of liddyrnes with lumpis,
  As dasid doterdis that dreme in their dumpis.

  His name for to know if that ye lyst,
    Enuyous Rancour truely he hight:
  Beware of hym, I warne you; for and[1664] ye wist
    How daungerous it were to stande in his lyght[1665],
    Ye wolde not[1666] dele with hym, thowgh[1667] that ye myght,
  For by his deuellysshe drift and graceles prouision
  An hole reame[1668] he is able to set at deuysion:

  For when he spekyth fayrest, then thynketh he moost yll;
    Full gloryously can he glose, thy mynde for to fele;               760
  He wyll set men a feightynge[1669] and syt[1670] hymselfe styll,
    And smerke, lyke a smythy kur, at[1671] sperkes of steile;
    He[1672] can neuer leue warke whylis it is wele;
  To tell all his towchis it were to grete wonder;
  The deuyll of hell and he be seldome asonder.

  Thus talkyng we went forth[1673] in at a postern gate;
    Turnyng[1674] on the ryght hande, by a[1675] windyng stayre,
  She brought me to[1676] a goodly chaumber of astate,
    Where the noble Cowntes of Surrey in a chayre
    Sat honorably, to whome did repaire                                770
  Of ladys a beue[1677] with all dew reuerence:
  Syt downe, fayre ladys, and do your diligence!

  Come forth, ientylwomen, I pray you, she sayd;
    I haue contryuyd for you a goodly warke,
  And who can worke beste now shall be asayde;
    A cronell of lawrell with verduris light and darke
    I haue deuysyd for Skelton, my clerke;
  For to his seruyce I haue suche regarde,
  That of our bownte we wyll hym rewarde:

  For of all ladyes he hath the library,                               780
    Ther names recountyng in the court of Fame
  Of all gentylwomen he hath the scruteny,[1678]
    In Fames court reportynge the same;
    For yet of women he neuer sayd shame,
  But if they were counterfettes that women them call,
  That list of there lewdnesse with hym for to brall.

  With that the tappettis and carpettis were layd,
    Whereon theis ladys softly myght rest,
  The saumpler to sow on, the lacis to enbraid;
    To weue in the stoule sume were full preste,                       790
    With slaiis, with tauellis, with hedellis well drest;
  The frame was browght forth with his weuyng pin:
  God geue[1679] them good spede there warke[1680] to begin!

  Sume to enbrowder put them in prese,
    Well gydyng ther[1681] glowtonn to kepe streit theyr sylk,

  And, Wynde me that botowme of such an[1683] hew,

    In nedill wark raysyng byrdis in bowris,[1688]
    With vertu enbesid all tymes and howris;
  And truly of theyr bownte thus were they bent
  To worke me this chapelet by goode aduysemente.[1689]

    I me determynyd for to sharpe my pen,
  Deuoutly arrectyng my prayer to Mynerue,
    She to vowchesafe me to informe and ken;
    To Mercury also hertely prayed I then,
  Me to supporte, to helpe, and to assist,
  To gyde and to gouerne my dredfull tremlyng[1694] fist.

  As a mariner that amasid[1695] is in a stormy rage,
    Hardly bestad and[1696] driuen is to hope                          830

    From the anker he kuttyth[1700] the gabyll rope,
  Committyth all to God, and lettyth his shyp ryde;
  So I beseke[1701] Ihesu now to be my gyde.

_To mastres Geretrude Statham._

_To maystres Isabell[1744] Knyght._

  And specyally which glad was to deuyse
  The menes[1748] to fynde
  To please my mynde,
    In helpyng to warke my laurell grene
  With sylke and golde:

  Whiche was extolde

  But, and I had leyser competent,
  I coude shew you[1749] suche a presedent
  In very dede
  Howe ye excede.

_Occupacyon to Skelton._

  Withdrawe your hande, the tyme passis[1750] fast;
    Set on your hede this laurell whiche is wrought;
  Here you[1751] not[1752] Eolus for you blowyth a blaste?
    I dare wele saye that ye and I be sought:
    Make no delay, for now ye must be brought                         1090
  Before my ladys grace, the Quene of Fame,
  Where ye must breuely answere to your name.

_Skelton Poeta._

  Castyng my syght the chambre aboute,
    To se how duly ich thyng in ordre was,
  Towarde the dore,[1753] as we were comyng oute,
    I sawe maister Newton sit with his compas,
    His plummet, his pensell, his spectacles of[1754] glas,
  Dyuysynge in pycture, by his industrious wit,
  Of my laurell the proces euery whitte.

  Forthwith vpon this, as it were in a thought,                       1100
    Gower, Chawcer, Lydgate, theis thre
  Before remembred, me curteisly[1755] brought
    Into that place where as they left me,
    Where all the sayd poetis sat in there degre.
  But when they sawe my lawrell rychely wrought,[1756]
  All other besyde were counterfete[1757] they thought

  In comparyson of that whiche I ware:
    Sume praysed the perle, some the stones bryght;
  Wele was hym that therevpon myght stare;
    Of this warke[1758] they had so great delyght,                    1110
    The silke, the golde, the flowris fresshe to syght,
  They seyd my lawrell was the goodlyest
  That euer they saw, and wrought it was the best.

  In her astate there sat the noble Quene
    Of Fame: perceyuynge how that I was cum,
  She wonderyd me thought[1759] at my laurell grene;
    She loked hawtly, and gaue[1760] on me a glum:
    Thhere was amonge them no worde[1761] then but mum,
  For eche man herkynde what she wolde to me[1762] say;
  Wherof in substaunce I brought this away.                           1120

_The Quene of Fame to Skelton._

  My frende, sith ye ar before vs[1763] here present
    To answere vnto this noble audyence,
  Of that shalbe resonde you[1764] ye must be content;
    And for as moche as, by the hy[1765] pretence
    That ye haue now thorow[1766] preemynence
  Of laureat triumphe,[1767] your place is here reseruyd,
  We wyll vnderstande how ye haue it deseruyd.

_Skelton Poeta to the Quene of Fame._

  Ryght high[1768] and myghty princes of astate,
    In famous glory all other transcendyng,
  Of your bounte the accustomable[1769] rate                          1130
    Hath bene full often and yet is entendyng[1770]
    To all that to[1771] reason is condiscendyng,
  But if hastyue[1772] credence by mayntenance of myght
  Fortune to stande betwene you and the lyght:

  But suche euydence I thynke for to[1773] enduce,
    And so largely to lay for myne indempnite,
  That I trust[1774] to make myne excuse
    Of what charge soeuer ye lay ageinst[1775] me;
    For of my bokis parte ye shall se,
  Whiche in your recordes, I knowe well, be enrolde,                  1140
  And so Occupacyon, your regester, me tolde.

  Forthwith she commaundid I shulde take my place;
    Caliope poynted me where I shulde sit:
  With that, Occupacioun presid in a pace;
    Be mirry, she sayd, be not[1776] aferde a whit,
    Your discharge here vnder myne arme is it.
  So then commaundid she was vpon this
  To shew her boke; and she sayd, Here it is.

_The Quene of Fame to Occupacioun._

  Yowre boke[1777] of remembrauns we will now that ye rede;
    If ony[1778] recordis in noumbyr can be founde,                   1150
  What Skelton hath compilid and wryton in dede
    Rehersyng by ordre, and what is the grownde,
    Let se now for hym how ye can expounde;
  For in owr courte, ye wote wele, his name can not[1779] ryse
  But if he wryte oftenner than ones or twyse.

_Skelton Poeta._

  With that of the boke losende were the claspis:
    The margent was illumynid all with golden railles
  And byse, enpicturid with gressoppes and waspis,
    With butterfllyis and fresshe pecoke taylis,
    Enflorid with flowris and slymy snaylis;                          1160
  Enuyuid picturis well towchid and quikly;
  It wolde haue made a man hole that had be ryght sekely,

  To beholde how it was garnysshyd and bounde,
    Encouerde ouer with golde of tissew fyne;
  The claspis and bullyons were worth a thousande pounde;
    With balassis and charbuncles the borders did shyne;
    With _aurum musicum_ euery other lyne
  Was wrytin: and so she did her spede,
  Occupacyoun, inmediatly[1780] to rede.

_Occupacyoun redith and expoundyth sum parte of Skeltons bokes and

the copy of French verses which follow them and the translations of it
into Latin and English, are from Faukes’s ed.—where, though they have
really no connexion with _The Garlande of Laurell_, they are considered
as a portion of that poem, see the colophon, p. 427; collated with
Marshe’s ed. of Skelton’s _Workes_, 1568,—where they occur towards the
end of the vol., the three last placed together, and the first a few
pages after.—Marshe’s ed. “Admonitio _Skeltonis_ ut _omnes Arbores viridi

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.


START: FULL LICENSE

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
