    For her who dared to take the girl
      Half-formed and careless to her heart,
    I write these simple childish rhymes,
      That she may have that early part,
    The baby that she might not see,
    The childhood fancies missed in me.

[Illustration: ON THE SHINING WAY.]


    All through the happy Childhood land
      They travel the Shining Way,
    The children fresh from the dawn of life,
      With never a thought but play.

    There’s never a care ’neath the shining hair
      Where the sunrise stores its beams;
    The wind that blows is the wind of morn
      From the shore of the Sea of Dreams.

    There’s no other way so glad and sweet,
      And no other sky so blue,
    And the joy of the road to the children is
      That nothing but dreams come true.

    There are great dream meadows and purple hills
      That only the children know;
    They can tell where the tall dream cities rise,
      And the sweet dream flowers grow.

    So on they pass by the milestone years,
      To the land where the grown folks stay,
    And only once is the journey made
      On the wonderful Shining Way.

[Illustration]




[Illustration: THE BEGINNING.]


    Here is the beginning of the road;
      And it’s morning on the hill-top in the sky;
    And there’s mist across the valley to hide the Shining Way,
    That’s full of other children and happy hours of play,
      Where Dorothy will travel by and by.

            The air is full of voices strange and sweet,
            That crowd around her cradle as it swings.
    She thinks they’re made of something white that shimmers on the grass,
    For she doesn’t know a dew-drop from the bobolinks that pass,
            And she doesn’t know a host of other things.




[Illustration: FIRST STAGE OF THE JOURNEY.]


    Sing ho! for the road that opens down
    Out of the sleepy old Baby Town.
    Sing ho! for the joy of the Shining Way,
    For Dorothy took her first steps to-day.

    Mother has helped her alone to stand,
    And now she is holding her dimpled hand,
    And now there’s a start and a tipsy run,
    And life on the road is well begun.

    There’s a tear in the midst of Mother’s smiles,
    But Mother will lead her the first few miles.
    So let her start on her journey gay.
    Sing ho! for the joy of the Shining Way.




[Illustration: AN EARLY START.]


    The dark had not unwrapped the skies
    When I awoke, and rubbed my eyes.
    The world was full of chirping birds,
    I heard their soft, half-sleepy words.
    I tiptoed softly on the floor,
    I slipped the bolt, stole thro’ the door,
    And lo! a wondrous world of gray
    And silver mist before me lay.

    The white dews wet my small bare feet,
    As I ran thro’ the meadows, sweet
    With clover nodding all about,
    And sleepy hum-bees creeping out.

    And then a strange thing came to pass;
    The Sun was sleeping in the grass;
    He must have wakened when I came,
    For all at once a rosy flame
    Peeped at me o’er a little mound,
    And soon the bright Sun, warm and round
    Was looking at me, smiling down
    To see my little slumber-gown.

    O fair the meadow was to see!
    The blossoms laughed and spoke to me.
    And drops like pearls in every place
    Were hanging on the spider’s lace;
    And little rainbows everywhere
    Were dancing in the golden air;
    And bees, and yellow butterflies,
    And beetles, brown and big and wise,
    Went buzzing, flying all about,
    And busy ants ran in and out,
    And songs were in the deep-blue sky,
    —I could not see, they flew so high.

    But all about these things I know,
    Because the daisies whispered low,
    And told me all they knew—much more
    Than I had ever dreamed before.

    And broad and white across the day
    Before me ran the Shining Way.

[Illustration]




[Illustration: THE BUTTERFLY.]


    Butterfly, say, is it true,
      All that the daisies have told?
    Are those bright spots on your wings
      Made out of rainbows and gold?
    Did you come down on a beam
      Of light that shot thro’ the blue?
    Are you a piece of the sun?
      Butterfly, say, is it true?




[Illustration: THE MOON.]


    Swim, white Moon, in the dusky blue,
      Swim in the still dark sky.
    Soft are the clouds that cover you;
      And Jimmy and Alice and I
    Some time, perhaps, a journey will make
    Across the sea on your silver wake.

    Swing, white Moon, to the breeze that blows
      From the Milky Way so bright.
    Alice told me (and Alice knows),
      That I may climb up some night,
    And swing in the cradle you make for me,
    Higher than even the highest tree.

[Illustration]




[Illustration: THE MERCHANT SHIP.]


    Down by the side of the Shining Way
        There’s a ship on the raging sea;
    And she’s bearing a rich and royal load
        Over the waves to me.

    (There are cherries juicy and red and sweet,)
        And when she has reached this side
    The cargo’s mine, and the ship returns
        To Jimmy across the tide.

    If I blow right hard from my side of the sea
        She steadily keeps her track;
    And when she has travelled too far for me,
    Jimmy will blow her back.




[Illustration: BARN-DOOR INN.]


    We were tired of travel one afternoon,
      And stopped at the sign of “The Great Barn-Door,”
    And Jimmy and Alice took rooms in the loft,
      While I had mine on the second floor.

    Jimmy and Alice went climbing high
      Over the rafters above my head,
    And peeped thro’ the swallow-holes out at the sky.
      —If Mother had seen them, what would she have said?

    But I stayed down in the soft new hay,
      And the sun crept in thro’ a yellow chink,
    And a long beam found me out where I lay,
      And tickled my eyes till it made them blink.

    The dust-motes circled and whirled and danced,
      And my pillow was soft and warm and deep,
    And the hay smelled sweet, and it somehow chanced
      That there in the mow I fell asleep.

    And I dreamed a dream full of swallows’ wings,
      And elfish motes in the dusty air,
    And thousands of other wonderful things;
      Till Jimmy and Alice found me there.

[Illustration]




[Illustration: BY COACH.]


    We’re traveling hard and fast to-day,—
      Jimmy and Alice and me—
    Bowling along on the Shining Way,
      With a royal coach and three.

    We laugh at the folk who are passing by,
      Dragging their weary feet
    Deep in the dust that our whizzing wheels
      Have raised in the flying street.

    Fields and forests flit out of sight;
      And if all goes just as we planned
    We’ll travel on till we reach the bars
      At the entrance to Fairy Land.

    And what is the coach on our lordly quest?
      And where are the foaming three?
    Why, the coach is the dump-cart, and the rest—
      Just Jimmy and Alice and me.

[Illustration]




[Illustration: THRO’ FAIRYLAND.]


    It was dark when we stopped at the Fairy-Land bars,
    And over our heads there were millions of stars;
    And I was quite frightened, but Jimmy looked bold,
    And Alice just shivered—she said it was cold.

    We timidly knocked, and then, just as I feared
    They would not let us in, lo! the bars disappeared,
    And the stars dropped right down from the sky, and behold!
    Each one was a lamp for a fairy to hold.

    And the fairies went dancing like leaves in the wind,
    And beckoned to us as we crept on behind;
    And queer little faces, brimful of surprise,
    Looked out of the darkness with queer little eyes.

    But O the sweet fairies! I never could tell
    Of the rose-hues we saw in that wonderful dell—
    The daffodil-yellow, the purple and green,
    But the sweetest of all was the lily-white Queen.

    They sang of the land of the Sugary Dews,
    Where children may eat a whole pie, if they choose;
    A wonderful land, which some day we shall see,
    If the Shining Way leads us—Jim, Alice and me.

    O we shouted with glee! and then to our surprise
    The stars drifted back again into the skies,
    The fairies all vanished, I covered my head,—
    And when I looked up, we were all three in bed.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: BIRD’S-NEST HOLLOW.]


      There is something puzzles me.—
      In the hollow apple-tree,
    Where the Shining Way is broadest, there’s a nest;
      Two fat Robins live in it,
      In and out I see them flit,
    And the biggest wears a gorgeous crimson vest.

      We are friends, and so when I
      Come to look, they do not fly,
    But they chatter from the branches of the tree;
      And I run down there to play,
      When the sun shines, every day,
    And next year they say they’ll build a nest for me.

      I peeped in one day, and found
      Five small eggs, all blue and round,
    And the Robins made me promise not to tell.
      For (they said that this was so)
      Jim and Alice must not know.
    So I promised, and I’ve kept the secret well.

      When to-day I climbed the tree,
      Those two birds had company;
    There were five small squirming children in the nest;
      And the Robins whispered me,
      ’Twas a case of charity,
    For the poor wee birdies were not even dressed.

      And those little wriggling things
      Had big mouths, but wore no wings,
    And the Robins served refreshments down the row.
      But the eggs are gone, you see;
      That’s the thing that puzzles me.
    Did those small birds eat them up, I’d like to know?

[Illustration]




[Illustration: A SORROW.]


    The White Rat died last night.
      We found him cold and stiff;
    We wrapped him warm and tight.
      In my best handkerchief.

    Jimmy marched on before,
      Bearing the poor dead Rat;
    Alice deep mourning wore,
      I had papa’s silk hat.

    Jimmy the sermon preached,
      Alice and I just cried.
    That was a noble speech,
      Worthy the Rat that died.

    We made him a tiny grave.
      Down in the shadow dim
    Where the willow hedge-rows wave
      We solemnly buried him.

    Jimmy and Alice and I
      Went sadly back to our play.
    But there’s a cloud in the sky,
      And a shade on the Shining Way.

[Illustration]




[Illustration: THE RAINBOW.]


    Storm-clouds and thunder and dark rainy weather,
      Wet streams are flowing all down the Shining Way;
    Jimmy and Alice and I are here together,
      Cooped in the nursery and longing for a play.

    Look! there’s a sunbeam, through a sky-crack poking;
      Quick! get your shoes off, as still as still can be;
    Slip out the back door, Mother isn’t looking,
      Steal down the wood-road, before she turns to see.

    Great jolly puddles, round and wet and gleaming—
      Here’s a still clear one, grassy, cool and sweet;
    But we love the brown ones, and in we paddle, screaming,
      Laughing, while the soft mud oozes ’round our feet.

    Trees shake their wet cloaks, and on us falls a shower;
      We laugh the louder, as down the road we run.
    See! there’s a cowslip, and here’s a fairies’ bower,
      All made of violets, nodding to the sun.

    Down in the East, where we still can hear the thunder,
      Over the cloud bends a misty, shining Bow.
    Right at the foot of it are hidden many wonders,
      If we can get there before the colors go.

    Run, hand in hand, then, hair all a-dripping,
      Bare feet splashing thro’ the puddles as we fly.
    Soft shines the Rainbow, as toward it we are tripping;
      The green earth is waving and smiling to the sky.

[Illustration]




[Illustration: HORSE-BACK.]


    Jimmy and Alice and I one day,
      Were filled with a sudden pride;
    No more would we walk on the Shining Way,
      ’Twas pleasanter, far, to ride.

    For Billy, the old white horse, was there,
      He could easily carry three,
    And on his back we would gaily fare
      To the shores of the Sunset Sea.

    So up to the orchard fence we tripped,
      And Billy looked kind and mild,
    And on to his back we softly slipped,
      And Billy, he sort of smiled.

    I sat in the middle and clung to Jim,
      And Alice was out by the tail;
    And “Get up, Billy!” we said to him,
      And away we went in a gale.

    But we never got to the Sunset Sea,
      With its fiery waves aglow,
    For we didn’t count on the old plum-tree,
      And Billy, he did, you know.

    Oh, Billy looked kind and mild enough,
      But a plot in his heart did hide;
    He knew that the plum-tree bark was rough,
      And the branches were low and wide.

    So straight for the tree old Billy steered,
      And vainly we shouted “Whoa!”
    His mind was fixed, and he never veered
      From the path where he meant to go.

    Under the tree he firmly trod,
      (’Twas just high enough for him,)
    And we went tumbling on the sod.
      Scraped off by a scraggly limb.

    No more we rode on the Shining Way;
      We were bruised, and our thoughts were sad;
    While Billy winked, as he looked our way;
      And his wink was knowing and bad.

[Illustration]




[Illustration: AN OCEAN VOYAGE.]


    There’s an ocean wide we must cross to-day,
    For it stretches across the Shining Way.
    A board will make us a famous boat;
    Hurrah! for the high seas. We’re afloat!

    Alice will pilot across the waves,
    Jimmy and I are the galley-slaves;
    We bend to the broomstick instead of the oar,
    And Alice steers for the further shore.

    Carefully on our course we keep
    Over the trackless and rolling deep.
    Under our vessel slowly swim
    Minnows, tadpoles and monsters grim.
    (Fishes we know, but have never seen,)
    And a bull-frog croaks from the rushes green.

    The journey near to an end has grown,
    When Alice’s rudder strikes a stone.
    A lurch—a scramble—a sudden scream,
    And over we go in the wet, wet stream.

    Alice is dripping, and so am I;
    Water has got into Jimmy’s eye;
    But land is reached—we are safe, though cold.
    And we wonder if Mother may chance to scold?

[Illustration]




[Illustration: THE DRAGON-FLY.]


    Where the Shining Way leads on,
    Thro’ the garden, o’er the lawn,
    Past the road and down the hill,
    There’s a place so strange and still,
    Nothing like the world we see
    Every morning, you and me.
    There we found a little pond
    Edged with rushes, and beyond
    Grow the marshes, green and high.
    Wild rice climbing to the sky,
    Fragrant flag and iris beds
    Fringed with purple arrow-heads.

    Little moving waves of air
    Quiver o’er the grasses fair;
    On the shining water blue
    Broad round leaves are shining too;
    Lilies, dreaming in the sun—
    From the bank I peeped in one,
    And the petals, wide apart,
    Showed a sun within its heart.
    And the rushes tall and free,
    Like a forest seemed to me,
    With the rice-trees waving ’round.
    But the silence! Not a sound!
    Very still the lilies lay
    In the golden summer day.

    Sudden, from the wide blue sky,
    Whirred a monster Dragon-Fly.
    Proudly, all alone he came,
    Armor polished to a flame
    On his body, and his wings,
    Gauzy, wondrous, shining things,
    Seemed to catch the water’s blue,
    And the yellow sunbeams, too.
    He’s a hermit, and the spot
    We had found, it seems, was not
    All our own, for here he lives
    On the sweet the iris gives,
    And each day he sallies forth,
    East and west and south and north,
    Tilting like a tourney knight,
    Putting all his foes to flight.

    Never dares a grasshopper
    Or a cricket there to stir,
    While the water-bugs at play,
    When they see him, scud away.
    And his duty is to keep
    Sentry, while the lilies sleep.
    So that every harmful thing,
    Bats that bite, and gnats that sting,
    Crawling worm and robber bee
    From his shining lance must flee.

[Illustration]




[Illustration: A HALT FOR PROVENDER.]


    We made our little garden-plots before the spring was passed,
    And Jimmy, he raised radishes, because they grow so fast;
    And Alice planted flower-seeds, to beautify the ground,
    But I chose cabbages—they grow so grand and great and round.

    And Jimmy’s garden flourished—he had a splendid crop,
    All round and red below the ground, and broad and green on top.
    One day he pulled and ate them all—with salt they’re very good—
    Then Jimmy gave up gardening—but that is understood.

    And Alice’s sweet peas and things were beautifully fair,
    But Tim, the gardener, smiled one day, to see them growing there,
    But what he said was, “Faix, Miss Alice, thim was rare foine sades,
    But ye’ve murthered ivery blissed wan, an’ only lift the wades.”

    Well, cabbage-raising does not pay, my garden is a fright.
    There came a Morning-Glory Vine, and like a thief last night
    He stole along my pretty rows, and this is what he’s done:
    He’s twined around my cabbage plants, and pulled them every one,
    And hung them with their roots to dry, like clothes upon a line—
    Just spoiled my little garden-plot—that wicked ’Glory Vine.

    And that is why we do not care for gardening to-day;
    The crops are very poor this year, and kites are better play.

[Illustration]




[Illustration: THRO’ THE CORNFIELD.]


    There’s a forest thro’ which we went to-day,
      Waving and green and high,
    With feathery tassels tall and gay
      Nodding against the sky;
    The place of all others for fairy tales,
      And plays of the years gone by.

    And this is the game we children played—
      I was an Ogre grim,
    Alice the Princess that fell asleep
      Down in the forest dim,
    And the Prince who wakened her with a kiss
      When he found her—that was Jim.

    The Prince came riding so proud and bold
      On a prancing corn-stalk steed,
    And many a blade was thrust at him,
      But little did Jimmy heed;
    And long vines plucked him to hold him back
      From doing that daring deed.

    The Ogre leaped from its hiding-place,
      With a menace fierce and grim,
    And a big green pumpkin kept the door,
      And scowled and leered at him;
    But he bravely charged and routed his foes
      With his trusty “Cherry-Limb.”

    The corn-blades dropped on their bended joints,
      But vainly for mercy pled,
    The pumpkin yielded, the Ogre turned
      With a horrible shriek and fled,
    The Princess was duly kissed, and so
      Sweet Alice and Jim were wed.

[Illustration]




[Illustration: THE HALO.]


    There’s a picture of an angel, hanging on our study wall,
    A lovely angel with white wings, and very grand and tall;
    Around about her head there is a shining golden ring,
    And I asked Jimmy why she wore that funny yellow thing;
    And Jimmy laughed and said to me; “Why, silly, don’t you know?
    That’s nothing but a saint-hole; all angels have them so.
    The Shining Way runs through it, straight to her heavenly home,
    And when she’s tired of the earth, she calls to God to come;
    He reaches down and pulls her through, before you can count seven,
    And you can’t see her any more, because she is in Heaven.”

    I don’t quite understand it, the thought is very new;
    But if I had a saint-hole, I’d go to Heaven too.

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
