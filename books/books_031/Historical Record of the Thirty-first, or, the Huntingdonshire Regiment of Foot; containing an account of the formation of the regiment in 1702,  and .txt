PREFACE.


The character and credit of the British Army must chiefly depend
upon the zeal and ardour by which all who enter into its service
are animated, and consequently it is of the highest importance that
any measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation, by which
alone great and gallant actions are achieved, should be adopted.

Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment of this desirable
object than a full display of the noble deeds with which the
Military History of our country abounds. To hold forth these bright
examples to the imitation of the youthful soldier, and thus to
incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those who have
preceded him in their honorable career, are among the motives that
have given rise to the present publication.

The operations of the British Troops are, indeed, announced in the
“London Gazette,” from whence they are transferred into the public
prints: the achievements of our armies are thus made known at the
time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute of praise and
admiration to which they are entitled. On extraordinary occasions,
the Houses of Parliament have been in the habit of conferring on
the Commanders, and the Officers and Troops acting under their
orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks for their skill
and bravery; and these testimonials, confirmed by the high honour
of their Sovereign’s approbation, constitute the reward which the
soldier most highly prizes.

It has not, however, until late years, been the practice (which
appears to have long prevailed in some of the Continental armies)
for British Regiments to keep regular records of their services
and achievements. Hence some difficulty has been experienced in
obtaining, particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.

This defect will now be remedied, in consequence of His Majesty
having been pleased to command that every Regiment shall, in
future, keep a full and ample record of its services at home and
abroad.

From the materials thus collected, the country will henceforth
derive information as to the difficulties and privations which
chequer the career of those who embrace the military profession. In
Great Britain, where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns, of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce,
and where these pursuits have, for so long a period, been
undisturbed by the _presence of war_, which few other countries
have escaped, comparatively little is known of the vicissitudes of
active service and of the casualties of climate, to which, even
during peace, the British Troops are exposed in every part of the
globe, with little or no interval of repose.

In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which the country
derives from the industry and the enterprise of the agriculturist
and the trader, its happy inhabitants may be supposed not often to
reflect on the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,--on
their sufferings,--and on the sacrifice of valuable life, by which
so many national benefits are obtained and preserved.

The conduct of the British Troops, their valour, and endurance,
have shone conspicuously under great and trying difficulties; and
their character has been established in Continental warfare by the
irresistible spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the gallantry and
steadiness with which they have maintained their advantages against
superior numbers.

In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders, ample
justice has generally been done to the gallant exertions of the
Corps employed; but the details of their services and of acts of
individual bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.

These Records are now preparing for publication, under His
Majesty’s special authority, by Mr. RICHARD CANNON, Principal Clerk
of the Adjutant-General’s Office; and while the perusal of them
cannot fail to be useful and interesting to military men of every
rank, it is considered that they will also afford entertainment and
information to the general reader, particularly to those who may
have served in the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.

There exists in the breasts of most of those who have served, or
are serving, in the Army, an _Esprit de Corps_--an attachment
to everything belonging to their Regiment; to such persons a
narrative of the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of the great, the
valiant, the loyal, have always been of paramount interest with
a brave and civilized people. Great Britain has produced a race
of heroes who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood “firm
as the rocks of their native shore:” and when half the world has
been arrayed against them, they have fought the battles of their
Country with unshaken fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,--victories so complete and surprising, gained
by our countrymen, our brothers, our fellow-citizens in arms,--a
record which revives the memory of the brave, and brings their
gallant deeds before us,--will certainly prove acceptable to the
public.

Biographical Memoirs of the Colonels and other distinguished
Officers will be introduced in the Records of their respective
Regiments, and the Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying the value
and importance of its services, will be faithfully set forth.

As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record of each Regiment
will be printed in a distinct number, so that when the whole shall
be completed, the Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.




INTRODUCTION

TO

THE INFANTRY.


The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been celebrated for
innate courage and unshaken firmness, and the national superiority
of the British troops over those of other countries has been
evinced in the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery, that no doubts can
be raised upon the facts which are recorded. It must therefore be
admitted, that the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
INTREPIDITY. This quality was evinced by the inhabitants of England
when their country was invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army,
on which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into the sea to
attack the Roman soldiers as they descended from their ships; and,
although their discipline and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing intimidated
the flower of the Roman troops, including Cæsar’s favourite tenth
legion. Their arms consisted of spears, short swords, and other
weapons of rude construction. They had chariots, to the axles of
which were fastened sharp pieces of iron resembling scythe-blades,
and infantry in long chariots resembling waggons, who alighted
and fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit or retreat,
sprang into the chariot and drove off with the speed of cavalry.
These inventions were, however, unavailing against Cæsar’s
legions: in the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and British courage, being
thus regulated, was exerted to the greatest advantage; a full
development of the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.

The military force of the Anglo-Saxons consisted principally of
infantry: Thanes, and other men of property, however, fought on
horseback. The infantry were of two classes, heavy and light. The
former carried large shields armed with spikes, long broad swords
and spears; and the latter were armed with swords or spears only.
They had also men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.

The feudal troops established by William the Conqueror consisted
(as already stated in the Introduction to the Cavalry) almost
entirely of horse; but when the warlike barons and knights, with
their trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although these were of inferior
degree, they proved stout-hearted Britons of stanch fidelity. When
stipendiary troops were employed, infantry always constituted a
considerable portion of the military force; and this _arme_ has
since acquired, in every quarter of the globe, a celebrity never
exceeded by the armies of any nation at any period.

The weapons carried by the infantry, during the several reigns
succeeding the Conquest, were bows and arrows, half-pikes, lances,
halberds, various kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of time the practice
became general for military men to be so completely cased in steel,
that it was almost impossible to slay them.

The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the destructive
purposes of war, in the early part of the fourteenth
century, produced a change in the arms and equipment of the
infantry-soldier. Bows and arrows gave place to various kinds of
fire-arms, but British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and, owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect bore of
the fire-arms when first introduced, a body of men, well trained
in the use of the bow from their youth, was considered a valuable
acquisition to every army, even as late as the sixteenth century.

During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth each company
of infantry usually consisted of men armed five different ways; in
every hundred men forty were “_men-at-arms_,” and sixty “_shot_;”
the “men-at-arms” were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe men, and
thirty pikemen; and the “shot” were twenty archers, twenty
musketeers, and twenty harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides
his principal weapon, a sword and dagger.

Companies of infantry varied at this period in numbers from 150
to 300 men; each company had a colour or ensign, and the mode of
formation recommended by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was:--the colour in the centre of the company
guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen in equal proportions, on
each flank of the halberdiers: half the musketeers on each flank
of the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were much lighter than the
muskets then in use) in equal proportions on each flank of the
company for skirmishing.[1] It was customary to unite a number
of companies into one body, called a REGIMENT, which frequently
amounted to three thousand men: but each company continued to carry
a colour. Numerous improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found impossible to
make armour proof against the muskets then in use (which carried
a very heavy ball) without its being too weighty for the soldier,
armour was gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse, and the infantry
were reduced to two classes, viz.: _musketeers_, armed with
matchlock muskets, swords, and daggers; and _pikemen_, armed with
pikes from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.

In the early part of the seventeenth century Gustavus Adolphus,
King of Sweden, reduced the strength of regiments to 1000 men. He
caused the gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in flasks,
or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing a charge, to be
made up into cartridges, and carried in pouches; and he formed
each regiment into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming four regiments
into a brigade; and the number of colours was afterwards reduced to
three in each regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that his
infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated Polish horsemen
and Austrian cuirassiers; and his armies became the admiration of
other nations. His mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great was the prejudice
in favour of ancient customs, that all his improvements were not
adopted until near a century afterwards.

In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service, styled
the Admiral’s regiment. In 1678 each company of 100 men usually
consisted of 30 pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with light
firelocks. In this year the King added a company of men armed with
hand grenades to each of the old British regiments, which was
designated the “grenadier company.” Daggers were so contrived as to
fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets, similar to those
at present in use, were adopted about twenty years afterwards.

An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by order of King James
II., to guard the artillery, and was designated the Royal Fusiliers
(now 7th Foot). This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.

King William III. incorporated the Admiral’s regiment in the second
Foot Guards, and raised two Marine regiments for sea-service.
During the war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14 pikemen and 46
musketeers; the captains carried pikes; lieutenants, partisans;
ensigns, half-pikes; and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in
1697 the Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again formed on
the breaking out of the war in 1702.[2]

During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were laid aside, and every
infantry soldier was armed with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the
grenadiers ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside their third colour:
the corps of Royal Artillery was first added to the Army in this
reign.

About the year 1745, the men of the battalion companies of infantry
ceased to carry swords; during the reign of George II. light
companies were added to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers should lay aside
their swords, as that weapon had never been used during the Seven
Years’ War. Since that period the arms of the infantry soldier have
been limited to the musket and bayonet.

The arms and equipment of the British Troops have seldom differed
materially, since the Conquest, from those of other European
states; and in some respects the arming has, at certain periods,
been allowed to be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage, the bravery and
superiority of the British infantry have been evinced on very many
and most trying occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.

Great Britain has produced a race of lion-like champions who have
dared to confront a host of foes, and have proved themselves
valiant with any arms. At _Crecy_, King Edward III., at the head
of about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August, 1346, Philip
King of France, whose army is said to have amounted to 100,000
men; here British valour encountered veterans of renown:--the
King of Bohemia, the King of Majorca, and many princes and nobles
were slain, and the French army was routed and cut to pieces. Ten
years afterwards, Edward Prince of Wales, who was designated the
Black Prince, defeated, at _Poictiers_, with 14,000 men, a French
army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry, and took John I., King of
France, and his son Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October,
1415, King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000 men, although
greatly exhausted by marches, privations, and sickness, defeated,
at _Agincourt_, the Constable of France, at the head of the flower
of the French nobility and an army said to amount to 60,000 men,
and gained a complete victory.

During the seventy years’ war between the United Provinces of the
Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy, which commenced in 1578 and
terminated in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable spirit and
firmness;[3] and in the thirty years’ War between the Protestant
Princes and the Emperor of Germany, the British Troops in the
service of Sweden and other states were celebrated for deeds of
heroism.[4] In the wars of Queen Anne, the fame of the British
army under the great MARLBOROUGH was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed within the memory
of persons now living, there is abundant proof that the Britons
of the present age are not inferior to their ancestors in the
qualities which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds of
the brave men, of whom there are many now surviving, who fought in
Egypt in 1801, under the brave Abercromby, and compelled the French
army, which had been vainly styled _Invincible_, to evacuate that
country; also the services of the gallant Troops during the arduous
campaigns in the Peninsula, under the immortal WELLINGTON; and
the determined stand made by the British Army at Waterloo, where
Napoleon Bonaparte, who had long been the inveterate enemy of Great
Britain, and had sought and planned her destruction by every means
he could devise, was compelled to leave his vanquished legions to
their fate, and to place himself at the disposal of the British
Government. These achievements, with others of recent dates in the
distant climes of India, prove that the same valour and constancy
which glowed in the breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers,
Agincourt, Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the Britons
of the nineteenth century.

The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust and muscular
frame,--intrepidity which no danger can appal,--unconquerable
spirit and resolution,--patience in fatigue and privation, and
cheerful obedience to his superiors. These qualities,--united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate and give
a skilful direction to the energies and adventurous spirit of
the hero, and a wise selection of officers of superior talent to
command, whose presence inspires confidence,--have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British arms.[5]
The fame of the deeds of the past and present generations in the
various battle-fields where the robust sons of Albion have fought
and conquered, surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to the end of
time.

The records of the several regiments will be found to contain a
detail of facts of an interesting character, connected with the
hardships, sufferings, and gallant exploits of British soldiers in
the various parts of the world, where the calls of their Country
and the commands of their Sovereign have required them to proceed
in the execution of their duty, whether in active continental
operations, or in maintaining colonial territories in distant and
unfavourable climes.

The superiority of the British infantry has been pre-eminently set
forth in the wars of six centuries, and admitted by the greatest
commanders which Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this _arme_, as at present practised, while they are adapted
to every species of warfare, and to all probable situations and
circumstances of service, are well suited to show forth the
brilliancy of military tactics calculated upon mathematical and
scientific principles. Although the movements and evolutions have
been copied from the continental armies, yet various improvements
have from time to time been introduced, to ensure that simplicity
and celerity by which the superiority of the national military
character is maintained. The rank and influence which Great Britain
has attained among the nations of the world have in a great measure
been purchased by the valour of the Army, and to persons who have
the welfare of their country at heart the records of the several
regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.

The musket carried a ball which weighed 1/10th of a pound; and the
harquebus a ball which weighed 1/25th of a pound.

[2] The 30th, 31st, and 32nd Regiments were formed as Marine corps
in 1702, and were employed as such during the wars in the reign
of Queen Anne. The Marine corps were embarked in the Fleet under
Admiral Sir George Rooke, and were at the taking of Gibraltar, and
in its subsequent defence in 1704; they were afterwards employed at
the siege of Barcelona in 1705.

[3] The brave Sir Roger Williams, in his Discourse on War, printed
in 1590, observes:--“I persuade myself ten thousand of our nation
would beat thirty thousand of theirs (the Spaniards) out of the
field, let them be chosen where they list.” Yet at this time the
Spanish infantry was allowed to be the best disciplined in Europe.
For instances of valour displayed by the British Infantry during
the Seventy Years’ War, see the Historical Record of the Third
Foot, or Buffs.

Foot.

[5] “Under the blessing of Divine Providence, His Majesty ascribes
the successes which have attended the exertions of his troops in
Egypt to that determined bravery which is inherent in Britons; but
His Majesty desires it may be most solemnly and forcibly impressed
on the consideration of every part of the army, that it has been a
strict observance of order, discipline, and military system, which
has given the full energy to the native valour of the troops, and
has enabled them proudly to assert the superiority of the national
military character, in situations uncommonly arduous, and under
circumstances of peculiar difficulty.”--_General Orders in 1801._

In the General Orders issued by Lieut.-General Sir John Hope
(afterwards Lord Hopetoun), congratulating the army upon the
successful result of the Battle of Corunna, on the 16th of January,
1809, it is stated:--“On no occasion has the undaunted valour of
British troops ever been more manifest. At the termination of a
severe and harassing march, rendered necessary by the superiority
which the enemy had acquired, and which had materially impaired
the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages were to be
encountered. These have all been surmounted by the conduct of the
troops themselves; and the enemy has been taught, that, whatever
advantages of position or of numbers he may possess, there is
inherent in the British officers and soldiers a bravery that knows
not how to yield,--that no circumstances can appal,--and that will
ensure victory, when it is to be obtained by the exertion of any
human means.”

  HISTORICAL RECORD

  OF

  THE THIRTY-FIRST, OR THE HUNTINGDONSHIRE,

  REGIMENT OF FOOT.


[Sidenote: 1701]

In the commencement of the eighteenth century, the British Monarch,
King William III., found that the conditions of the Treaty of
Ryswick, concluded in 1697, were violated by the King of France,
Louis XIV., who, on the decease of Charles II. of Spain on the
1st of November, 1700, pursued with unremitting assiduity his
ambitious project of ultimately uniting the crowns of France and
Spain, by procuring the accession of his grandson, Philip, Duke of
Anjou, to the vacant throne; thus excluding the claims of the House
of Austria, and disregarding the existing treaties between the
principal nations of Europe. The seizure of the Spanish Netherlands
by the troops of France,--the detention of the Dutch garrisons in
the barrier towns,--the declaration of Louis XIV. in favour of the
family of James II., and other acts of hostility, justified the
British Government in making preparations for war.

King William had determined on active measures, by sea and land,
against the powers of France and Spain, and had accordingly
directed augmentations to be made in the navy and army. A
division of the army had been appointed, under the command of
Brigadier-General Ingoldsby, (twenty-third regiment,) to embark for
Flanders, and another portion of the army was selected to embark
for the coast of Spain, under the orders of the Duke of Ormond.

[Sidenote: 1702]

The death of King William III. took place on the 8th of March,
1702. His policy was adopted by his successor Queen Anne, who
entered into treaties of alliance with the Emperor of Germany,--the
States-General of the United Provinces,--and other Princes and
Potentates, for preserving the liberty and balance of power in
Europe, and for defeating the ambitious views of France.

The measures for increasing the efficiency of the fleet had
occasioned the suggestion of raising _Corps of Marines_, capable
of acting on land as well as at sea. Several regiments of the
regular army were appointed to serve as Marines, and six additional
regiments were especially raised for that service.[6]

On the 14th of March, 1702, a Royal Warrant was issued, authorising
COLONEL GEORGE VILLIERS to raise a REGIMENT OF MARINES, which was
to consist of twelve companies, of two serjeants, three corporals,
two drummers, and fifty-nine private soldiers each, with an
additional serjeant to the grenadier company. The rendezvous of
the regiment was appointed to be at Taunton and Bridgewater.

For the raising of this regiment the following officers received
commissions, those of the field officers being antedated to the
12th of February, 1702:--

  CAPTAINS            George Villiers (_Colonel_).
                      Alexander Lutterell (_Lt.-Colonel_).
                      Thomas Carew (_Major_).
                      Francis Blinman.
                      George Blakeney.

  CAPTAIN-LIEUTENANT  John Deveroux.

  FIRST LIEUTENANTS   Saloman Balmier.
                      Roger Flower.

  SECOND LIEUTENANT   William Bisset.

  CHIRURGEON          James Church.

  CHIRURGEON’S MATE   William Church.

The declaration of hostilities against France and Spain was issued
on the 4th of May, 1702: thus began, “fruitful in great actions and
important results,” _The War of the Spanish Succession_.

Additional forces were sent to Flanders, and the Earl of
Marlborough was appointed to command the confederate troops with
the rank of Captain-General.

The expedition, which had been planned by King William against
Spain, was carried out by the Ministers of Queen Anne. It was
arranged, accordingly, that a combined fleet of English and Dutch
ships, consisting of fifty sail of the line, besides frigates,
under Admiral Sir George Rooke, and a land force amounting to
nearly fourteen thousand men, under the command of the Duke of
Ormond, should proceed to the coast of Spain. The following corps
were employed on this service, namely:--

                                                             Officers

                                                               9653

                                                             13,577

Colonel Villiers’s Corps of Marines, now the THIRTY-FIRST regiment,
soon after its formation was thus called upon to supply five
Companies for embarkation for active service on board the fleet
destined against Spain: these Companies embarked in the latter
part of May from Plymouth, and proceeded to join the fleet at
Portsmouth, from whence the expedition sailed to Cadiz in the month
of July, 1702.

The armament appeared off Cadiz on the 12th of August, and the
Duke summoned the place; but his terms being refused, he landed on
the 15th at the Bay of Bulls, between Rota and Fort St. Catherine,
under great disadvantages and a well conducted opposition: he
marched upon Rota, where the horses and stores were disembarked,
and in two days afterwards he advanced to the town of St. Mary.
Rota was retaken by a _coup-de-main_, and the British garrison of
300 men was captured. The attempt on Cadiz failed; the troops were
re-embarked, and sailed from Cadiz on the 30th of September.

In alluding to this expedition, Bishop Burnet remarks,--“It is
certain our Court had false accounts of the state the place was in,
both with relation to the garrison, and to the fortifications; the
garrison was much stronger, and the fortifications were in a better
state, than was represented.”

Conspicuous as the bravery of the troops had been in the expedition
against Cadiz, still the failure of the attempt naturally caused
painful feelings to arise among the British soldiers, who were
disappointed of reaping the well-earned fame of a successful
enterprise, when victory appeared almost within their grasp. The
receipt of information of the arrival of a Spanish fleet from
the West Indies, under a French convoy, at the harbour of Vigo,
speedily dissipated these feelings, and gave renewed hopes to the
troops. The allied fleet immediately bent its course thither,
and arrived before Vigo on the 22nd of October, 1702. The French
admiral Count de Chateaurenaud had placed his shipping and the
galleons within a narrow passage, the entrance to which was
defended by a castle on one side, and by platforms mounted with
cannon on both sides of the inlet; a strong boom was thrown across
the harbour.

To facilitate the attack on this formidable barrier, the Duke of
Ormond landed a portion of his army six miles from Vigo on the
23rd of October, and took, by assault, a battery of forty pieces
of cannon, situated at the entrance of the bay. A British flag,
hoisted on this fort, was the signal for a general attack. The
fleet in full sail approached, broke the boom at the first shock,
and became closely engaged with the enemy’s ships, while the
British troops that had landed, stormed and captured the batteries.
After a vigorous defence, the French and Spaniards, finding they
could not escape, set fire to some of their vessels, and cast their
cargoes into the sea; but the British exerted themselves nobly in
extinguishing the flames, and succeeded in saving six galleons and
seven ships of war. Two thousand of the enemy are stated to have
perished, and the Spaniards sustained a loss in goods and treasure
exceeding eight million dollars, more than one-half of which fell
to the captors, whose loss in this victory was inconsiderable.
Queen Anne, attended by the Lords and Commons, went in state to St.
Paul’s Cathedral to return thanks for this success, and each of the
regiments of infantry received 561_l._ 10_s._ prize-money.

Villiers’s Marines (THIRTY-FIRST regiment) did not land at Vigo,
but served on board the fleet in this gallant enterprise.

The troops under the Duke of Ormond subsequently returned to
England, and on their arrival in November, 1702, were stationed as
follows, namely:--

  Lloyd’s 3rd Dragoons (detachment)      Portsmouth.
  Foot Guards, 1st and Coldstream        Gravesend and Chatham.
  Sir H. Bellasis’s    2nd Foot          Portsmouth.
  Churchill’s          3rd  ”            Chatham.
  Seymour’s            4th  ”            Plymouth.
  Columbine’s          6th  ”            Portsmouth.
  Royal Fusiliers      7th  ”            Tilbury.
  VILLIERS’S (Marines) THIRTY-FIRST      PLYMOUTH.
  Fox’s Marines        32nd Foot         Plymouth.
  Viscount Shannon’s Marines             Chatham.

[Sidenote: 1703]

On the 6th of January, 1703, seven companies of the regiment were
stationed at Plymouth, and on the 27th of that month four companies
were ordered for embarkation on board of the ships Suffolk and
Grafton, which proceeded on service to the coast of Spain, to join
the fleet under Admiral Sir George Rooke, and continued in that
quarter, and in the Mediterranean, during that year.

In December, 1703, Colonel Villiers, who was in command of the
Regiment on board of the fleet, was drowned. He was succeeded
in the Colonelcy of the Regiment by Lieut.-Colonel Alexander
Lutterell, on the 6th of December of that year.

[Sidenote: 1704]

The THIRTY-FIRST regiment, being at this time a Marine Corps,
continued to serve on board the fleet in the Mediterranean, and
in February, 1704, proceeded, under Admiral Sir George Rooke,
to Lisbon, from whence it proceeded to _Barcelona_, where the
troops were landed under the command of Major-General the Prince
of Hesse-Darmstadt, on the 19th of May; but the force, being
inadequate for the purpose intended, was re-embarked on the day
following.

The fleet next proceeded to attack the fortress of _Gibraltar_, and
the Prince of Hesse effected a landing on the afternoon of the 21st
of July, 1704, with eighteen hundred BRITISH AND DUTCH MARINES:
after a bombardment of three days, the governor was forced to
capitulate, and the Prince of Hesse took possession of the garrison
on the evening of Sunday, the 24th of July, 1704. The attack of
the seamen and marines is recorded in history to have been one of
the boldest and most difficult ever performed. The _fortress_ of
_Gibraltar_ was thus taken, and was besieged by the Spaniards and
French in October following, for seven months, during which period
it was successfully defended by the navy and marines, and has since
remained, as a monument of British valour, in possession of the
Crown of Great Britain.

After selecting a sufficient force to garrison Gibraltar, the
Marine Corps were distributed in the several ships of war which
were then collected in the Tagus, in order to co-operate with the
land forces on the coast of Spain.

[Sidenote: 1705]

Towards the end of May, 1705, the British fleet having about five
thousand troops on board, with General the Earl of Peterborough,
proceeded to Lisbon; King Charles embarked on board of the Ranelagh
on the 23rd of July, and the Dutch fleet having joined in the
Tagus, proceeded from thence, and anchored before Barcelona on the
22nd of August.

The Earl of Peterborough commenced operations against _Barcelona_
by an attack on the strong fortress of _Montjuich_, which was taken
by storm on the 17th of September. In this attack the Prince of
Hesse Darmstadt was wounded by a musket-ball which occasioned his
death. The city of Barcelona was invested, and after considerable
efforts on the part of the besiegers and the besieged, the garrison
surrendered on the 6th of October, 1705.

The capture of _Barcelona_ obtained for the allied forces the
applause of the nations of Europe, and in a great degree promoted
the cause of King Charles in his efforts to succeed to the Crown of
Spain.

[Sidenote: 1706]

The decease of Colonel Lutterell having taken place, he was
succeeded by Lieut.-Colonel Josiah Churchill, on the 1st of
February, 1706.

The neglect of King Charles III. and his counsellors to secure
the advantages obtained by the conquests before stated, and the
persevering efforts made in favour of King Philip V. by the French,
and by those persons in other countries who supported his cause,
occasioned great difficulties, as well as serious losses to the
allied forces.

A powerful French and Spanish force by land, aided by a fleet,
attempted the recapture of _Barcelona_, which was besieged in the
beginning of April, 1706; but when the enemy had made preparations
to attack the place by storm, the English and Dutch fleet arrived
with reinforcements for the garrison;--the French relaxed in their
efforts, and the siege was raised on the 11th of May.

The city of Barcelona was thus relieved, and the allied fleet, with
the troops on board, proceeded to the coast of Valencia; after
capturing _Carthagena_, and placing six hundred Marines for its
defence, the expedition proceeded to an attack upon _Alicant_,
which, after a gallant resistance and severe loss, surrendered on
the 25th of August, 1706.

The fleet then proceeded to _Iviça_ and _Majorca_, which
surrendered to King Charles III., and detachments of Marines were
placed as garrisons in those islands.

[Sidenote: 1707]

The defeat of the allied forces under the Earl of Galway by the
Duke of Berwick at _Almanza_, on the 25th of April, 1707, cast a
gloom over the prospects of King Charles in Spain; and in June
following, measures were adopted for co-operating with the Duke of
Savoy and the Prince Eugene, in an attack upon Toulon. The fleet
proceeded for the coast of Italy, and anchored between Nice and
Antibes, when a conference took place with the commanders-in-chief
of the sea and land forces, and it was decided that a joint
attack should be made upon a portion of the enemy’s army which
was entrenched upon the river Var; the enemy having evacuated
his positions, they were immediately occupied by several hundred
British seamen and marines; the passage was thus secured for the
Duke of Savoy to prosecute his designs, and ships were stationed
along different parts of the sea-coast: every aid was afforded
by the fleet; but the enemy, having been reinforced, made a
successful sally, and the allied forces sustained considerable
loss; the siege was consequently raised on the 10th of August
following.

[Sidenote: 1708]

In consequence of King Charles having desired that _Sardinia_
should be reduced, with a view to a passage being opened for his
troops into Naples to attack Sicily, and also to secure the means
of supplying provisions for his armies, it was decided that a body
of _marines_ should be withdrawn from Catalonia to assist in this
enterprise. On the 12th of August, 1708, the armament designed for
this service arrived before _Cagliari_, the capital of Sardinia,
and after receiving a hesitating reply to the summons to surrender,
the bombardment commenced on that evening, and continued until the
following morning, when, at the break of day, Major-General Wills
(Thirtieth regiment), at the head of the Marines, with one Spanish
regiment, landed, and the place surrendered.

It was next decided that an attempt should be made upon the island
of _Minorca_. The fleet accordingly set sail, and arrived before
_Port Mahon_ on the 28th of August, 1708.

At this period the six _marine_ regiments had been much reduced in
numbers by the arduous services on which they had been employed
from the commencement of the war, so that it became necessary
to draft the men of _two_ of these corps into the other four
regiments, in order to render this force effective for the service
for which it was now destined, and which, there was reason to
expect, would be difficult, and would require the most energetic
measures towards effecting the conquest of the island. For this
purpose all the Marines fit for service, were drawn from the ships
about to return home, and were incorporated in the four regiments
which were employed in the reduction of this island. The two
regiments (Holl’s and Shannon’s) returned to England in order to
recruit their numbers.

The fleet proceeded to commence operations, and the first attack
was against _Fort Fornelle_, which was cannonaded, and surrendered
after a contest of four hours; a detachment proceeded to
_Citadella_, the capital, which surrendered; batteries, which had
been erected, were opened on the works defending the town of _Port
Mahon_, on the 17th of September, when, after a short but brisk
fire, a lodgment was effected under the walls of St. _Philip’s
Castle_, and on the following day the place surrendered.

The valuable and important _Island of Minorca_ was thus reduced
to submission to the British Crown by the gallantry of the Navy,
and about two thousand four hundred Marines; the island, which was
ceded to Great Britain at the Treaty of Utrecht, in 1713, continued
in the British possession until the year 1756, when it was
recaptured by a combined Spanish and French force under the command
of Marshal the Duke de Richelieu.[7]

[Sidenote: 1709]

In the early part of the year 1709, an armament was prepared
for the purpose of attacking _Port Royal_ in the province of
_Nova Scotia_, which was then in possession of the French; the
expedition was entrusted to Colonel Nicholson of the Marines, and
to Captain Martin of the Navy. The squadron proceeded to Boston,
where it was reinforced by some ships, and by provincial auxiliary
troops: a council of war was held, and arrangements were made for
disembarking the troops, which took place on the 24th of September.
The fortress surrendered on the 1st of October, and the Marines
took possession. The fortress was named _Anna-polis Royal_, in
honor of Queen Anne, in whose reign the conquest was effected.

The affairs of Spain at this time had materially changed, and
the prospects of King Charles III. in obtaining the monarchy had
become very doubtful. The town of _Alicant_, after sustaining a
powerful siege by the forces of Spain and France, was compelled
to surrender in April; the fleet under Admiral Sir George Byng,
and the troops on board under Lieut.-General Stanhope, which
were destined for its relief, were prevented, by heavy gales and
severe weather, from communicating with the town, and affording the
desired assistance. The garrison consisted of Colonel Sir Charles
Hotham’s and Colonel Frederick Sybourg’s regiments (afterwards
disbanded), together with a large body of Marines, who evinced
the most heroic perseverance in maintaining the place. On the 6th
of April, 1709, the enemy sprung a mine, which split the rock on
which the _Castle of Alicant_ was situated, when Colonel Sybourg
and several other officers were swallowed up in the opening, which
immediately closed. Although they had been permitted to see the
mine, they refused to capitulate; the garrison afterwards continued
to defend the castle, until Lieut.-General Stanhope, being unable
to communicate with the town, proposed terms of surrender, which
being acceded to, the gallant survivors of the siege were conveyed
on board the fleet, and were removed to Minorca, and afterwards to
Barcelona.

[Sidenote: 1710]

In March, 1710, Admiral Sir John Norris, who had arrived at Port
Mahon as commander-in-chief of the Naval forces, proceeded to
Barcelona, in the month of June, in order to concert with King
Charles III. the plan of future operations. It was determined
that an expedition should proceed against the _Isle of Cette_ in
the province of Languedoc. His troops, including the Marines,
landed on the 13th of July, and after a feeble resistance the fort
surrendered: the regiment of Stanhope and three hundred Marines
advanced against _Agde_, and the town surrendered. The _Isle of
Cette_ was shortly afterwards recaptured by the French, but the
British troops had been previously re-embarked.

[Sidenote: 1711]

Colonel Churchill having received Her Majesty’s permission to
sell his commission, Lieut.-Colonel Sir Harry Goring, Bart., was
promoted to the Colonelcy of the THIRTY-FIRST Regiment by purchase,
on the 1st of March, 1711.

The decease of Joseph I., Emperor of Germany, took place on the
17th of April, 1711, and King Charles III. of Spain was elected
Emperor of Germany, by the title of Charles VI., on the 12th of
October of that year: this circumstance rendered unnecessary any
further attempts in the cause of King Charles on the part of the
British Government. His Majesty embarked at Barcelona on board
of the fleet, and proceeded to assume the duties of the Imperial
throne.

[Sidenote: 1712]

[Sidenote: 1713]

In the year 1712 negotiations were entered into between Great
Britain and France, and a Treaty of Peace was concluded at Utrecht,
on the 11th of April, 1713. By this treaty it was settled, that
Great Britain should retain possession of Gibraltar, Minorca,
and Nova Scotia, which had been conquered during the war, and in
acquiring which the _Marine_ Corps had greatly contributed.

From the period of the formation of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, in
the year 1702, as a _Corps of Marines_, to the termination of the
war by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the regiment was employed,
by detachments, on board the fleet, and was engaged on various
services at sea, as well as on land, according to the conditions on
which it was raised.[8]

Among the reductions which were directed to take place in the
establishment of the army consequent on the Peace of Utrecht,
the _Marine Corps_ were included in the list of regiments to be
discontinued.

[Sidenote: 1714]

The decease of Queen Anne took place on the 1st of August, 1714,
and King George I., who was then at Hanover, was immediately
proclaimed as the Sovereign of Great Britain and Ireland. The
partisans of the Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart, son of the
late King, James II., renewed their exertions in his behalf; and
Jacobite principles had become so prevalent in certain parts of
the kingdom, that it was necessary that the army, which had been
considerably reduced after the Peace of Utrecht, should be again
augmented.

Six additional regiments of cavalry (from the ninth to the
fourteenth dragoons) were raised. The establishments of the
regiments of infantry were increased, and, in consideration of
the services of the Marine Corps during the late war, Wills’s,
now _thirtieth_,--Goring’s, now _thirty-first_,--and Borr’s, now
_thirty-second_, which had been ordered to be disbanded, were
retained on the establishment, and were incorporated with the
regiments of infantry of the line, and authorised to take rank
according to the dates of their original formation in 1702.

[Sidenote: 1715]

The adherents of the Stuart dynasty continued to be numerous,
particularly in Scotland, where active preparations were made
for the elevation of the “_Pretender_” to the throne; and the
_Chevalier de St. George_[9] (so styled in France) repeated the
attempt which he had made in 1708, and effected a landing in
Scotland in December, 1715, where a rebellion had broken out in
September; the Earl of Mar had assembled his vassals, erected the
standard of the Pretender in the Highlands, and had been joined
by several clans, to the number of ten thousand men. King George
I. was supported by his Parliament in adopting energetic measures
for opposing the designs of the Jacobites, and for maintaining the
Protestant Succession.

To oppose the rebellious forces, the Duke of Argyle was appointed
to the command of the army in Scotland. After several movements
and skirmishing, the rebel army, commanded by the Earl of Mar,
advanced, in the early part of November, towards the Firth; and
the Duke of Argyle quitted the camp at Stirling, and proceeded
to the vicinity of _Dumblaine_. On the morning of Sunday, the
13th of November, the hostile armies confronted each other on
_Sheriffmuir_. After half-an-hour’s sharp fighting the left wing
of the rebel army gave way, and the King’s troops captured several
standards and colours; but while this portion of the rebel army
was being pursued, the rebels had defeated the left wing of the
royal army. Thus each commander had a wing triumphant and a wing
defeated: both armies returned to their former ground, but the
action was not renewed. The rebels were, however, defeated in their
design of crossing the Firth, and they retired, during the night,
towards Perth. The royal army returned to Stirling on the following
day. The rebels who had assembled in England under the Earl of
Derwentwater and Mr. Forster, were also compelled to surrender at
Preston, in Lancashire, to General Carpenter, on the same day as
the battle of Sheriffmuir was fought.

Towards the end of December the “_Pretender_” arrived in Scotland,
but his presence did not animate the Scots sufficiently to induce
them to renew the contest in his behalf; they considered him unfit
to be the leader of a great military enterprise, although the
Chevalier is recorded in history to have greatly distinguished
himself in the battle of Malplaquet in 1709, “when he charged
twelve times with the household troops of the King of France,
and, in the last charge, was wounded in the arm by a sword.” The
Chevalier had the credit of possessing plenty of animal courage,
when led by others, but no moral fortitude when left to himself,
and dependent upon his own resources.[10]

[Sidenote: 1716]

In the latter part of the year 1715 the royal army had been joined
by considerable reinforcements, and in January, 1716, the Duke of
Argyle advanced towards Perth.

The Pretender and the Earl of Mar, being unable to oppose effectual
resistance, and seeing no prospect of establishing a footing
in Scotland, withdrew from their army privately, and escaped to
France, after which the Highlanders dispersed.

The rebellion in Scotland at this period thus terminated.

The THIRTY-FIRST regiment proceeded to Ireland, and continued to
form a part of the force in that portion of the United Kingdom
until the year 1739.

On the retirement of Colonel Sir _Harry Goring_, on the 8th of
September, 1716, Lord John Kerr was appointed to the Colonelcy of
the regiment.

The remainder of the reign of King George I. did not produce any
events to give occasion for the active services of the army, and
the movements of regiments from one station to another seldom took
place.

[Sidenote: 1727]

His Majesty’s decease occurred on the 11th of June, 1727, and his
son, King George II., succeeded to the throne.

[Sidenote: 1728]

Major-General Lord John Kerr died on the 1st of August, 1728, and
on the 13th of that month, Colonel the Honorable Charles Cathcart,
from the Ninth foot, was appointed to the Colonelcy of the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment.

[Sidenote: 1731]

Colonel William Hargrave was promoted on the 1st of January,
1731, from the Seventh Royal Fusiliers to the Colonelcy of the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment, in succession to Colonel the Honorable
Charles Cathcart, who was removed to the Eighth dragoons.

[Sidenote: 1737]

On the 27th of January, 1737, Colonel William Handasyd was promoted
from the Fifteenth foot to the Colonelcy of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment, in succession to Colonel William Hargrave, who was
removed to the Ninth foot.

[Sidenote: 1739]

In the year 1739 the THIRTY-FIRST regiment was removed from Ireland
to Great Britain.

[Sidenote: 1740]

In the two previous years the British merchants had made great
complaints against the Spanish depredations in America, and on the
23rd of October, 1739, war was proclaimed against Spain by Great
Britain; and the events which occurred in Germany in the following
year occasioned the contest that is designated the “War of the
Austrian Succession,” in which most of the European powers became
engaged, and which disturbed the long interval of comparative peace
that had succeeded the Treaty of Utrecht.[11]

These events were occasioned by the decease of Charles VI.,
Emperor of Germany, on the 20th of October, 1740. The Emperor was
the last Prince of the House of Austria, and he was succeeded in
his hereditary dominions by his eldest daughter, the Archduchess
Maria Theresa, who married, in 1736, the Duke Francis Stephen, of
Lorraine. The Duke, in the following year, became Grand-Duke of
Tuscany. Immediately on her father’s decease, Maria Theresa was
proclaimed Queen of Hungary and Bohemia, Princess of Transylvania,
Archduchess of Austria, and universal successor to all the
dominions of the House of Austria, pursuant to the “_Pragmatic
Sanction_;”[12] and she declared her husband co-regent in the
government of her dominions.

Although the possessions of Austria were guaranteed to the
Archduchess Maria Theresa by the German Edict known in history
as the “_Pragmatic Sanction_,” to which nearly all the powers of
Europe had been parties, yet the succession of the Archduchess
to her father’s Austrian hereditary territories was disputed by
several claimants; and among others by Charles Albert, Elector of
Bavaria, who was afterwards elected Emperor of Germany. The King of
Prussia also revived a dormant claim to Silesia, which he invaded
in November; the Prussian monarch offered Maria Theresa sufficient
money to resist all her enemies, on condition of ceding Silesia to
him, but the proposition was indignantly rejected.

[Sidenote: 1741]

The King of France supported the Elector of Bavaria, while King
George II. supported the Archduchess Maria Theresa; and in April,
1741, the British Parliament voted a subsidy of 300,000_l._ to
the Queen of Hungary and Bohemia. His Majesty also informed the
Parliament, that the Queen of Hungary had demanded the twelve
thousand troops he had stipulated to furnish; and accordingly
he had requested the King of Denmark and the King of Sweden to
hold in readiness their quotas of six thousand men each, for the
maintenance of which they had received subsidies from England. King
George II. was drawn into the war from the apprehension of losing
Hanover, but at this period His Majesty abstained from being a
principal in the contest, by agreeing with the French sovereign,
Louis XV., to give his vote, as Elector of Hanover, to the Elector
of Bavaria for the dignity of Emperor of Germany, and thereby to
preserve the neutrality of his Hanoverian territories.

During 1741 and the previous year the regiment was encamped at
Windsor, and on Lexden Heath, near Colchester, as part of the force
ordered to be prepared for the assistance of Maria Theresa, but no
embarkation for continental service took place during the year 1741.

[Sidenote: 1742]

The Elector of Bavaria was chosen Emperor of Germany at Frankfort
on the Maine, and crowned, as Charles VII., on the 11th of
February, 1742: he was, however, a most unhappy prince; his
electoral dominions were overrun by the Austrians, the French were
driven out of Bohemia, and the King of Prussia, under the mediation
of King George II., concluded a peace at Breslau with the Queen of
Hungary.

The King of England resolving to take a more active part in the
war, an army of sixteen thousand men, under Field-Marshal the Earl
of Stair, was ordered to be embarked for the Netherlands in the
summer of 1742, in order to support the Queen of Hungary.

On the 17th of May the THIRTY-FIRST regiment embarked at Deptford
for Flanders, having been previously reviewed on Kew-green by King
George II. and the Duke of Cumberland, with the other regiments
destined for the above service.[13] No action took place during
the year, the troops being suddenly marched into winter-quarters,
after every preparation had been made for active operations.

[Sidenote: 1743]

In the commencement of the year 1743 the British and Hanoverian
troops were assembled in the Low Countries, commanded by
Field-Marshal the Earl of Stair, as _allies_ to the Austrians,
under the command of Marshal Neuperg and the Duke d’Aremberg, and
advanced towards Germany, in order to secure the navigation of the
Upper Maine. The French Marshal, Noailles, had anticipated the
British general, and was already on the opposite shore of this
river, and in possession of its principal posts when the Allies
arrived at Aschaffenberg. Here the Allied army remained until June,
on the 19th of which month King George II., attended by the Duke of
Cumberland, arrived at the camp.

The two armies were encamped on the plains near the banks of the
Maine, opposite to, and in sight of, each other; with a ridge of
hills, covered with woods on the north of each, the Allies being
on the north and the French on the south side of the river. The
Confederate army amounted to nearly forty thousand men, in high
spirits, though nearly destitute of provisions. A retrograde
movement being resolved on for the purpose of obtaining supplies,
as well as to effect a junction with a corps of twelve thousand
Hessians and Hanoverians, in some danger of being cut off at Hanau,
His Majesty, on the evening of the 26th of June, gave orders
that the army should hold itself in readiness to march on the
following morning; accordingly the Confederate army marched towards
_Dettingen_ before daylight on the morning of the 27th of June. The
army was weakened for want of provisions, the soldiers having been
on half-rations for some time, and the horses were without forage.

Marshal Noailles immediately ordered a large force of cavalry and
infantry, composed of the household troops and of the Royal Guards,
to the village of _Dettingen_, by which the British had to pass.
The THIRTY-FIRST regiment, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Montague, was in advance towards Dettingen, when the French made
the above movement, and gave the first intelligence of it to His
Majesty.

Aschaffenberg was occupied by the French the moment it was
evacuated by the Allies. The Confederate army had to march through
a narrow way between a mountain and the Maine, the cannon on the
opposite side of the river commanding its flank. Dettingen, in
front, was occupied in force by the French, and also Aschaffenberg
in the rear. In this situation the destruction of the Allies seemed
inevitable; but Marshal Noailles having repassed the river, the
Duke de Grammont, who succeeded to the command, advanced to the
attack through the defile, thus relinquishing all the advantages of
his position. The British troops, animated by the presence of their
Sovereign, on the 27th of June, received the impetuous attack of
the French with such steadiness and intrepidity, that the latter
were forced to retire, and recross the Maine with the greatest
precipitation and the loss of five thousand men.

The Twentieth and THIRTY-FIRST regiments were in reserve in a
wood on the British right, and towards the afternoon they were
led into action by his Majesty in person, who evinced the same
martial qualities for which he was distinguished at the battle of
Oudenarde, on the 11th of July, 1708, when Hereditary Prince of
Brunswick Lunenburg.

The regiment sustained but trifling loss at the battle of
Dettingen, in consequence of its having been in reserve during the
early part of the action.[14]

Although the victory was highly honorable to those by whom it was
gained, yet it was productive of no decisive results.[15] The
allied army continued its march to Hanau; it subsequently crossed
the Rhine, and was employed in West Germany, but returned to
Flanders for winter-quarters.

[Sidenote: 1744]

On the 20th of March, 1744, France declared war against England,
and on the 29th of that month a counter-declaration was made by
Great Britain, in which the French monarch was accused of violating
the “_Pragmatic Sanction_,” and of assisting the son of the
Pretender in his designs on the British throne.

The regiment served the campaign of 1744 with the army commanded
by Field-Marshal Wade; it was encamped some time on the banks of
the Scheldt, and afterwards penetrated the French territory to the
vicinity of Lisle, but no general engagement occurred.

[Sidenote: 1745]

In January, 1745, the Emperor Charles VII. died at Munich, and
Francis, Grand-Duke of Tuscany, consort of Maria Theresa, became a
candidate for the Imperial crown; this event changed the aspect of
affairs in Germany, and led to the re-establishment of the House of
Austria in the Imperial dignity.

Colonel Lord Henry Beauclerk was appointed, on the 22nd of April,
1745, from the forty-eighth to the Colonelcy of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment, in succession to Colonel W. Handasyd, deceased.

His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland was appointed to the
command of the Confederate army, and on the French investing
Tournay, which towards the end of April was besieged by an immense
force, under Marshal Count de Saxe, His Royal Highness determined
to raise the siege, which resulted in the battle of _Fontenoy_.

On the morning of the 11th of May, the formidable position at
_Fontenoy_, occupied by the superior numbers of the enemy, was
attacked, when the British infantry evinced that heroism for
which that _arme_ of the service has ever been conspicuous, and
forced the enemy’s position; but being exposed to a destructive
cross-fire, in consequence of the Dutch having failed in their
attack on the village of Fontenoy, and Brigadier-General Ingoldsby
not having captured a battery in the wood of Barry, the British
regiments, which had forced the French position, were ordered to
retire. The attack was repeated, with the same results: British
valour was conspicuous, but the failure of the Dutch rendered a
retreat necessary, and the Allied army withdrew to Aeth.[16]

In the London Gazette it was stated that,

  “The Highland regiment (42nd), the regiment late Handasyd’s
  (THIRTY-FIRST), Duroure’s (12th), and many others also
  distinguished themselves. The honor gained by the Infantry
  was in a great measure owing to the conduct and bravery of
  Lieut.-General Ligonier.”

It was the practice at this period in all the armies of Europe
to form battalions of _Grenadiers_ of the different regiments
composing the force in the field; it was their privilege to lead
upon all arduous occasions, when they were ever conspicuous, and
suffered the most. The _grenadier_ company of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment brought only _eleven_ men out of the field of Fontenoy,
of the seventy-five that it took into action, and its captain and
subalterns were killed.

The THIRTY-FIRST regiment had Lieut.-Colonel Montague, Captains
Baird and Pollock, Lieutenant Dalway, four serjeants, and one
hundred and twenty-five rank and file _killed_; Lieutenants
Stafford and Porter, Ensigns Worsley, Bromley, and Freeman, six
serjeants, and one hundred and thirty rank and file, _wounded_.

Tournay made a gallant defence until the 21st of June, when it
surrendered to Marshal Saxe.

After the battle of Fontenoy the Allied army encamped at Lessines
and Grammont, when a demonstration being made by the French to
attack the Confederates, it was concentrated at the latter place,
in order to receive them. After exchanging a few cannon-shots, the
enemy withdrew, showing a disposition to surround the Allies, which
determined the Duke of Cumberland to fall back on Brussels.

The Confederate generals suspected that the French would make an
attempt upon Ghent, and therefore despatched Lieut.-General Baron
de Molck to Ghent to reinforce the garrison of that fortress. The
troops appointed for this service were Sir Robert Rich’s (fourth)
dragoons, three squadrons of Slipperbach’s dragoons, and two
squadrons of the regiments of Ligne and Styrum, and seven hundred
hussars; with a battalion of the Royal regiment of foot, and
Bligh’s and HANDASYD’S regiments (Twentieth and THIRTY-FIRST foot);
in all about four thousand men.

The Baron de Molck led his column along the cause-way of Alost,
until he reached the Priory of _Melle_ (_Pas du Mésle_), when it
was suddenly assailed by a volley from two batteries near the
priory, and the next moment from ten to fifteen thousand French
sprang from their concealment among the trees and surrounded the
detachment. The Baron de Molck attacked them with such resolution,
that he forced a passage, and arrived safely in Ghent with the
fourth dragoons, the Royals, and the hussars. Brigadier Bligh,
finding it impossible to follow the Lieut.-General, drew off to the
right with his own regiment (the 20th), the THIRTY-FIRST, and the
Austrian and Dutch dragoons, forced a passage through the enemy,
gained an adjacent wood, and retired thence to Dendermond, twelve
miles east of Ghent. The loss of the Allies amounted to about six
hundred men. This action, which was fought on the 9th of July, is
called by the French the combat of _La Mésle_. In the account of
this affair published at the time, it was stated that “our troops
behaved with incredible bravery, and have acquired immortal honor.”
Ghent was shortly afterwards taken by the French.

The allied army remained entrenched between Antwerp and Brussels
until the French Marshal had reduced the chief fortified places in
Austrian Flanders.[17]

On the 2nd of September the Grand-Duke of Tuscany was elected
Emperor of Germany, by the title of Francis I. At this period the
rebellion in Scotland began to assume a formidable aspect. Prince
Charles Edward, eldest son of the Pretender, who had arrived in
the Highlands towards the end of July, had been joined by several
clans, and on the 16th of September proclaimed his father King of
Great Britain, at Edinburgh. The success gained over the Royal
army, under Lieutenant-General Sir John Cope, at _Preston-Pans_, on
the 21st of September, caused numerous adherents to flock to the
Prince’s standard.

Several regiments were in consequence recalled from the Continent,
and the THIRTY-FIRST, with other corps, arrived in the river Thames
on the 25th of October.[18]

The THIRTY-FIRST regiment, which had been much reduced by its
casualties during the campaigns in Flanders, did not proceed
to Scotland, but remained in the vicinity of London. The young
Pretender marched as far as Derby, from whence he commenced his
retreat to the north on the 6th of December, as he found but few
partisans in England to join him in his expedition.

[Sidenote: 1746]

On the 16th of April, 1746, a decisive blow was given to the hopes
of the Pretender by the defeat of the rebels at _Culloden_. Prince
Charles, after enduring many hardships, escaped to France.

[Sidenote: 1747]

Several regiments were now ordered to return to Flanders, but the
THIRTY-FIRST remained in Great Britain. On the 2nd of July, 1747,
the Duke of Cumberland engaged the French at _Laffeld_, or _Val_,
where the Allies suffered severely from the misconduct of the Dutch
troops.

[Sidenote: 1748]

In the summer of 1748 the Allies again took the field, but
hostilities were at length terminated by the treaty of
Aix-la-Chapelle, which was signed on the 7th of October, 1748. By
it all the great treaties, from that of Westphalia in 1648, which
first recognised the principle of a balance of power in Europe, to
that of Vienna in 1738 were renewed and confirmed. Prussia retained
Silesia, and the Empress-Queen, Maria Theresa, was guaranteed
in the possession of her hereditary dominions, according to the
Pragmatic Sanction. France surrendered her conquests in Flanders,
and England those in the East and West Indies; all therefore Great
Britain gained by the war was the glory of having supported the
German sovereignty of Maria Theresa, and of having adhered to
former treaties.

[Sidenote: 1749]

Colonel Henry Holmes was appointed by King George II. to the
Colonelcy of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment on the 8th of May, 1749, in
succession to Colonel Lord Henry Beauclerk, who retired from the
service.

In the year 1749 the THIRTY-FIRST regiment was embarked for
Minorca, where it remained for the three following years.

[Sidenote: 1751]

In the Royal Warrant, dated the 1st of July, 1751, for ensuring
uniformity in the clothing, standards, and colours of the army,
and regulating the number and rank of regiments, the facings of
the THIRTY-FIRST regiment were directed to be _Buff_. The first,
or King’s colour, was the Great Union; the second, or Regimental
colour, was of _Buff_ silk, with the Union in the upper canton; in
the centre of the colour the number of the rank of the regiment, in

[Sidenote: 1752]

In 1752 the regiment returned to England from Minorca.

[Sidenote: 1753]

[Sidenote: 1754]

During the years 1753 and 1754 the THIRTY-FIRST regiment was
stationed in England.

[Sidenote: 1755]

In the year 1755 the regiment proceeded to Scotland, in which
country it remained for seven years.

[Sidenote: 1756]

While the regiment was stationed in North Britain, the Peace of
Aix-la-Chapelle was interrupted by the aggressions of the French
on the British territory in North America, and early in 1756 the
King of France prepared a powerful armament for the capture of
the island of Minorca. In consequence of this attack on Minorca,
hostilities became inevitable on the part of Great Britain, and on
the 18th of May war was declared against France.

The garrison of Minorca, consisting of the 4th, 23rd, 24th, and
34th regiments, after making a noble and vigorous defence, which
called forth the unqualified admiration of their opponents, was
forced to surrender on the 29th of June.

At this period the army and navy were increased, and among other
augmentations, fifteen of the regiments of infantry were authorised
to raise second battalions from the 25th of August, 1756.

[Sidenote: 1758]

In 1758 these additional battalions were formed into distinct
corps, and numbered from the sixty-first to the seventy-fifth
regiment. By this arrangement, the second battalion of the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment was constituted the present _Seventieth_
regiment.[19]

[Sidenote: 1759]

The THIRTY-FIRST regiment, having been selected to remain in the
United Kingdom, was precluded from taking a part in _The Seven
Years’ War_, the most memorable occurrences of which were, the
battle of _Plassey_, gained in India by Colonel Clive, on the 23rd
of June, 1757, which laid the foundation of the British dominion
in India; in Germany, the battle of _Minden_, which was fought on
the 1st of August, 1759; in North America, the capture of _Cape
Breton_, in July, 1758; and the capture of _Quebec_, in September,
1759, which cost the life of the gallant _General Wolfe_, but
which led to the conquest of _Canada_ in the following year, when
_Montreal_, with the whole of that country, surrendered to General
Amherst, in September, 1760.

[Sidenote: 1760]

In Germany several hard-fought but indecisive actions occurred: the
battle of Warbourg, on the 31st of July, 1760; the action near the
Convent of Campen, on the 16th of October following; and the battle
of Kirch Denkern, or Fellinghausen, on the 15th and 16th of July,
1761. In the following year actions were fought at Wilhelmstahl and
at Amonebourg; the former on the 24th of June, and the latter on
the 21st of September.

[Sidenote: 1762]

On the 4th of January, 1762, war was declared against Spain; and
Martinique, Grenada, St. Vincent, and other West India islands
surrendered to English valour. The important city of Havannah, in
Cuba, also capitulated to the British arms.

These successes were followed by a Treaty of Peace, the preliminary
articles of which were signed at Fontainebleau, by the Duke of
Bedford, on the 3rd of November, 1762.

In June, 1762, the THIRTY-FIRST regiment proceeded from Scotland to
England, where it was stationed during the two following years.

On the 20th of August, 1762, Colonel James Adolphus Oughton, from
the fifty-fifth regiment, was appointed by His Majesty King George
III. to the Colonelcy of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, in succession
to Lieutenant-General Henry Holmes, deceased.

[Sidenote: 1763]

The treaty of Fontainebleau was concluded at Paris on the 10th of
February, the ratifications were exchanged on the 10th of March,
and peace was proclaimed in London on the 22nd of that month.

By this treaty, the whole of Canada, part of Louisiana, together
with Cape Breton, and the other islands in the Gulf of St.
Lawrence, were ceded to Great Britain. In the West Indies, the
islands of Tobago, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Grenada were retained
by Great Britain; but Martinique, Guadaloupe, Marigalante, and
St. Lucia were restored to France. In the East Indies, the French
obtained the restitution of their settlements, but agreed not to
erect any fortifications in Bengal. Minorca was restored to England
in exchange for Belle-Isle, which had been captured by the British
in 1761, and it was stipulated that the fortifications of Dunkirk
should be demolished. Spain ceded East and West Florida to Great
Britain, in return for the restitution of the Havannah, Manilla,
and all the places which Spain had lost since the commencement of
the war.

[Sidenote: 1765]

In this year the THIRTY-FIRST regiment was embarked for Pensacola,
the capital of West Florida, which country had been ceded to Great
Britain by Spain at the peace of Fontainebleau; on the passage out,
the transport having the regiment on board put into Blue-field
Bay, Jamaica, at the time the yellow fever was raging with great
violence in that island; the THIRTY-FIRST took the infection, and
unfortunately carried it to Pensacola, where the soldiers continued
to suffer most severely; so great was the mortality, and so rapid
the disease in its course, that the regiment could not supply
men to carry their comrades to the grave. The men who attended
the funerals of their brother soldiers in the morning, while the
regiment was strong enough to preserve some ceremony, were, in
many instances, consigned to the tomb in the evening. It appears
by the newspapers of the period, in which allusion is made to the
mortality, that at one period of its illness the regiment could
muster only a corporal and six men for duty.

[Sidenote: 1772]

The regiment remained in the Floridas, garrisoning alternately St.
Augustine and Pensacola, the capitals of East and West Florida,
until the autumn of 1772, when it was embarked for _St. Vincent_,
to take part in reducing to submission the refractory Caribs in
that island.

The island of St. Vincent was captured from the French, in 1762,
and was ceded to Great Britain at the peace concluded in the
following year; it contained two tribes of natives, called the
_red_ and _black_ Caribs, the former being the aborigines, and the
latter having sprung from a cargo of African slaves, who escaped
from a vessel which was wrecked on the island. The Caribs were
devoted to the French interest; they were dangerous and troublesome
neighbours to the English planters, and it was found necessary to
restrain their conduct, and enforce obedience to a few salutary
regulations. They were, however, of a resolute spirit, possessed
many thickly wooded fastnesses, and resisted all attempts to
restrain their roving propensities and mode of life with such
determination, that it became necessary to augment the military
force on the island. Although they were contemptible opponents in
skill, yet the nature of the climate, and the natural difficulties
of the country, being thickly wooded where they inhabited, rendered
the service extremely tedious and arduous.

[Sidenote: 1773]

On the 14th of January, 1773, the THIRTY-FIRST regiment fell into
an ambuscade, and sustained some loss; the commanding officer,
Lieutenant-Colonel Ralph Walsh, was among the killed.

[Sidenote: 1774]

After the troops had been in the woods for some months, they at
length succeeded, in February, 1774, in bringing the Caribs to
terms, who agreed to acknowledge the sovereignty of Great Britain,
but were permitted to preserve their own laws and customs.

Thus terminated the Carib war. The THIRTY-FIRST regiment returned
to England, and was subsequently stationed in North Britain.

[Sidenote: 1775]

At this period the unfortunate misunderstanding between Great
Britain and her American colonies, on the subject of taxation,
produced open hostilities. On the 19th of April the first collision
occurred at _Lexington_, and on the 17th of June following the
battle of _Bunker’s Hill_ was fought. During the winter _Quebec_
was besieged by an American Army: this fortress was gallantly
defended by the troops under Lieut.-General Guy Carleton, and
reinforcements were ordered to proceed from England to Canada.

[Sidenote: 1776]

The THIRTY-FIRST regiment proceeded from Glasgow to Cork, whence
it embarked for Canada in April, as part of the army under
Major-General Burgoyne. The transports arrived at Quebec on the
28th of May, shortly after the defeat of the Americans by a sortie
of the garrison. Lieut.-General Carleton had pursued the enemy up
the river St. Lawrence, and Major-General Burgoyne’s force remained
only one night at anchor below Quebec, where orders had been left
for him to follow. He joined at _Trois Rivières_; part of the army
disembarked and immediately occupied the villages adjacent to their
post on the road to Montreal. On the 8th of June the Americans
attempted to surprise the post of Trois Rivières, having passed the
river from Sorel with two thousand men.

Brigadier-General Fraser, who commanded at the post of _Trois
Rivières_, gave the foe a ready reception, with such men as he
could collect, and, being soon supported from the cantonments and
the transports, put the Americans to the rout. The troops pursued
the fugitives along the shore, while the shipping sailed up the
river and intercepted their flight. Major-General Thompson, the
American General, with many officers, and two hundred men, were
taken prisoners.

On the 14th of June the flotillas and the force on shore reached
Sorel, which the colonists had evacuated a few hours before;
Major-General Burgoyne continued the pursuit as far as St. John’s,
where the troops from the transports under Major-General Phillips
joined him, and soon afterwards an additional reinforcement under
Brigadier-General Fraser.

All hope of accommodation now failed; on the 4th of July the
American Congress issued their Declaration of Independence,
and abjured their allegiance to the Crown of Great Britain. By
this Declaration the name of _colonies_ was abolished, and the
_thirteen_ provinces, namely, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia,
were constituted the _United States_ of America.

The whole of Major-General Burgoyne’s army was assembled by the end
of July at St. John’s, where it remained encamped during the naval
operations on Lake Champlain. After the defeat of the American
fleet, on the 11th of October, the weather becoming too severe for
further operations in the field, the troops returned to Canada. The
posts occupied by the THIRTY-FIRST regiment during the winter were
Sorel, St. Charles, St. Denis, St. Anthony, and St. Ours.

[Sidenote: 1777]

Major-General Burgoyne, who had proceeded to England to submit
to the Government a plan for the ensuing campaign, arrived in
Canada in May, 1777, empowered to carry it out. An army, composed
of British, Dutch, and Colonial Corps, with the _flank_ companies
of the regiments left to garrison Quebec (among which was the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment), amounting to nearly eight thousand men, was
equipped and in the field by the 1st of July.

The flank companies of the THIRTY-FIRST, commanded by Captains
Cotton and Simpson, formed, with the other flank companies
and the twenty-fourth regiment, the advance of the army under
Brigadier-General Fraser. _Ticonderago_ was first attacked, and the
Provincials were forced to evacuate that post.

Major-General Burgoyne’s plan was to penetrate the United States
from Lake Champlain to the river Hudson, and advance upon Albany,
with the view of reducing that country to submission. While
Major-General Burgoyne moved towards the lake by _Skenesborough_,
a short distance inland from South Bay, where an action occurred
on the 6th of July, Brigadier-General Fraser, with the advance,
followed the Provincial troops towards _Castleton_, and on the
following day commenced an action by detaching his light companies
to occupy a height commanding their flank. The American General
observing this movement detached a force to prevent the British
obtaining possession of this post. A sharp action ensued, and the
Americans retreated with much loss to Huberton, where, meeting with
a reinforcement, they made a stand in good order. Brigadier-General
Fraser attacked them with great vigour, but not having half
their number, made no impression upon them, until Major-General
Reidesel, commanding the Dutch, arrived, when their flank being
turned, the Americans retreated, leaving two hundred dead on the
field, among whom was Colonel Francis, their commander.

The flank companies were hotly engaged in this affair.
Brigadier-General Fraser had but 850 men in the beginning of the
day, while the enemy amounted to 2000.

When Major-General Burgoyne joined, he pursued the Americans to
Fort Anne and Fort Edward, notwithstanding the natural difficulties
of the road, which the enemy increased by every possible means
that could be devised. The Americans retreated from Fort Edward to
Saratoga, and abandoning Fort George, left the navigation of Lake
George open to Major-General Burgoyne.

General Arnold was now appointed to command the Americans in the
British front, and, forming at Saratoga, fell back to _Stillwater_.
Major-General Burgoyne remained at Fort Edward in great want of
provisions and of means to advance; a detachment sent to procure
supplies was completely cut off at Bennington, while Lieut.-Colonel
St. Leger was compelled to raise the siege of Fort Stanwix, leaving
behind his equipage and baggage.

The Americans, greatly elated by these circumstances, had assembled
a large body under Major-General Gates at _Stillwater_. Small
parties having been detached to Lieut.-General Burgoyne’s[20] rear,
were in some measure successful, and his communication being thus
threatened, notwithstanding his difficulties, arising from want of
resources, he resolved to advance, and at all hazards to attempt a
junction with the troops under Lieut.-General Sir Henry Clinton,
taking with him thirty days’ provisions. Lieut.-General Burgoyne
crossed the river Hudson on the 13th and 14th of September by a
bridge of rafts, which had once been swept away, and on the 18th
arrived at _Stillwater_, before the enemy’s position, which he
attacked at two o’clock in the afternoon of the 19th of September,
when a severe and indecisive action ensued. Both parties held their
respective positions, and entrenched themselves within them. The
British General, confined between two rivers by a stronger force
than his own, continued within his lines and redoubts until the 7th
of October, and when nearly destitute of provisions, determined to
make another effort to extricate his troops; 1500 British, with
twelve pieces of artillery, commanded by Lieut.-General Burgoyne in
person, moved in advance towards the American position, and formed
his right wing, while a body of light companies and Indians were
placed under cover to act upon the enemy’s rear when he should be
sufficiently advanced. General Gates, observing this separation of
wings, instantly attacked the left wing with a view to cut off all
chance of a junction; the British grenadiers were in this wing, and
behaved with great gallantry. General Arnold attacked the British
right, and Brigadier-General Fraser threw the light companies into
a second line, in rear of the right wing, to cover its retreat
upon the left. While this movement was taking place, the left of
the right wing doubled to the rear. Brigadier-General Fraser led
the light infantry to its support, but was mortally wounded; not,
however, before his brave troops gave the right wing time to
recover, and secured Lieut.-General Burgoyne’s retreat to his camp.
The Americans pushed on, and obtained an entrance into the British
lines: night put an end to the action.

During the night Lieut.-General Burgoyne removed his position to
higher ground in his rear. General Gates distributed his corps
to surround the British, and Lieut.-General Burgoyne once more
tried a new position, retiring on _Saratoga_, and abandoning his
baggage and provisions, as well as his hospital with 300 sick. He
reached Saratoga safely, the Americans having been delayed in their
pursuit by bad weather: a detachment, sent to observe the British,
succeeded in reaching the place, but withdrew on the appearance
of Lieut.-General Burgoyne’s force. Sending a detachment with
workmen to examine and repair the roads, Lieut.-General Burgoyne
resolved to continue his retreat to Fort George. The detachment,
which was of regular troops, had scarcely marched, when the
Americans appeared in force; it was instantly recalled, and the
hope of rendering the roads passable for artillery was abandoned.
The British patrols reported that every avenue of escape was in
possession of the enemy; the men were worn down with fatigue and
hunger, having been for some time on a reduced allowance, and
but three days’ provisions remained. Under these circumstances
Lieut.-General Burgoyne was constrained to treat with Major-General
Gates, and obtaining honorable terms, capitulated on the 17th of
October. The troops, of which the _grenadier_ and _light companies_
of the THIRTY-FIRST formed part, laid down their arms on condition
of being sent to England; and they engaged not to serve again in
North America during the war.

The American government violated the conditions of the convention,
and detained the troops until the year 1781.

[Sidenote: 1778]

[Sidenote: 1779]

In 1778 the French monarch sent a numerous fleet under the
Count D’Estaing, having on board a large body of troops, to the
assistance of the Americans; in 1779 the court of Spain commenced
hostilities against Great Britain, and this example was followed by
the Dutch.

[Sidenote: 1780]

Major-General Thomas Clarke, from the Coldstream Guards, was
appointed, on the 3rd of May, 1780, to the Colonelcy of the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment, in succession to Lieut.-General Sir James
Adolphus Oughton, K.B., deceased.

[Sidenote: 1781]

The _battalion_ companies of the regiment had remained in Canada,
where they eventually were joined by the _flank_ companies. On
the 12th of March, 1781, the _light company_ was detached to
Lake Champlain, with a view of reconnoitring the neighbourhood,
and effecting the destruction of the military stores left at
Ticonderago by Lieut.-General Burgoyne. The object was partly
accomplished, and Captain Andrew Ross, who commanded the company,
gained great credit for the skill and conduct he displayed in
this difficult enterprise. The party consisted, in addition to
the _light company_ of the THIRTY-FIRST, of men selected from
the different Provincial corps, with a few Indians. It was in
the spring of the year, when the ice was breaking up, and the
operations were attended with difficulties and great privations.
The men suffered so severely from fatigue, that the Provincials and
Indians dropped off by degrees, and the party was reduced, on its
return, to the _light company_ only.

During July the THIRTY-FIRST regiment was encamped on the Plain of
Abraham, memorable as the scene of the British victory over the
French under the Marquis de Montcalm, on the 13th September, 1759,
by which Quebec was gained to England, and in which battle the
celebrated Major-General Wolfe lost his life.

[Sidenote: 1782]

In October, 1781, the British army under Lieut.-General the Earl
Cornwallis, after a gallant defence against the combined French and
American forces, was compelled to surrender to General Washington
at York-Town. The enormous expense of carrying on the war with
America, so distant from the seat of preparation and power, with
the other evils attending this memorable and ever-to-be regretted
contest, were so apparent, that the desire for peace became
general, and King George III. at length conceded the Independence
of the United States. The Preliminary Articles of Peace were signed
at Paris on the 30th of November, 1782, by the Commissioners of the
King of Great Britain and by those of the American Congress, and
the Treaty was concluded in the ensuing February.

While the THIRTY-FIRST was stationed in Canada, a letter, dated
the 31st of August, 1782, conveyed to the regiment His Majesty’s
pleasure that _County-titles_ should be given to the regiments of
infantry, and the THIRTY-FIRST was directed to assume the name of
the HUNTINGDONSHIRE regiment, in order that a connexion between the
corps and that county should be cultivated, which might be useful
in furthering the success of the recruiting service.

[Sidenote: 1783]

The preliminaries of the treaties between England, France, and
Spain, were signed at Versailles on the 20th of January, 1783. St.
Lucia was restored to France, also the settlements on the river
Senegal, and the city of Pondicherry in the East Indies. France
relinquished all her West India conquests, with the exception of
Tobago; Spain retained Minorca (which she had captured in the
previous year) and West Florida; East Florida was ceded in exchange
for the restitution of the Bahamas to Great Britain.

On the 2nd of September, 1783, were signed the Preliminary Articles
of Peace with Holland, the peace with that country having been
postponed in consequence of the Dutch claiming an indemnification
for the expenses of the war, and the restoration of Trincomalee, in
Ceylon, which had been captured from the Dutch by the English, in
January, 1782, and retaken by the French in August following. The
place was, however, restored to Holland.

[Sidenote: 1787]

After eleven years’ service in North America, the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment embarked, on the 4th of October, 1787, at Quebec, and on
the 7th of November landed at Portsmouth.

During the two following years the regiment remained in Great
Britain.

[Sidenote: 1789]

In the year 1789 was effected the French Revolution; the Bastile
was stormed by the Parisians on the 14th of July, and the Governor
put to death. The National Assembly passed several decrees
abolishing all the relies of the feudal system. On the 20th of
August a declaration of rights was agreed on to serve as the basis
of the French constitution. A national force was embodied, and
no vestige of the old government remained, except a King without
power, and a Court without splendour.

In the summer of 1789 two British vessels were seized by the
commander of a Spanish frigate at Nootka Sound, on the western
coast of North America, where a settlement had recently been
established for carrying on the fur-trade with the natives. The
settlement was taken possession of by Spain, and the British
crews were made prisoners. The Government, on receiving this
intelligence, called upon the Court of Madrid to make satisfaction
for these injuries, and great preparations were made for war by
both countries.

[Sidenote: 1790]

Accordingly in July, 1790, the THIRTY-FIRST regiment embarked at
Spithead on board the fleet to perform its _original_ service of
MARINES, in the event of a war with Spain, which appeared probable.
The negotiations were protracted to a considerable length of time,
but on the 28th of October a convention was entered into, by which
Spain agreed to make reparation for the injuries sustained, and to
restore Nootka.

[Sidenote: 1791]

In July, 1791, the THIRTY-FIRST regiment was sent hastily to
Birmingham, to aid in the suppression of very serious disturbances,
which broke out there in consequence of the celebration of the
anniversary of the French Revolution, on the 14th of July, 1791,
by a party of the “Friends of Freedom,” at a tavern. The populace
destroyed the house and chapel of Dr. Priestley, the eminent
philosopher, and burned many of the dwellings of those suspected to
be friendly to the French cause. The troops employed were praised
for their regularity and forbearance on this occasion.

When order had been restored in Birmingham, an outbreak among the
miners at Whitehaven called for the assistance of the military,
and the regiment was again employed in the delicate as well as
unpleasant duty of aiding the civil power in the suppression of
riot.

[Sidenote: 1792]

Major-General James Stuart was appointed from the half-pay of the
Ninetieth regiment to the Colonelcy of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment
on the 8th of February, 1792, in succession to Lieutenant-General
Thomas Clarke, removed to the Thirtieth regiment.

On the 17th of April, 1792, the THIRTY-FIRST regiment embarked at
Port Patrick for Ireland.

[Sidenote: 1793]

Colonel Henry Lord Mulgrave, from the Grenadier Guards, was
appointed Colonel of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment on the 8th of
February, 1793, in succession to Major-General James Stuart,
deceased. His Lordship subsequently assumed the command of the
regiment at Waterford, as its Colonel; and, after inspecting the
corps in the field, entertained the officers at dinner.

Meanwhile, Louis XVI. had been decapitated, and the progress of
democracy menaced Europe with universal anarchy. On the 1st of
February the National Convention of France declared war against
Great Britain and Holland, and the British Government prepared
for hostilities. A large army was sent, under the command of the
Duke of York, to join the Austrian and Prussian allies. Several
engagements occurred, and the French gained possession of the
Austrian Netherlands. Holland opened her principal towns to the
enemy, and they were garrisoned by French troops.

In September, 1793, the _flank_ companies of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment embarked for Barbadoes, for the purpose of taking part in
the capture of the French West India Islands.

[Sidenote: 1794]

In the beginning of 1794 an armament was assembled at Barbadoes,
of which the _flank_ companies of the THIRTY-FIRST formed part,
and early in February the expedition, under Admiral Sir John
Jervis and General Sir Charles (afterwards Earl) Grey, sailed
for _Martinique_. After some sharp fighting the island was taken
possession of by General Sir Charles Grey, on the 22nd of March.[21]

From Martinique the _grenadiers_, under Prince Edward (afterwards
Duke of Kent), the _light_ infantry, under Major-General Dundas,
and three other regiments, embarked on the 30th of March for _St.
Lucia_, where they arrived on the 1st of April, and the conquest of
that island was effected in three days; His Royal Highness Prince
Edward, with his brigade of grenadiers, and Major-General Dundas,
with his brigade of light infantry, taking possession of St. Lucia
on the 4th of April. The flank companies of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment were afterwards employed in the reduction of the island of
_Guadaloupe_. A determined resistance was made by the enemy; but
the island was captured by the 20th of April.

France did not view with indifference the loss of these valuable
possessions, and in June a French armament arrived at _Guadaloupe_
for the recovery of that island. The light company, under
Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Andrew Ross, highly distinguished itself
on the night of the 13th of June, in attacking the enemy near
_Point-à-Petre_. General Sir Charles Grey stated in his despatch:--

  “Brevet Major Ross,[22] of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, who was
  with the light infantry, behaved with great gallantry and good
  conduct on this occasion, as he has done on every other.”

The light company also participated in a night attack on Fort
_Fleur d’Epée_ between the 25th and 26th of June; on the day
following, Brigadier-General Symes, with the grenadiers and light
infantry, attacked the enemy, who was driven to Morne Mascot, where
he again made resistance, but being charged with the bayonet, he
fled into Fort Fleur d’Epée.

Lieut.-Colonel Ross, of the THIRTY-FIRST, commanded the second
battalion of light infantry on these occasions.

Lieut.-Colonel Colin Graham, of the twenty-first Royal North
British Fusiliers, was appointed to the command of the troops
in Basse Terre, and he defended _Berville_ camp with the
utmost gallantry until the 6th of October, when he was forced
to surrender,--his force having become reduced by excessive
exertion, and the unhealthiness of the climate, to one hundred and
twenty-five rank and file fit for duty.

The troops at Guadaloupe suffered severely from the climate, and
the arduous duties they had to perform, and could only muster 389
soldiers fit for duty on the 1st of September.[23]

By the articles of capitulation the British troops were to march
out with the honors of war, and it was agreed to send the garrison
to England on board French ships, as soon as transports were
ready. The latter part of the agreement was not, however, complied
with, as they remained prisoners for more than a year afterwards,
during which time many of them died. The garrison consisted of
the flank companies of the 17th, 31st, and 34th regiments; the
39th, 43rd, 56th (three companies), and 65th regiments. Their loss
in the different actions between the 27th of September and the
6th of October amounted to two officers killed and five wounded;
twenty-five non-commissioned officers and privates killed, and
fifty-one wounded.

During the year 1794 Lieutenants Davies, Mackenzie, and Williams,
of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, died of fever contracted in the West
Indies.

The whole island of Guadaloupe, with the exception of Fort Matilda,
had been recaptured by the French: this fort was defended by the
troops under Lieut.-General Prescott until the 10th of December,
when it was evacuated by the British.

On the 12th of July, 1794, the THIRTY-FIRST regiment embarked at
Wexford for England, disembarked at Bristol, and marched thence to
Southampton.

The regiment, on the 25th of July, 1794, was augmented to ten
battalion and two flank companies; and on the 17th of August
following embarked for Holland, where it was stationed at
Middleburg and Flushing, in the island of Walcheren, but was not
employed on any particular duty.

[Sidenote: 1795]

In this year the regiment returned to England, and landed at
Plymouth on the 27th of February, 1795.

A camp was formed in the month of August, at Nursling, near
Southampton, which the THIRTY-FIRST regiment joined on the 25th
of that month, and received a reinforcement to its strength in
drafts from the 43rd, 88th, 92nd, and 94th regiments, which
raised its establishment to 1000 rank and file, with a second
lieutenant-colonel, a major, and one additional lieutenant to each
company, besides two recruiting companies.

On the 25th of October, 1795, the THIRTY-FIRST regiment embarked
for the West Indies, as part of the armament which had been
prepared for the deliverance of the French West India Islands
from the power of republicanism, and to reduce to obedience the
insurgents of St. Vincent and Grenada. The expedition, commanded
by Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby, sailed with the immense
fleet, under the convoy of a squadron of the Royal Navy, commanded
by Rear-Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. The troops amounted to about
25,000 men, in the highest state of equipment; and the armament
on quitting the British shores presented a magnificent spectacle,
calculated to impress the mind with a just idea of the power of
England; but it unfortunately happened that the voyage had been
delayed until a very late period of the year; three attempts were
made to get under weigh, and each was prevented by the violence of
the weather: many ships were driven from their anchors and stranded.

Three hundred sail got under weigh on the 11th of November, when an
accident to the Admiral rendered the attempt of no avail. On the
15th another endeavour was overcome by the tempestuous weather. At
length the fleet sailed, but it had scarcely got clear of the Isle
of Wight, when another severe storm obliged the vessels that had
ridden through it with safety to return to Portsmouth.

With great difficulty and exertion Admiral Christian collected the
remainder of his convoy, and again sailed on the 9th of December,
but four days afterwards a storm destroyed many of the transports,
and so scattered the fleet as to render a re-union impossible.

[Sidenote: 1796]

Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby sailed in the “Arethusa”
frigate, with such vessels as could be collected, and on the 14th
of March, 1796, arrived at Barbadoes.

The THIRTY-FIRST regiment, having weathered the storm, which had
dispersed the fleet in the Channel, proceeded on the voyage, but
was unable to make good the passage, and on the 5th of February,
1796, after being six weeks at sea struggling against the violent
tempests, the regiment was landed at Gosport, whence it marched to
Poole, in Dorsetshire; the regiment was not long inactive, as on
the 19th of March it was again on board ship at Southampton, and
proceeded to its original destination.

On the 1st of May the THIRTY-FIRST arrived off the island of _St.
Lucia_, on which Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby had already
effected a landing. The regiment disembarked immediately, under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel Hay, and was cantoned near the point of
disembarkation at Choc Bay. The fortress of _Morne Fortunée_ was
invested by Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby; _Morne Chabot_,
another strong position, having been carried with great gallantry
by Brigadier-General (afterwards Sir John) Moore.

The batteries against _Morne Fortunée_ were opened on the 14th of
May, and on the night of the 17th the strong outpost of _La Vigie_
was assaulted. The THIRTY-FIRST regiment marched from its position,
near Choc Bay, at sunset, for the purpose of a night-attack upon
this post, which was remarkably strong. It formed a peninsula,
accessible only by a narrow isthmus, and commanded the entrance
on one side of the Carenage harbour. The post was defended by
two batteries; the first placed midway upon the acclivity, and
the second on the summit of the height. The approaches to both
were by a circuitous path, and the guide who accompanied the
regiment was mortally wounded by the first fire from the enemy’s
piquet stationed on the isthmus. The regiment, being ignorant
of the country, missed the proper direction. Lieut.-Colonel Hay
ordered it to ascend the hill _en force_, which was done, although
attended with great difficulty from the precipitous nature of the
ground. The first battery was gallantly carried by storm, and the
enemy retired to the higher one. The regiment was unfortunately
separated in the ascent, and was unable to make a concentrated and
effectual attack upon the works that crowned the height, which it
nevertheless, in spite of all obstacles, bravely attempted, but the
enemy’s grape-shot took such effect that the regiment was obliged
to withdraw, after a severe struggle.

The THIRTY-FIRST had Captains Johnson and Walker, four serjeants,
and eighty rank and file _killed_; Lieut.-Colonels Hay and
Arbuthnot, Captains Murray and Sorrell, Lieutenants Sullivan and
Hawkshaw, four serjeants, and one hundred and twenty-one rank and
file _wounded_.

On the 25th of May the island of St. Lucia capitulated, and
the THIRTY-FIRST, forty-fourth, forty-eighth, and fifty-fifth
regiments, under Brigadier-General Moore, were selected to occupy
the place. The possession of the island was not a quiet one; small
bodies of French, who had deserted from the different fortresses
at their capitulation, withdrew into the interior, and joined the
runaway slaves and Caribs; taking advantage of the impenetrable
nature of the country, they formed themselves into bands for the
purpose of molesting the British, and plundering the planters and
other residents of the island. Brigadier-General Moore took the
field, and penetrated with his force into the wildest quarters of
the mountains, in order to eradicate these predatory bands.

The THIRTY-FIRST was employed on this harassing duty, and suffered
much from fatigue, privation, and continual exposure; on the
service being concluded, the regiment went into quarters at _Vieux
Fort_, and other posts, when it became so unhealthy that the
authorities were compelled to remove the corps from the island.
The deaths among the men were for a time sixteen each day; on
the embarkation of the regiment, on the 22nd of December, for
Barbadoes, it had scarcely a soldier fit for duty; and on its
disembarkation there, six days afterwards, it became necessary to
send the entire regiment into hospital, which was the _second_ time
the THIRTY-FIRST had been rendered unserviceable from sickness,
the corps having suffered in a similar manner while stationed in
Florida in the year 1765.

During the year 1796 the regiment had lost seventeen officers, and
eight hundred and seventy men, including those who fell in the
attack of _La Vigie_, in St. Lucia.

In the previous year Prussia had concluded a peace with the French
republic, and, in consequence of the United Provinces of Holland
having leagued with France, England had taken possession of the
Cape of Good Hope; in February, 1796, the island of Ceylon was
also captured from the Dutch by Great Britain. The former allies
of England now became converted into enemies. War was declared
by Holland, which had been constituted the Batavian republic,
against Great Britain in May, and Spain followed the example in
October. In the same month Lord Malmesbury was sent to Paris to
negotiate a peace on the part of the British Government, but the
French insisted upon retaining, as integral parts of the republic,
the conquests lately made: these terms could not be acceded
to consistently with the general interests of Europe, and the
negotiation was discontinued.

[Sidenote: 1797]

On the 14th of February, 1797, the combined fleets of France and
Spain were defeated off Cape St. Vincent, by Admiral Sir John
Jervis, afterwards created Earl St. Vincent, on account of this
glorious victory, for which the honor of knighthood was also
conferred on Commodore (afterwards Admiral Viscount) Nelson. On the
18th of February the Spanish island of Trinidad surrendered to a
British force under Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby.

In April, 1797, Austria signed the preliminaries of peace with the
French Republic, and, in July, Lord Malmesbury was sent a second
time to negotiate a treaty, but the demands of the French Directory
rendered the attempt abortive.

In the year 1797 the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, greatly reduced in
numbers, embarked for England and landed at Gravesend in July; it
mustered only _eighty-five_ men, including serjeants, drummers, and
rank and file. Shortly after disembarkation the regiment marched to
Doncaster, and remained at stations between that place, Hull, and
York, for the two following years.

In this year alarming mutinies occurred on board the fleet at
Spithead and the Nore, but the British seamen nobly redeemed their
character on the 11th of October, 1797, in the victory gained by
Admiral Duncan (who was in consequence created Viscount Duncan),
over the Dutch fleet, off Camperdown, which was proceeding to join
that of the French at Brest.

On the 17th of October the definitive treaty of peace between
Austria and the French republic was signed at Campo Formio, so that
Great Britain was left to continue the contest single-handed with
France and her allies.

[Sidenote: 1798]

The threat of invasion, renewed by France, called forth the
patriotic feelings of the British nation; the militia force was
increased, and volunteer corps were formed in every part of the
kingdom.

Napoleon Bonaparte, against whose legions in the Peninsula,
in subsequent years, the THIRTY-FIRST regiment acquired great
renown, was now rising step by step to that Imperial sway which he
afterwards attained. The French Directory, jealous of his ambition,
sent him on the expedition to Egypt, with the view of acting from
that country against the British empire in India. Napoleon took
Alexandria by storm, and soon established himself at Cairo. The
Sublime Porte, incensed by the invasion of Egypt, declared war
against France, and formed an alliance with Russia. The fleet,
which had conveyed the expedition to Egypt, was almost destroyed
by Admiral Nelson in _Aboukir Bay_ on the 1st of August. So large
a portion of the French army being thus secluded in a distant
land, gave fresh impulse to the Allies, and in November the island
of _Minorca_ surrendered to the British arms. In December the
co-operation of Russia against France was secured by Great Britain.

[Sidenote: 1799]

At this period of the war the soldiers of the English militia
regiments were permitted to extend their services to the regular
army;--the THIRTY-FIRST regiment received eight hundred and
fifty-three volunteers from the militia.

In March, 1799, war was declared by the French Directory against
Austria, and the combined Austrian and Russian armies were so
successful as to recover the greater portion of Italy.

In August, 1799, a corresponding attempt was made by Great Britain
to recover Holland from the dominion of France, and a numerous army
was selected to proceed to that country, under His Royal Highness
the Duke of York. Previously to the arrival of the Duke of York,
the army was commanded by Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby,
K.B., with the local rank of General.

The THIRTY-FIRST regiment marched to Deal, embarked for Holland
on the 8th of September, and arrived at the Helder on the 15th of
the same month. The THIRTY-FIRST and other regiments were embarked
after the departure of General Sir Ralph Abercromby, in order
to reinforce his army. The Duke of York, having preceded these
additional troops by two days, was already in command of the army,
which was intrenched in the advance of the Helder on the Zuype, in
which lines Sir Ralph Abercromby had, on the 10th of September,
near the village of _Crabbendam_, repulsed the attack of the French
and Dutch under General Brune.

Immediately on landing, the THIRTY-FIRST marched to the lines, and
joined Major-General the Earl of Chatham’s brigade, in the division
of General Sir Ralph Abercromby, on the 15th of September. The
Duke of York, having been reinforced by the expected arrival of a
corps of twelve thousand Russians, under Lieut.-General Hermann,
resolved on attacking the French position in advance of _Alkmaar_,
reaching from Zuyder-Zee on the right, to Camperdown on the left,
and embracing the town of Bergen.

The attack was made on the 19th of September, in four columns: the
right, formed entirely of Russians, under Lieut.-General Hermann,
moved on Bergen; the centre divisions, under Lieut.-General Dundas
and Lieut.-General Sir James Pulteney, forced the village and post
of Oude Carspel, on the road to Alkmaar; while the left column,
in which was the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, under General Sir Ralph
Abercromby, advanced to the capture of Hoorne.

The point of attack selected for Sir Ralph Abercromby’s division
being at a considerable distance beyond the extent of the line,
the THIRTY-FIRST, and other regiments, marched at eight o’clock on
the night of the 18th of September, and the movement was performed
with such skill and secrecy, that Hoorne was surprised and carried
on the following morning without loss, which placed the French
position in considerable peril. The Russians having failed in
holding Bergen, after having entered it in gallant style, rendered
it impossible for the centre division to continue in possession
of the posts it had acquired. The British troops were therefore
withdrawn to their former lines upon the Zuype, to which the
Russians had retreated. Hoorne was evacuated, and the THIRTY-FIRST,
with the other regiments of Sir Ralph Abercromby’s division,
returned on the night of the 19th of September to the ground they
had quitted on the former evening.

From the 20th of September until the 1st of October, both armies
remained within their intrenchments, strengthening their lines of
defence; the French had received reinforcements, and had inundated
a large tract of country on their right by cutting the sluices,
thus contracting the ground of operations to six or seven miles.

The Duke of York, on the 2nd of October, made another attack on the
French position between _Bergen_ and _Egmont-op-Zee_. The combined
attacks were made in four columns; the division under General Sir
Ralph Abercromby, being on the right, marched along the beach. The
left of the French army was posted and concentrated about Bergen, a
large village surrounded by extensive woods, through which passed
the great road leading to Haarlem; between which and the sea was
an extensive region of high sand-hills impassable for artillery.
Behind the sand-hills, and to the enemy’s right, through the whole
extent of North Holland, lies a wet and low country, intersected
with dykes, canals, and ditches. The French centre was supported
by the town of Alkmaar. The battle soon became serious in front
of _Bergen_, upon which Lieut.-General Dundas had been ordered to
proceed.

Meanwhile Sir Ralph Abercromby had passed Bergen in order to
turn the position of the French at _Alkmaar_, and overcame every
opposition until he reached _Egmont-op-Zee_, which post was
occupied in great numbers, and gallantly defended. Sir Ralph
Abercromby, however, here overthrew a corps of the French army, and
wheeling his division to the left, turned the enemy’s position at
_Bergen_, upon which General Brune, the commander-in-chief of the
French and Batavian army, fell back, taking up an equally strong
position at a short distance to the rear.

The THIRTY-FIRST regiment had an opportunity of distinguishing
itself particularly throughout this arduous contest, which lasted
from six in the morning until the same hour in the evening. In
the attack of Bergen, the regiment took two pieces of artillery
from the enemy; the corps on the right frequently charged with the
bayonet, and lost a great number of men. The THIRTY-FIRST regiment
had one serjeant and twenty-seven rank and file _killed_; Captain
Smith, Ensign King, and fifty-five rank and file _wounded_.

During the night of the 2nd of October, Bergen and Egmont-op-Zee
were evacuated by the enemy.

The army remained during the night on the ground it held at the
close of the battle, and on the 3rd of October _Alkmaar_ was
occupied by detachments of British troops. On the 6th of October,
the advanced posts in front of Alkmaar, Egmont-op-Hooff, and
Egmont-op-Zee, were pushed forward, preparatory to a general
forward movement. At first little opposition was shown, and the
British took possession of some villages, and of a position on the
sand-hills near Wyck-op-Zee; but the column of Russian troops,
under the command of Major-General D’Essen, in endeavouring to gain
a height in front of their intended advanced post at Baccum, was
vigorously opposed, and afterwards attacked by a strong body of the
enemy.

This movement obliged General Sir Ralph Abercromby to move up in
support with the reserve of his corps; the French advanced their
whole force; the action became general along the whole line from
Limmen to the sea, and was maintained with great obstinacy on both
sides until night, when the enemy retired, leaving the British
masters of the field of battle. The THIRTY-FIRST regiment, on
the 6th of October, had Lieutenant Forster, one serjeant, and
thirty-five rank and file _killed_; Captain Pickering, Lieutenants
Mullins, Walker, Ball, Ensigns Williams and Johnson, three
serjeants, and eighty-four rank and file _wounded_.

In the meantime the French army had been reinforced; the state of
the weather, the ruined condition of the roads, the total want of
the necessary supplies, offered great obstacles; besides which, the
efforts which had been made for the liberation of Holland were not
seconded by the Dutch people, so that it was determined to withdraw
the British army. A convention was ultimately concluded with
General Brune at Alkmaar, on the 18th of October.

On the 16th of November the THIRTY-FIRST regiment embarked at the
Texel, and landed at Deal three days afterwards, when it marched
immediately to Canterbury, where the effects of the Dutch campaign
began to be perceptible. Before the army left Holland dysentery
had broken out among the men, arising from their exposure to the
damp and fogs natural to the country. The THIRTY-FIRST lost a great
number of men, from this cause, while stationed at Canterbury.

[Sidenote: 1800]

On the 15th of May, 1800, the THIRTY-FIRST regiment embarked at
Dover for Ireland, landed at Cove on the 6th of June, and marched
directly to Cork, where a force was collecting for a secret
service, to which it was added. On the 27th of June the embarkation
took place, and on the 8th of July the armament reached the Bay
of Quiberon; the twenty-third, THIRTY-FIRST, fifty-second, and
sixty-third regiments landed on the Isle de Houat, where they
remained encamped, under the command of Brigadier-General the
Honorable Thomas Maitland, until the 19th of August, when they
again embarked and joined the expedition under Lieut.-General Sir
James Pulteney, destined for the coast of Spain. A landing was
effected at _Ferrol_ on the 25th of August; the troops advanced to
the heights which overlook the town, and the THIRTY-FIRST had some
skirmishing with the enemy’s piquets. After viewing the town and
its defences, Sir James Pulteney abandoned the idea of attacking
the place; the troops were re-embarked on the following morning,
and the fleet sailed for Vigo, where it arrived on the 27th of
August. Here General Sir Ralph Abercromby joined with other troops,
and assumed the command of the whole force. After remaining in Vigo
Bay for some time, the fleet sailed for Cadiz, where it arrived on
the 3rd of October. Sir Ralph Abercromby summoned the Governor to
surrender, but an epidemic fever was raging in the city, and the
fleet quitted the coast for fear of infection, and proceeded to
Gibraltar.

At this period General Sir Ralph Abercromby received orders
from the British Government to proceed to Egypt; but the three
battalions of the ninth foot, the second battalion of the
twenty-seventh, the THIRTY-FIRST, and two battalions of the
fifty-second regiment, being composed principally of volunteers
from the militia, whose conditions of enlistment limited their
services to time and place, were not available for the expedition
to Egypt: they were accordingly ordered to proceed to Lisbon, where
they arrived on the 27th of November, having suffered much from
confinement on board ship, and the use of salt provisions.

[Sidenote: 1801]

On the 27th of January, 1801, the THIRTY-FIRST was again at sea,
and on the 14th of February disembarked at Minorca, which had
surrendered to Great Britain in November, 1798; this island was
restored to Spain at the Peace of 1802.

[Sidenote: 1802]

The successes of the British arms in Egypt, by which the French
were expelled from that country, were followed by a Treaty of
Peace, which was signed on the 27th of March, 1802, at Amiens,
between the French Republic, Spain, and the Batavian Republic,
on the one part, and Great Britain on the other. The principal
features of the treaty were, that Great Britain restored all her
conquests during the war, excepting Trinidad and Ceylon, which were
ceded to her, the former by Spain, and the latter by the Batavian
Republic. Portugal was maintained in its integrity, excepting
that some of its possessions in Guiana were ceded to France. The
territories of the Ottoman Porte were likewise maintained in their
integrity. The Ionian Republic was recognised, and Malta was to be
restored to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. The French agreed
to evacuate the Neapolitan and Roman states, and Great Britain all
the ports that she held in the Adriatic and the Mediterranean.

In May, 1802, the THIRTY-FIRST regiment sailed from Minorca for
England, and early in June landed at Portsmouth, on the 19th of
which month it was reduced to the Peace Establishment.

[Sidenote: 1803]

In the year 1803 the regiment was removed to Jersey.[24]

Napoleon Bonaparte was now approaching the zenith of his power:
the unsettled state of affairs in France had induced him to quit
his army in Egypt, and on his return the Directory was abolished,
Bonaparte being appointed First Consul of the French Republic. This
occurred in 1799, and in the following year Europe was astounded by
his daring passage of the Alps, followed by the victory of Marengo,
which caused Austria to sue for peace.

The French being driven from Egypt in 1801 by the gallant
Abercromby and his brave troops, in which the THIRTY-FIRST regiment
would probably have shared, had it not been for the circumstances
stated at page 61, the Peace of Amiens was concluded; it,
however, gave but a slight interval of tranquillity to Europe.
The military spirit of the French nation had been aroused by the
genius of Napoleon, who endeavoured to realize his schemes for the
aggrandizement of France;--and England appeared as a barrier to his
designs.

In May, 1803, the war was renewed; Hanover was overrun by the
French, and severed for a time from the British Crown. An immense
flotilla was also assembled at Boulogne for the invasion of
England. The threat of invasion aroused the patriotism of the
British people, and the most strenuous measures were pursued to
defeat the French ruler’s designs; the “_Army of Reserve Act_” was
passed in June, 1803, for raising men for home service by ballot;
numerous volunteer and yeomanry corps were formed in every part of
the kingdom; and all party differences merged into one universal
effort for the preservation of Great Britain.

[Sidenote: 1804]

On the 18th of May, 1804, Napoleon was invested with the dignity of
_Emperor of the French_, and on the 26th of May of the following
year he was crowned _King of Italy_ at Milan.

Further measures of defence were adopted by Great Britain, and the
“_Additional Force Act_” was passed on the 14th of July, 1804, by
which a _second battalion_ was added to the THIRTY-FIRST regiment,
to be formed of men raised in the county of Chester, for limited
service.

The regiment embarked at Jersey for England on the 9th of November,
and on the 27th of that month arrived at Portsmouth, whence it
marched to Winchester, and received a further number of volunteers
from the Militia.

On the 12th of December the Court of Spain issued a declaration
of war against England, in consequence of the capture of some
frigates off Cadiz, which had been intercepted while on their way
to France with cargoes of treasure,--Spain having agreed to furnish
a powerful aid to Napoleon.

[Sidenote: 1805]

By July, 1805, the second battalion was fully embodied, and in
October proceeded from Chester to Winchester, where the first
battalion was stationed.

While the French were pursuing their victorious career in Germany,
they experienced dreadful reverses from the navy of Great Britain.
On the 21st of October the combined fleets of France and Spain were
completely defeated off Cape _Trafalgar_. The victory was, however,
clouded by the death of Admiral Viscount Nelson, to whose memory
the highest honors were paid by a grateful and admiring nation.

[Sidenote: 1806]

On the 9th of January, 1806, the THIRTY-FIRST regiment was present
at the funeral of Admiral Viscount Nelson, and formed part of the
line between which the procession passed on its way to St. Paul’s
Cathedral, in which the Admiral’s remains were interred, and where
a monument was erected by order of Parliament.

In November of the preceding year a squadron of English and Russian
vessels landed some troops at Naples without any opposition from
the Neapolitan Court. The French Emperor, on receiving intelligence
of this transaction, issued a proclamation that “_the Neapolitan
dynasty had ceased to reign_,” and an army, under his brother,
Joseph Bonaparte, assisted by Marshal Massena, marched for Naples.
On the 15th of February the French entered that capital, and
soon obtained possession of the whole kingdom, excepting Gaeta;
Ferdinand IV. and his Court having previously retired to Sicily.
A decree was shortly issued by Napoleon, conferring the crown of
Naples on his brother Joseph, who was proclaimed King on the 30th
of May.

England being desirous of preserving Sicily from the dominion of
France, troops were embarked for that island;--on the 26th of
April the _first battalion_ of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment embarked
at Tilbury-fort, and landed at Messina on the 26th of July.

Previously to the arrival of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, the French
had assembled a force in Calabria for the invasion of Sicily,
and Major-General Stuart, commanding the British troops in that
island, formed the design of cutting off the French division under
General Regnier; the result was the battle of _Maida_, where a
victory was gained by the British troops on the 4th of July.
Major-General Stuart being sensible that he could not, with his
small force, maintain himself in Calabria, recrossed the straits of
Messina and returned to Sicily. For this victory Major-General John
Stuart received the dignity of Knight of the Bath, the thanks of
Parliament, and was created Count of Maida by the King of the Two
Sicilies.

[Sidenote: 1807]

Admiral Sir John Duckworth having failed in his coercive
mission to detach Turkey from the interests of France, Great
Britain determined to seize upon Egypt, as a check to any fresh
demonstration by the French against the British possessions in the
East Indies.

An armament accordingly sailed from Melazzo, on the coast of
Sicily, in February, 1807, under the command of Major-General
Alexander Mackenzie Fraser, Colonel of the seventy-eighth regiment,
and landed at Aboukir on the 18th of March. On the 21st of
March, Alexandria was occupied by the British troops, and it is
a singular coincidence that it was the anniversary of the battle
fought near there in the year 1801, when the gallant General Sir
Ralph Abercromby received the wound which terminated his honorable
career.

On the 27th of March a force of fifteen hundred men, of which the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment formed part, was detached under the command
of Major-General Wauchope to Rosetta. The troops arrived before the
city on the 31st of March, and not having been impeded in their
progress to the environs, entered the place. The THIRTY-FIRST
regiment marched into Rosetta, while the grenadier battalion
occupied a high sandy mound without the city.

Rosetta is situated upon a slight eminence, commanding a view of
the river Nile and the fertile lands of the Delta; the streets are
somewhat wider than the generality of Egyptian towns, and planted
here and there with trees. The houses are high, the lower half of
each being a dead wall, with a small door, leading into a narrow
passage, well secured with bolts and bars of iron. The chambers
are above, with trelliced windows projecting over the streets. The
Turks had garrisoned their houses, and remaining quiet, allowed the
British to continue their march until some way into the town, when
through the loop-holes they had constructed on purpose, and their
trelliced windows, a destructive and unexpected fire was opened
upon the column. The troops, although placed in a most trying
and perilous situation, behaved extremely well, and after having
suffered very materially in killed and wounded, retired to Aboukir,
from whence they returned to Alexandria.

Major-General Wauchope, who commanded the force, was killed; the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment had Captain John Robertson, three serjeants,
three drummers, and sixty-nine rank and file _killed_; Captain
Patrick Dowdall, Lieutenants Edward Knox, Peter Fearon, John
Thornton, ---- Sladden, and Francis Ryan, Ensign Richard Kirby,
seven serjeants, one drummer, and one hundred and twenty-nine rank
and file _wounded_. Lieutenant Sladden subsequently died of his
wounds.

Brigadier-General the Honorable Robert Meade (Lieutenant-Colonel of
the THIRTY-FIRST), the second in command, was also severely wounded.

Major-General Fraser finding that a famine would be the consequence
of the British remaining at Alexandria, without the occupation of
Rosetta, detached another body of troops, amounting to two thousand
five hundred men, under Brigadier-General the Honorable William
Stewart, to reduce the place. The force consisted of a detachment
of Royal Artillery, a detachment of the twentieth light dragoons,
light infantry battalion, first battalion of the thirty-fifth
regiment, second battalion of the seventy-eighth regiment, the
Baron De Roll’s regiment, and a detachment of seamen. A large
Turkish force coming down the Nile from Cairo, the troops were
compelled to retire, fighting all the way to Alexandria.

A formidable force now approached Alexandria, and Major-General
Fraser sent a flag of truce offering to evacuate Egypt, on
condition that the British prisoners should be liberated. The
proposal was readily accepted, and on the 19th of September the
British troops embarked for Sicily, where they arrived on the 16th
of October.

[Sidenote: 1808]

The first battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment embarked from
Sicily for Malta, on the 17th of September, 1808, where it remained
until August, 1810, when it returned to Sicily.

[Sidenote: 1810]

[Sidenote: 1811]

On the 17th of August, 1810, the first battalion landed at Messina,
and remained in garrison in the citadel until April, 1811, when
Lieut.-General Lord William Bentinck, being about to proceed to
the eastern coast of Spain, sent it to Malta, in order that a
stronger corps might be drawn from that island, the thirty-first
having been reduced considerably in numbers while stationed in
the Mediterranean. The battalion landed at Malta on the 18th of
April, but the force left in Sicily being found insufficient, four
companies were immediately recalled, and on the 22nd of April
re-embarked for Messina; a few months afterwards the head-quarters
were ordered back to Sicily, and on the 28th of August joined the
detached companies, when the battalion was once more united in
Sicily.

[Sidenote: 1812]

About this period the British authorities in Sicily detected the
traces of a conspiracy set on foot the year before by the Queen
of Naples, who, it is said, had proposed a scheme to Napoleon for
massacring the English. A new constitution was established in
Sicily, upon the model of that of Great Britain, under the auspices
of Lieut.-General Lord William Bentinck, who had been appointed
Captain-General of the Island, and the Queen was sent into
retirement.

In November, 1812, the grenadier company of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment embarked from Sicily for the east coast of Spain, under
Lieut.-General Frederick Maitland, and landed at Alicant on the
2nd of December. In April, 1813, it returned to Sicily, where it
arrived in May.

[Sidenote: 1813]

The first battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment remained in
garrison in the citadel of Messina until towards the end of 1813,
when, in consequence of disturbances at Palermo, the capital of
Sicily, which threatened to spread, the troops were detached to
various central positions. The THIRTY-FIRST, by a detour, marched
upon Castro Giovanni, and remained there until January, 1814, when
the battalion returned to Messina.

[Sidenote: 1814]

On the 28th of March, 1814, the battalion embarked at Melazzo,
as part of an expedition destined for the shores of Italy, under
Lieut.-General Lord William Bentinck. In the beginning of April the
first division of the army arrived off the coast above and below
the city of Genoa, and threatened a descent upon _Voltri_, rather
to engage the attention of the enemy, however, in that quarter,
than for any other purpose.

On the 5th of April the second division of the Anglo-Sicilian
army disembarked at Leghorn, and marched directly upon Sestri.
The French reinforced that place to protect the coast batteries,
and prevent the British communicating with the people of the
mountains, who were ready to rise against the French. The two
British divisions had united, and attacked the enemy, on the 8th
of April, at _Sestri_; the battle lasted throughout the day, and
in the night the French General Ronger St. Victor retired towards
Recco, taking up his position in rear of Rafallo, where he left
his advanced guard; a third British division, in which was the
first battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST, hovered about the coast, and
made some attempts to land fresh troops, but was prevented by the
enemy’s detachments at Recco.

On the 9th and 10th of April the squadron cannonaded _Recco_, but
was obliged to stand out again; in the night of the 10th General
Pègot, who had arrived to relieve General Ronger St. Victor,
retired, and occupied, on the 11th of April, a position at Mount
Fascia. The English squadron and transports had all arrived before
_Genoa_, and a detachment from the divisions on shore had been
able to communicate with the native levies at Fontana Buona. On
the 12th of April the position of Mount Fascia was attacked, and,
after a hard day’s contest, General Pègot fell back in the night,
and took up another strong position at _La Sturla_, on the heights
of Albaro, his right on the sea being covered by a battery of four
pieces of artillery, and his left resting on Fort Richelieu. The
remainder of the British army disembarked at Nervi, and immediately
attacked the enemy on the heights of Albaro, on the 13th of April.

The THIRTY-FIRST, under the command of Colonel Bruce, belonged
to this division, and, with the 8th battalion of the Line of the
King’s German Legion, dashed in among the enemy the instant of
their debarkation, notwithstanding the intersected and difficult
nature of the ground, which assisted so materially the obstinate
defence of the French. Meanwhile the light company of the
THIRTY-FIRST, under Captain Nunn, had carried the battery which
covered the enemy’s right, with conspicuous bravery, and dismounted
the four guns upon it under a galling fire of musketry and
artillery from another battery near that captured.

The THIRTY-FIRST had Captains Stewart and Cruice, three serjeants,
one drummer, and thirty-six rank and file _wounded_; one serjeant
and thirteen rank and file _killed_.

The following extract from Division Orders, dated La Sturla, 14th
of April, 1814, bears testimony to the conduct of the corps:--

  “The conduct of the troops in the long contested action of
  yesterday, at _La Sturla_, was most honorable to them, and
  Major-General Montresor feels the greatest satisfaction in doing
  justice to their merits, by publicly declaring his high sense
  of their persevering gallantry in surmounting the numberless
  obstacles which the broken and intersected nature of the country
  presented, in every step, to their advance, whilst it afforded
  the best shelter to the enemy, who, well accustomed to his
  ground, defended it with the greatest obstinacy.

  “However justly entitled the whole may be to individual
  distinction, it nevertheless would be unjust not to notice, in
  particular, the ardour and spirited skill in which the Royal
  Flotilla, and the detachments of the third Italian Levy, and of
  the second and third extra regiments, and Royal Marines, began
  the attack, and the very gallant manner in which the THIRTY-FIRST
  regiment, and the 8th King’s German Legion, dashed in amongst the
  enemy after their debarkation, and the conspicuous bravery of
  the light company of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, in carrying the
  battery on the left.”

During the 14th and 15th of April the attacks upon the heights of
Albaro were repeated, and on the 17th, while disaffection among the
people was rapidly spreading in Genoa, the posts of St. Francisco
and St. Martin d’Albaro were carried, and the French retired behind
the Bizagno.

By the 18th of April the disaffection in Genoa had reached a
crisis, and upon the following day the advance upon the city took
place. The THIRTY-FIRST drove the enemy from a strong battery of
ten brass guns and two 13½ inch brass mortars, without sustaining
any loss.

During the night of the 19th of April a convention was signed;
on the morning of the 21st, the enemy marched out of the city
and evacuated all his posts. On the 22nd the head-quarters
of the THIRTY-FIRST were within the city of Genoa, when the
Commander-in-Chief, Lieut.-General Lord William Bentinck, issued
the order from which the following extract is taken:--

      “Head-Quarters, Genoa, 24th April, 1814.

  “The Commander of the Forces has much satisfaction in witnessing
  the zeal and gallantry evinced by the whole of the troops
  under his orders in the late operations, which have led to the
  possession of this important fortress; and he has not failed
  to represent their conduct in the most favourable terms to His
  Majesty’s government.

  “Major-General Montresor has particularly reported to him the
  great assistance he received from Brigadier-General Roth, Colonel
  Bruce, and Lieut.-Colonel Travers.

  “The Commander of the Forces himself observed the very gallant
  and successful attack made by the third Italian regiment, under
  the orders of Lieut.-Colonel Ciravignac, and favourable reports
  have been made to him of the conduct of the light company of the
  twenty-first regiment, commanded by Captain Renny, the light
  company of the THIRTY-FIRST, under Captain Nunn, and the light
  company of the second Estero regiment, under Captain-Lieutenant
  Fulghier.”

On the 27th of April the first battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST
sailed with a force for the island of Corsica; when the troops
arrived opposite Ajaccio, that place capitulated. The THIRTY-FIRST
regiment then sailed for Bastia (the birth-place of Napoleon),
and landing there on the 11th of May, remained until the 24th of
June following, when it embarked for Sicily, and again went into
garrison in the citadel of Messina, on the 18th of July, 1814.

In the meantime the brilliant successes gained over the French in
the Peninsula and South of France, by the troops under the Duke of
Wellington, in which the _second_ battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment bore a prominent part, led to a treaty of peace with
France; Napoleon retired to Elba, which island was ceded to him in
full sovereignty for life, with a pension payable from the revenues
of France; and on the 3rd of May, 1814, Louis XVIII. entered Paris,
and ascended the throne of his ancestors.

On the 24th of October, 1814, the _second_ battalion of the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment was disbanded at Portsmouth, and the officers
and men fit for service were transferred to the first battalion,
with which they were incorporated on the 6th of May, 1815, at
Messina.

In commemoration of the services of the _second_ battalion during
the Peninsular War, the THIRTY-FIRST regiment has received the
Royal Authority to bear on the Regimental Colour and Appointments,
the words “TALAVERA,” “ALBUHERA,” “VITTORIA,” “PYRENEES,”
“NIVELLE,” “NIVE,” “ORTHES,” and “PENINSULA.”

[Sidenote: 1815]

Although the first and second battalions of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment were employed in different countries, yet they were
engaged in the promotion of the same interests, namely, the
restoration of the exiled families of the House of Bourbon to the
thrones of their ancestors; the achievements of the _second_
battalion were in the most distinguished arena, but the _first_
battalion, although it was stationed among the pastoral beauties of
Sicily, and the luxurious towns of Italy, maintained its discipline
and character, besides adding honors to those formerly acquired on
the field of battle, whenever, as on the heights of _Albaro_, an
opportunity had offered.

The peace of Europe was again to be disturbed. The French army
retained a chivalrous veneration for Napoleon, who returned from
Elba, landed at Cannes, in Provence, on the 1st of March, 1815, and
was joined by his former troops. Louis XVIII. withdrew from Paris
to Ghent, and Napoleon assumed his former dignity of Emperor of the
French.

Marshal Murat, the brother-in-law of Napoleon, by whom in 1808
he had been made King of Naples, upon Joseph Bonaparte being
constituted King of Spain, had, in January, 1814, signed a treaty
with England, and engaged to co-operate with the allies against
France. Napoleon’s triumphal return to France caused Murat to
espouse his cause, and he at once commenced hostilities against
Austria, issuing a proclamation asserting the independence of
Italy. Naples was thereupon invested by the Austrians, while an
English squadron entered the port and acted in co-operation.

The allied powers, however, refused to acknowledge the sovereignty
of Napoleon, and determined on his dethronement.

These events caused the THIRTY-FIRST regiment to be embarked at
Melazzo for Naples, where it arrived on the 25th of May. The city
had capitulated to the British fleet, under Admiral Lord Exmouth,
and the troops landed to hold possession until the restoration
of order in the kingdom, and Ferdinand IV. should be reinstated
on the throne of the Two Sicilies. After an exile of nine years,
this sovereign entered his capital on the 17th of June; on the
following day the hopes of Bonaparte were crushed by his defeat on
the memorable field of Waterloo, which victory triumphantly closed
the campaign; and on the 8th of July Louis XVIII. re-entered Paris,
and the Bourbon government was restored.

In the beginning of July the THIRTY-FIRST had sailed from the Bay
of Naples for Genoa, and remained there to support the arrangements
for restoring the Sardinian dominions to their original state.

Bonaparte was subsequently compelled to surrender himself a
prisoner on the 15th of July to Captain Maitland, commanding
the “Bellerophon” ship-of-war, and the island of St. Helena was
afterwards appointed for his residence. Murat’s career was equally
brief; he was driven from Italy, and withdrew to Corsica, from
which island he made a rash descent on the coast of Calabria. After
a sharp action he and his followers were taken prisoners. Murat was
tried by a military commission, and shot on the 15th of October.

[Sidenote: 1816]

[Sidenote: 1818]

In February, 1816, the THIRTY-FIRST regiment embarked for Malta,
and remained in that island until June, 1818, when it proceeded to
England, and landed at Deal on the 22nd of July.

On the return of the regiment to England it was stationed at Dover
Castle, Colchester, Chatham, and Sheerness.

[Sidenote: 1819]

In August, 1819, in consequence of disturbances in the
manufacturing districts, three companies of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment proceeded to Manchester, three to Macclesfield, and three
to Stockport. On the 10th of the same month the regiment was
employed in Manchester.

An assemblage of people, estimated at forty to sixty thousand,
took place on the 16th of August, in an open space in the town of
Manchester, named St. Peter’s Field, for the purpose of petitioning
Parliament. Such meetings having been forbidden by proclamation
some weeks previously, the military were employed by the civil
authorities in dispersing the crowd of persons who had entered the
town, with banners, some of which were of a menacing nature.

The troops of the garrison, the fifteenth hussars, the THIRTY-FIRST
and eighty-eighth regiments, with the Chester and Manchester
yeomanry cavalry, were ordered to be assembled in the vicinity,
under the senior officer, Lieut.-Colonel L’Estrange, of the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment. The yeomanry were engaged during part of the
day in dispersing the multitude, many of whom received injuries,
and eight or ten were killed. The regular troops behaved with
their usual coolness and discipline, in the delicate and important
duty they had to perform. The thanks of the Prince Regent, and of
the Magistrates, were communicated to the troops in the following
letters:--

      “Whitehall, 21st August, 1819.

  “SIR

  “I lost no time in laying before the Prince Regent your letter to
  me of the 17th August, together with the enclosure to yourself
  from Lieut.-Colonel L’Estrange, and I have great satisfaction
  in obeying the commands of His Royal Highness, by requesting
  that you will express to Lieut.-Colonel L’Estrange, and to the
  officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates, that served
  under his command at Manchester on the 16th of August, His Royal
  Highness’s high approbation of the exemplary manner in which
  they assisted and supported the civil authorities of the County
  Palatine of Lancaster on that day.

      “I have, &c.
      (Signed)      “SIDMOUTH.”


      “New Bailey Court-House, August 17th, 1819.

  “The Magistrates of the two counties of Lancaster and Chester,
  assembled at Manchester, request Lieut.-Colonel L’Estrange will
  accept for himself, and convey to the officers, non-commissioned
  officers, and privates under his command, their best and
  sincerest thanks, for the energy, tempered by the greatest
  humanity, displayed in their conduct yesterday, a conduct
  peculiarly characteristic of the British soldier.

      (Signed)       “WM. HUTTON, _Chairman_.”


[Sidenote: 1820]

The disturbances among the manufacturing classes having subsided,
the THIRTY-FIRST regiment left Manchester on the 2nd of June,
1820. The troops had been much harassed throughout the winter, in
consequence of the ill spirit which prevailed among the people
of the surrounding districts, and on the removal of the regiment
the municipal authorities of Manchester and Salford addressed a
letter to Lieut.-Colonel L’Estrange, expressing their regret at its
departure, and their esteem for its conduct during the eventful
period the corps was stationed in those towns.

On the 10th of June, 1820, the regiment arrived at Sunderland.

[Sidenote: 1821]

In February, 1821, the regiment marched from Sunderland to Port
Patrick, in Scotland, whence, on the 7th of March, it embarked for
Donaghadee, and on the following morning proceeded to Belfast.
While quartered in this town, the establishment was reduced from
ten companies of sixty-five rank and file, to eight companies of
seventy-two rank and file each.

During the period the head-quarters remained at Belfast,
detachments of the regiment were stationed in Coleraine,
Downpatrick, and Carrickfergus, where they were employed on the
revenue and other duties generally required from the army in
Ireland.

[Sidenote: 1822]

In April, 1822, the regiment was removed from Belfast and its
neighbourhood, occupying fresh quarters at Armagh, Newry, and
Dundalk.

[Sidenote: 1823]

[Sidenote: 1824]

The regiment, in October 1823, marched from Armagh to Naas, and
in January, 1824, proceeded to Dublin, where it occupied Richmond
barracks.

In the year 1824 the regiment received orders to prepare for
foreign service:--the island of Ceylon was, in the first instance,
selected as its destination, but it was eventually changed to
Bengal. On the 20th of July the left wing of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment marched to Kingstown, and embarked on board of transports
for Portsmouth, where it arrived on the 26th of July; the right
wing, following soon afterwards, joined on the 2nd of August, and
the regiment went into barracks at Gosport.

[Sidenote: 1825]

On the 12th of January, 1825, the regiment marched from Gosport for
Chatham, where it arrived on the 20th of that month. On the 7th of
February the regiment marched to Gravesend to embark for Calcutta:
the right wing on board the Honorable East India Company’s ship
“_Kent_,” under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Fearon; the left
wing on board the “Scaleby Castle,” under Major Tovey. The two
ships parted company off Portsmouth at the end of February, and
the “Scaleby Castle,” after making a favourable voyage, arrived at
Sangor, in the mouth of the Hoogley, on the 7th of June.

The men had been remarkably healthy during the long confinement on
board ship; two only had died during the passage, and only eight
were on the sick list when the vessel came to anchor. The men were
transferred, after a few days’ delay at Sangor Point, to sloops, a
particularly uncomfortable and clumsy description of vessel, then
used to transport troops up the River Hoogley from the sand-heads,
and on the 21st of June they arrived opposite Fort William, where
boats had been prepared to receive them, for they were not yet
destined to land. It was the 26th, however, before the left wing
was able to sail again; it was therefore five days, during the most
trying season of the year, confined in small thatched boats, which
were moored to the river’s bank: it nevertheless reached Berhampore
on the 2nd of July, with the loss of only one man.

Berhampore, on the Bhagaritty river, is the cantonment of the city
of Moorshedabad, and in 1825 was the depôt of the regiments on the
Bengal establishment, then on service in Burmah. The companies of
the left wing of the corps took possession of the barracks, and
remained in them till the 22nd of September.

_Madeley lith. 3 Wellington S^t Strand._

_For Cannon’s Military Records._]

The voyage of the _right_ wing of the regiment from England was
interrupted very early in its progress by one of the most unhappy
events that could befall a ship at sea. The _Kent_ took fire on the
1st of March, in the Bay of Biscay, and was totally destroyed: the
accident was first perceived about ten o’clock A.M., towards the
end of a violent gale of wind, when the sea was disturbed, and the
ship rolling heavily.

  “It was a little before this period that one of the officers of
  the ship, with the well-meant intention of ascertaining that
  all was fast below, descended with two of the sailors into the
  hold, where they carried with them, for safety, a light in a
  patent lantern, and seeing that the lamp burned dimly, took the
  precaution to hand it up to the orlop deck to be trimmed. Having
  afterwards discovered one of the spirit casks to be adrift, he
  sent the sailors for some billets of wood to secure it, but the
  ship in their absence having made a heavy lurch, the officer
  unfortunately dropped the light, and letting go his hold of the
  cask, in his eagerness to recover the lantern, it suddenly stove,
  and the spirits communicating with the lamp, the whole place was
  instantly in a blaze.”[25]

When all hopes of saving the ship vanished, exertions were made to
rescue the troops and the crew. Encouraged by the noble example
of their officers, the soldiers preserved the utmost order and
firmness in their perilous situation.

During the long and honorable services of the regiment, no
opportunity had occurred to put its discipline and conduct to
such a severe trial, but it brought from the ordeal a reputation
even more distinguished than it had previously gained. In the
field, when the spirits of men are excited by the animating
circumstances of the contest, where honor is sure and death
uncertain, valour and good order may be expected; but in the midst
of dangers against which it appeared hopeless to struggle,--at
a time when no aid appeared, and passively to die was all that
remained,--the manly resignation, the ready obedience, and the
unfailing discipline--characteristics of a good soldier--evinced
by the THIRTY-FIRST, entitle the regiment to dwell at some length,
in its Record, upon the events that called forth those admirable
qualities. Although Lieut.-Colonel Fearon and Major M‘Gregor were
most conspicuous, yet all who were on board deserve that their
names should be recorded.

In the following statement is shown the number of officers and men
of the THIRTY-FIRST embarked in the “Kent,” specifying also the
number saved:--

The following letters will explain the providential means of escape
afforded by the brig _Cambria_, and do justice to the humanity
and gallantry of Captain Cook, who commanded it, as well as of
his officers and crew. The name of this gallant officer must ever
be held in great estimation by the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, to him,
under Providence, it owes the power of being enabled to record the
many high qualities shown by its members in the extremity from
which he rescued them.

      “Brig Cambria, Falmouth, March 4, 1825.

  “GENTLEMEN,

  “You are aware of my leaving this port on the 24th ultimo, with
  passengers and goods for Mexico, and I beg to acquaint you of
  my return here this morning at one o’clock, under the following
  circumstances:--

  “On Tuesday last, the 1st instant, being then in latitude 47°
  30′ and longitude 9° 45′, laying-to, with a strong gale from
  the westward, under a close-reefed main-topsail, we discovered
  a large sail to the westward, and on approaching found her to
  have a signal of distress flying, which induced me immediately to
  render every assistance in my power, and on nearing, found her to
  be on fire.

  “About three P.M., being then on her bow, we succeeded in
  getting the first boat from the vessel, which proved to be the
  Hon. Company’s ship ‘Kent’ (Captain Cobb), of 1400 tons, for
  Bengal and China, with troops and passengers amounting, with the
  crew, to 637 souls. From three to eight P.M. the boats were
  constantly employed in bringing the people to the ‘Cambria,’ and
  succeeded in saving 296 officers, non-commissioned officers, and
  privates of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, 46 women and 52 children
  appertaining to ditto, 19 male and female private passengers,
  and Captain Cobb and 139 of the crew, amounting in all to 553.
  The flames now becoming exceedingly fierce, I could not urge the
  sailors again to return to the ship, nor deem it at all prudent
  for the preservation of the lives already on board my vessel to
  remain longer near the ‘Kent,’ expecting her instantly to blow
  up. By accounts since made it is supposed that 68 soldiers, 1
  woman and 21 children, and 4 of the crew were left when Captain
  Cobb quitted the vessel, whose conduct during the trying occasion
  is beyond my humble praise, displaying the greatest coolness and
  intrepidity, and by his exertions, and those of Colonel Fearon,
  the commander of the troops, who were the last to quit, the
  women, children, and passengers were got into the boats; and they
  did not leave themselves until their influence to induce any more
  to go into them was useless.

  “At two A.M. the ‘Kent’ blew up, after being completely enveloped
  in flames for four hours previously. The fire originated in
  the after-hold, where the spirits were stowed for the use of
  the troops; a cask of which breaking adrift, and bursting, the
  contents were unfortunately ignited by a candle in a lantern. I
  feel the greatest gratification in stating that the gentlemen
  and their Cornish miners, in all 36, with my own crew, 11 more,
  behaved throughout the trying period with the greatest kindness
  in getting the people from the boats, soothing their sufferings,
  giving up their own clothes and beds to the women and children,
  volunteering to go into the boats (which I had good reason to
  prevent), and leaving nothing undone to make them as comfortable
  as the limited size of my brig would allow (only 200 tons). It
  would be pleasing also could I speak as highly of the crew of the
  ‘Kent,’ but I cannot refrain from expressing my disappointment
  of their conduct (in which I am borne out by Captain Cobb)
  derogatory in every respect to the generally received character
  of a British seaman,--by refusing to return to the ‘Kent’ for the
  people, after the first trip, and requiring my utmost exertions
  and determination to compel them to renew their endeavours to
  get out the soldiers, passengers, and the remainder of their own
  shipmates, who were left behind; and it was only by coercive
  measures, in conjunction with my own crew and passengers, and
  telling them I would not receive them on board unless they did
  so, that they proceeded, though reluctantly, in their duty. I
  must, however, except the officers, particularly Mr. Thomson,
  fourth mate, and Mr. Phillips, the boatswain, whose conduct and
  behaviour, in every respect, justify my warmest praise.

  “It may not be amiss to state that, two hours after the ship blew
  up, a soldier’s wife was delivered of a fine boy on board the
  ‘Cambria,’ and both mother and child are doing well.

      “I remain, Gentlemen,
      “Your most obedient servant,
      (Signed)      “W. COOK.

  “To Messrs. Wm. Broad and Sons, “Agents to Lloyd’s.”


      “Falmouth, 4th March, 1825.

  “SIR,

  “It is with feelings of the deepest regret I have to report, for
  the information of His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief,
  the melancholy calamity which has befallen that portion of the
  THIRTY-FIRST regiment under my command, embarked on board the
  Honorable Company’s ship ‘Kent,’ for conveyance to Bengal, owing
  to her loss, she having taken fire towards the close of a heavy
  gale of wind on the 1st instant, about noon, in the Bay of
  Biscay. The moment it was discovered bursting from the after-hold
  of the vessel every possible effort was made to get it under,
  and by the immediate application of wet blankets, soldiers’
  great-coats, and other woollen articles that could be obtained
  on the emergency, we had for a short period every reason to hope
  these efforts would have proved successful; but, unhappily,
  having communicated to the spirits, the hope of extinguishing
  it was soon dispelled, and all further exertion to save the
  vessel appeared evidently vain; the conflagration, owing to the
  state of the weather, gaining ground so rapidly. Under these
  circumstances it became the imperative duty of Captain Cobb and
  myself to endeavour to save the lives of as many of the people
  as possible, for which purpose the boats were hoisted out, and
  some rafts hastily constructed, and as many of the women and
  children put into the former as we could at the moment assemble.
  At this instant, by the Divine interposition of Providence, a
  sail hove in sight, which, discerning our perilous situation,
  came promptly down to our relief; and, owing to the persevering
  heroism of the commander, at the evident risk of losing his own
  vessel, and by the cool and intrepid conduct of Captain Cobb,
  whose attentions were unremitting, a larger portion of the troops
  than could even have been anticipated under so unforeseen a
  calamity were preserved, though, I lament to add, sixty-eight
  men, one woman, and twenty-one children appear to have perished,
  exclusive of five seamen.

  “It is some alleviation to our afflictions to be enabled to
  state, that the origin of the fire is in no way attributable
  to the troops; a pleasing part of my duty to bear testimony
  to the cool and subordinate conduct of both officers and men
  under my command,--the former affording me every aid which so
  critical and trying an occasion demanded, and none more so than
  Major M‘Gregor, to whose collected counsel and manly example,
  throughout this agonizing scene of distress, I feel greatly
  indebted.

      “I have, &c.

      “Horse-Guards, 7th March, 1825.

  “SIR,

  “His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief has received, with
  sentiments of the deepest concern, your letter of the 4th
  instant, communicating the awful and afflicting calamity which
  has befallen the right wing of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment,
  embarked on board the Honorable Company’s ship ‘Kent.’

  “I am at the same time to observe, that if anything could
  alleviate the measure of His Royal Highness’s regret at the
  loss of the many valuable lives which have perished on this
  melancholy occasion, it would be the satisfaction experienced by
  the Commander-in-Chief at the safety of so large a proportion of
  the detachment, and which, by the happy interposition of Divine
  Providence, aided by your own collected firmness, and the united
  discipline and courage of Major M‘Gregor and the officers and men
  under your command, have been preserved for the future service of
  their country.

  “His Royal Highness commands me to add, that he appreciates in
  the fullest manner the heroic and humane assistance afforded to
  you by the master of the ‘Cambria’ brig; and that it will afford
  His Royal Highness the greatest satisfaction to bear testimony to
  it in any manner most calculated to advance the interests, or to
  do credit to the conduct, of this individual.

  “Arrangements have been made by the Quarter-Master-General
  for the transport of the detachment under your command by sea
  to Chatham, as soon as it is possible to obtain the necessary
  vessels from the Navy Board for that purpose; and I have
  further to acquaint you, that immediate measures will be taken
  for sending down to you, by the quickest inland carriage, the
  most essential articles of supply and equipment; and that the
  Commander-in-Chief will contribute, by every means in his power,
  to the restoration of your comforts, and the remuneration for
  the losses sustained by your officers and men, consistently with
  the regulations of the service.

  “Lieut.-Colonel Fearon, “Thirty-first Regiment, Falmouth.”

It was two hours after midnight when the ‘Kent’ blew up; all the
individuals of the regiment and of the crew that it had been
possible to save were now on board the “Cambria;” their number,
however, was diminished by sixty-eight men, one woman, and
twenty-one children:--about twenty of the former were left on the
poop of the vessel, when it became unsafe for a vessel to approach
her; whence, abandoning themselves to despair, they would make no
exertion to escape; it was absolutely necessary therefore to leave
them: others had thrown themselves into the sea, and were drowned
before help could be extended to them, or had come in contact with
part of the wreck and had been killed; while the anxiety of some
few to board the “Cambria” lost them their lives;--they were jammed
to death between the brig and the boats. The only woman lost was
suffocated in the orlop deck, with her three children; she was not
able to escape. Among the children lost there were four, three
girls and a boy, the family of Serjeant Jack, an old and deserving
soldier, who had seen much service with the second battalion in the
Peninsula. While the women and children were being lowered into
the boats, Mrs. Jack fell overboard; the serjeant leaped into the
sea to save his wife, and was not able to return to the ship. In
the confusion unavoidable on board, the children were overlooked;
missing their parents, they had sought refuge, it is supposed, in
the Colonel’s cabin, and no one knew, until it was too late, that
they were still on board; for the soldiers were not backward in
giving their aid to save the families of their comrades; there were
instances of men who tied the children of their brother soldiers on
their backs, and, leaping overboard, swam with their burdens to the
boats. There were indeed proofs among the non-commissioned officers
and soldiers of a fortitude, courage, and good-feeling that would
have done honor to the highest station. It happened, however, that
fourteen of the men, who had remained on the wreck, were picked
up the following morning, clinging to some portions of it, by the
“Caroline,” a vessel bound from the Mediterranean to Liverpool,
and carried by her into that port. The lives lost amounted,
therefore, to seventy-six, being two serjeants, two corporals, one
drummer, forty-nine privates, one woman, and twenty-one children,
as specified at page 82. The “Cambria” was of 200 tons only;
notwithstanding her crowded state, she providentially reached
Falmouth on the third day (the 4th March), when the regiment landed.

It is needless to observe that nothing was saved from the wreck,
and many had found it difficult to preserve even the clothes they
happened to have on at the time; the motley and forlorn appearance
the corps presented on its landing, was never equalled,--at any
rate, in the British army. The kind exertions of the gentry and
residents generally in Falmouth, to soften the sufferings of the
women and children, must ever be remembered with gratitude by the
regiment; the officers are more particularly indebted to this
calamity for the brotherly attention and friendship it procured for
them from the officers who then belonged to the Division of Royal
Marines at Chatham, where on the 26th of March it arrived, having
sailed on the 16th of that month in the “Diadem” transport from
Falmouth.

The following letter from the Military Secretary, Major-General
Sir Herbert Taylor, conveying the sentiments of his Royal Highness
the Duke of York of the conduct of the officers and men of the
regiment, will show that the discipline received approbation from
the quarter from which it was most valuable:--

      “Horse-Guards, March 9, 1825.

  “SIR,

  “The Court of Directors of the East India Company having
  transmitted to the Commander-in-Chief the report made to them
  by Captain Cobb of the circumstances attending the destruction
  of the ship ‘Kent’ by fire, on the 1st instant, I have received
  his Royal Highness’s commands to assure you of the high sense
  his Royal Highness entertains of the admirable conduct of the
  detachment of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment embarked in that ship
  under your command, and, more particularly, of the steadiness
  and coolness which you evinced, under circumstances so critical
  and trying. His Royal Highness is well aware that no occasion
  could offer in which the effects of a well-established system
  of discipline and subordination would be more apparent, or in
  which they would in a more important degree tend to assist
  the efforts of those who so nobly afforded their aid towards
  preserving the lives of all concerned;--and he desires that you
  will convey his thanks to the officers and soldiers forming
  the detachment embarked, under your orders, in the ship ‘Kent,’
  and assure them that he gives them due credit for their orderly
  and meritorious conduct. He considers his thanks to be due more
  especially to yourself, for the example which you set them, and
  for the persevering and gallant exertions which contributed so
  essentially to lessen the sad result of the catastrophe.

  “His Royal Highness orders me to add, that he shall deem it his
  duty to report to his Majesty a conduct, on your part and that
  of the officers and men committed to your charge, which so well
  deserves his Majesty’s approbation.

      “I have, &c.
      (Signed)      “H. TAYLOR.

  “Lieut.-Colonel Fearon, 31st Regt.”

His Majesty was graciously pleased to confer upon Lieut.-Colonel
Fearon the distinction of a Companion of the Bath, for his conduct
on the 1st of March.

On the 10th of April a detachment, from the head-quarters at
Chatham, marched to Gravesend, and embarked on board the “Charles
Grant,” under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Cassidy, who had,
a short time before, been appointed to the regiment. After a
good passage the “Charles Grant” reached Calcutta on the 16th of
August, when the detachment was ordered to Berhampore; it joined
the left wing in that cantonment on the 12th of September, when,
immediately on its landing, orders were received to return to Fort
William. On the 21st of the same month, the left wing, with the
detachment,--all under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Cassidy,--were
again embarked, and dropping down the river, in a few days reached
Fort William, and disembarking, marched into barracks in the fort
on the 27th of September.

On the 17th of November the head-quarters marched into Fort
William, and the regiment was once more together. This portion had
embarked on board the “Lord Hungerford” on the 21st of June, under
the command of Major Eagar.

The cholera broke out among the men of the regiment towards the end
of November, and not abating, the regiment moved into camp on the
south glacis of the fort. The ground was occupied on the 20th of
December, and the change was soon attended with advantage.

[Sidenote: 1826]

On the 18th of January 1826, another detachment, consisting of the
grenadier company, and part of No. 1, joined, and the strength
of the regiment was 39 officers, 50 serjeants, 17 drummers, 48
corporals, and 812 privates.

On the 13th of February the regiment embarked on the river Hoogley,
and left the ghaut below the fort for the Sunderbunds, on its route
to Dinapore, the Bhagaritty river, by which branch of the Ganges
it would have entered the main stream, being at this season of the
year too shallow for boats of such a size as composed the fleet.
The cholera unfortunately made its appearance during the voyage,
and carried off a great number of men. The disease was so sudden
in its attacks, and so quick in its effects, that the men scarcely
survived till assistance could reach them from the hospital, which
being always in the rear, the boat in which a sick man might be,
was ordered to drop down to it,--it therefore became necessary
to supply officers with a mixture to be given immediately to the
person seized: the sick man thus received aid from the nearest
boat to his own, and was saved until the more necessary treatment
could be used upon him. It was the 2nd of May before the regiment
reached Dinapore;--this cantonment is within a few miles of Patna,
midway between it and the junction of the Soane with the Ganges;
it is composed of two quadrangles, a larger and a smaller one, the
southern side of the former being occupied by two long buildings,
with a road dividing them in the centre; these formed the barracks,
each for a wing of a regiment, the remaining sides of the square
being the quarters of the officers;--the centre area is a smooth
greensward, used as a parade-ground; the river flows on the north
of the whole, and within a few yards of the quarters on that side.

At the end of the hot season of the year, the regiment was ordered
to Meerut, and commenced its first march in India, before daylight
on the morning of the 8th of November, under Lieut.-Colonel James
Cassidy, who had succeeded to the command of the THIRTY-FIRST,
Lieut.-Colonel Fearon having been appointed to the sixty-fourth
regiment on the 12th of January, 1826. The sick with the women and
children had been previously sent by water under Captain Bolton.

[Sidenote: 1827]

The route of the regiment lay across the Soane, which it passed at
Quilwur Ghaut, through the Shahabad district to Buxar, beneath the
fort of which place it crossed the Ganges by ferry, and marched
towards the military station of Ghazeepore, then occupied by the
forty-fourth regiment. After passing this post, the regiment
crossed the Goomtee by a bridge of boats, where it falls into
the Ganges, near the village of Kitee; then to the cantonment of
Seerole, near the city of Benares; again reached the banks of
the Ganges, at the little village of Joosey, and recrossed it
to Allahabad; thence the route lay through Kurrah, Futtehpore,
and Korah to Etawah, a city on the Jumna. From Etawah through
Shekohabad and Jellasir, in the province of Agra; passing the
dilapidated fort of Shasnee, the road led through the city of
Coel, to the celebrated fortress of Allyghur; thence by Khorjah
Bolundshuhur and Haupper to Meerut, where the regiment arrived
on the morning of Saturday, January 13th, 1827, after a march
of sixty-seven days, during which time the men continued very
healthy;--the number in hospital never exceeded thirty, many for
trifling cases, and but two men died.

On the same day the THIRTY-FIRST occupied the lines vacated by the
fourteenth regiment. Meerut was the head-quarters of a division
of the Bengal Army, commanded by Major-General Reynell; and a
considerable force was assembled, as a check upon Delhi, thirty-six
miles from Meerut, as well as upon the province of Rohilcund, on
the opposite shore of the Ganges.

The THIRTY-FIRST had been without colours since the destruction of
the “Kent,” but a new stand, which, for want of an opportunity,
had not yet been presented, was in possession of the regiment; and
the Governor-General of India, the Right Honorable Lord Amherst,
being at Delhi, in the course of a tour of the upper provinces, his
Lady was solicited to present the new colours to the regiment. They
were presented by her Ladyship on the 7th of March, 1827, and the
Governor-General addressed the following speech to Lieut.-Colonel
Cassidy on the occasion:--

  “I am persuaded that Lady Amherst will consider herself fortunate
  in having been selected to bear so distinguished a part in the
  ceremony of this day. It will be her earnest prayer that so dire
  a calamity as that which befell your former colours may never
  occur to these which she has had the honor to present to you.
  From the ordinary perils of war they are safe in your hands, and
  she confidently trusts that Her Majesty’s THIRTY-FIRST will ever
  march to victory under the colours now consigned to your charge.”

To celebrate the event, the officers of the regiment entertained
a large party at a ball and supper in their Mess-house.


[Sidenote: 1828]

During the years 1828 and 1829 the regiment continued at Meerut.

[Sidenote: 1829]

In 1829 orders were received to reduce the establishment of the
regiment to 736 rank and file.

The THIRTY-FIRST regiment was at this time stronger than it had
ever been; its effective strength amounted to 1086. The men were
young and in high health; the climate good, and the barracks
excellent, different from those at Dinapore; they consisted of
a certain number of detached buildings, each calculated for a
subdivision only: they were thatched, and had at the angles good
rooms for non-commissioned officers. New buildings were erected
of even a superior description, each company having four houses
allotted to it, with its proportion of non-commissioned officers’
rooms at the angles, as in the old buildings.

[Sidenote: 1831]

In the commencement of the year 1831 the north-west frontier of
India was reinforced, and the THIRTY-FIRST marched to Kurnaul, the
head-quarters of the Sirhind division. The regiment left Meerut on
the 27th of January, and halted that day at Sardhanna, the capital
of an independent state, under the celebrated Begum Sumroo. She
had been its ruler for a period of sixty years; and, a Mahometan
in her youth, she had adopted Christianity. The officers of the
regiment dined with her Highness.

It is five days’ march from Meerut to Kurnaul. On the 30th
of January the river Hinden was crossed by ferry, and on the
following day the river Jumna, when the regiment encamped in its
new quarters. The barracks had not then been built, Kurnaul never
having been occupied by a British regiment. The Native cantonment
was situated in front of the city, facing to the north.

The new lines marked out for the regiment were in front of the
right of the old lines facing the west, in which quarter an
extensive plain extends, without one tree to shade it, as far as
the eye can reach; in the rear flows the canal of Merdan Ali Khan,
a lively stream drawn from the Jumna at Rajghaut, fifty miles
above, and running to Delhi, eighty miles below. On the right are
long tracts of jungle, with a few villages and some cultivated land
near the bank of the canal, a little to the rear. The barracks were
detached buildings, two to each company.

General Sir Henry Warde, G.C.B., was appointed from the
sixty-eighth regiment to the Colonelcy of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment
on the 13th of April, 1831, in succession to General the Earl of
Mulgrave, G.C.B., deceased.

It was the month of June before the barracks were ready to receive
the men, until which time the regiment remained in camp. The
officers’ houses in rear of the barracks were built at their own
expense, it being the custom in the upper provinces of India to
possess property of this description; the inconvenience and
expense of establishing a cantonment are very severe at the time
on many, particularly on the junior officers. It is only, however,
when a cantonment is altogether abandoned that this custom can be
attended with loss. Kurnaul was likely to be permanent from its
position with regard to the Punjaub and the dominions of the Ameers
of Scinde, besides the great importance acquired every year by the
country beyond the Indus.

In October, 1831, the regiment marched to Roopur on the river
Sutlej, as part of the escort attached to the Governor-General,
Lord William Bentinck, who had arranged to have an interview at
that place with his Highness Runjeet Singh, the Ruler of the
Punjaub.

Having left Kurnaul on the 10th of October, the regiment reached
the ground allotted for the escort on the 22nd of that month; the
route lay through the Sikh territories, on the British side of the
Sutlej. Thennaiser, a spot of celebrated sanctity, and Umballa,
a populous city, were the only places of consequence, however,
on the march. The escort assembled at Roopur, to do honor to the
interview, was composed of two squadrons of the sixteenth Lancers,
with the band of that regiment, the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, two
battalions of native infantry (the 14th and 32nd), eight guns of
horse artillery, with two squadrons of irregular cavalry from
Colonel Skinner’s regiment.

The force Runjeet Singh had brought with him encamped, on the
morning of the 25th of October, on the opposite bank of the river,
and consisted of ten thousand of his best horse and six thousand
disciplined infantry. A bridge of boats had been thrown across the
river, and on the morning of the 26th of October the meeting took
place; the Chief of the Punjaub, accompanied by a deputation of
British officers that had gone to meet him, with a detachment of
3800 horse, 800 being disciplined dragoons, under General Allard,
a French officer in Runjeet’s service, crossed the river. All the
Sikh chiefs were in attendance on their Sovereign, and the train
passed through a street to the Governor-General’s camp, formed
by the sixteenth Lancers and the THIRTY-FIRST regiment. This is
not the place in which to dwell on the splendour or chivalrous
appearance of the scene, on the glitter of the polished armour of
some, and the gaiety of the yellow silk in which all were dressed.
The British troops were infinitely greater objects of interest
and curiosity to the Sikhs, than even the variety of the arms,
and the figures of the men of the latter, were to the former.
Runjeet Singh inquired into every thing connected with the arming
and disciplining of the THIRTY-FIRST with the keenest eye. During
a review of the corps, on a second visit, he rode close into
the line, and examined every movement, pointing out with great
intelligence to the Sirdars, or leaders, about him the evolutions
that he thought useful, or sending them to observe particularly how
they were performed. The THIRTY-FIRST regiment was not under arms
on the return visit. The farewell interview took place on the last
day of the month, with the same ceremony as that observed at the
first meeting.

The next morning (November 1st) the camps broke up; the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment returned, by the route it had come, to
Kurnaul, and arrived there on the 16th of November.

[Sidenote: 1832]

In the spring of the year 1832, Lieut.-Colonel Cassidy returned
to England in ill health, after having commanded the regiment
seven years. He was succeeded by Major Eagar, who died in December
following, when for nearly three years the command of the regiment
devolved upon the two senior Captains alternately.

[Sidenote: 1834]

On the 10th of October, 1834, Lieut.-General Sir Edward Barnes,
G.C.B., was appointed from the seventy-eighth regiment to the
Colonelcy of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, in succession to General
Sir Henry Warde, G.C.B., deceased.

[Sidenote: 1835]

In December, 1834, Major Bolton joined the regiment, and was
promoted, in November of the following year, to the rank of
Lieut.-Colonel, by purchase, Colonel Cassidy having been removed to
the charge of a recruiting district.

[Sidenote: 1836]

On the 20th of January, 1836, the regiment left Kurnaul on its
march to Dinapore, and, halting a day near Delhi, crossed the
Jumna below the city; thence, continuing through the Doab (land
between two rivers), to Allahabad, crossed the Ganges by a bridge
of boats above the fort. Having halted at Benares and Ghazeepore,
it recrossed the Ganges at Buxar, and arriving on the 26th of
March at Dinapore, again took up its quarters in the barracks it
had occupied ten years before;--although the weather was very hot,
and the regiment had marched without a day’s halt from Cawnpore
(thirty-one marches), there were only fifteen sick. From Kurnaul to
Dinapore the change of climate is very great, while the confinement
of the latter place, with the close and crowded state of the
barracks, after the open scene, the comfortable thatched buildings,
and the cold bracing winter air of the former station, were
severely felt. In Kurnaul the hospital list never exceeded seventy,
while it occasionally continued, during the hot weather, so low as
thirty, and in the cold season eight or nine, for months together.

[Sidenote: 1837]

During the summer of the year 1837, the thermometer remained at 115
degrees in the barracks for several days, and many deaths occurred
from apoplexy, produced by the great heat.

[Sidenote: 1838]

Lieut.-General Sir Colin Halkett, K.C.B. and G.C.H., was
appointed from the seventy-first regiment to the Colonelcy of the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment, on the 28th of March, 1838, in succession to
General Sir Edward Barnes, G.C.B., deceased.

On the 16th of November the THIRTY-FIRST marched towards
Ghazeepore, to relieve the forty-fourth regiment, and occupied the
barracks at that station on the 27th of that month. Ghazeepore
stands at the edge of a fine plain on the left bank of the Ganges,
close to the river. It is one of the frontier posts towards Nepaul,
is forty-six miles from Benares, and four hundred and six miles
from Calcutta.

[Sidenote: 1839]

The strength of the regiment had been reduced to six hundred and
thirty-two rank and file; it had at this period been fourteen years
in India, during which time the casualties by death amounted to
fourteen officers, and six hundred and seventy-seven men.

During this year the regiment remained cantoned at Ghazeepore,
under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Bolton; and was constantly
on the alert in expectation to march towards Nepaul to repel the
incursions of the Nepaulese.

On the 3rd of April, 1839, the regiment was augmented to an
establishment of ten companies, consisting of one colonel, two
lieut.-colonels, two majors, ten captains, thirty subalterns, six
staff, fifty-seven serjeants, nineteen drummers, and nine hundred
and seventy-six rank and file.

On the 13th of May, 1839, the regiment was inspected by
Major-General Cocks, of the Honorable East India Company’s Service,
who expressed, in high terms, his approbation of its appearance.

Ghazeepore was found very unhealthy during the rains, and the
regiment suffered severely, both in officers and men, from fever
and dysentery.

[Sidenote: 1840]

The regiment remained at Ghazeepore until the 12th of October,
1840, when orders were received to march to Agra, to relieve the
ninth foot. It arrived at Agra on the 30th of November, and its
effectives amounted to forty-one serjeants, and seven hundred rank
and file.

At Agra the regiment was more healthy than at the two former
stations, and its strength was increased during the year by a large
detachment of recruits from England.

[Sidenote: 1841]

In March, 1841, a large party of recruits joined the regiment under
the command of Major Skinner, through whose able management they
arrived in the highest possible order.

Owing to the indefatigable exertions of Lieut.-Colonel Bolton, the
commanding officer, little time elapsed before the regiment formed
a highly disciplined and most efficient battalion of 992 bayonets.

At this period the government of Shah Shoojah became so unpopular,
that the Affghans appeared determined to effect the expulsion of
the British, by whose aid he had been reinstated in the sovereignty
of Cabool in 1839, and whose presence was rendered necessary to
support his authority.

Towards the close of the year 1841, the Affghans broke out into
open insurrection; the British Envoy, Sir William McNaghten, and
Sir Alexander Burnes were treacherously murdered; and the British
troops, including the forty-fourth regiment, which occupied Cabool,
being compelled to evacuate and retreat towards Jellalabad, were
cut to pieces on the march.

_Jellalabad_ was soon beleaguered by the Affghans, and every
exertion was made to send succour from India to its little
garrison, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Sir Robert Sale, of the
thirteenth light infantry, who was serving with the rank of
Major-General in Affghanistan. Upon the breaking out of the
insurrection, the Major-General had been detached from Cabool
with a force, in order to reduce the insurgents, and, after much
hard fighting in the passes, had taken possession of Jellalabad,
the successful defence of which, by his small garrison, forms so
interesting a feature in the Affghan campaign.

[Sidenote: 1842]

The regiment was ordered to join a force collected at Peshawur,
in the north of the Punjaub, under Major-General Pollock; and on
the 15th of January, 1842, it marched from Agra, mustering 996
bayonets, in the highest state of discipline and efficiency.

On the 10th of March the Sutlej was crossed by means of a bridge
of boats (which had been constructed for the accommodation of the
British troops by the Sikh government) by the force under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel Bolton, of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment.
The force, which consisted of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, the
sixth native infantry, some troops of Tait’s irregular horse, and
Delafosse’s troop of horse artillery, arrived at Peshawur on the
21st of April, and was most hospitably entertained by General
Avitabile,[26] by order of the Maharajah Shere Singh.

Before the corps could join the army, Major-General Pollock forced
the Khyber Pass, and marched on to Jellalabad, at which place he
arrived on the 16th of April; the Affghans had, on the 7th of
April, been attacked, and defeated, by Major-General Sir Robert
Sale; Mahomed Akbar Khan was consequently obliged to abandon the
siege of Jellalabad, which he had blockaded since February, 1842.

The THIRTY-FIRST regiment, which had followed Major-General Pollock
by forced marches, joined at Jellalabad on the 5th of May,--after
making a halt for about five days at Peshawur,--having undergone
much privation on the way by the desertion of the camel-drivers:
several deaths occurred from famine and fatigue.

The army was halted in wretched tents at Jellalabad, the climate
of which is known to be so unhealthy during the summer as to cause
it to be used by the natives as a winter residence only. Soon the
effects of this displayed itself; the days became so oppressive
that both officers and men were obliged to dig deep holes
underground in which to shield themselves, in some slight measure,
from the burning heat of the sun. The thermometer rose as high as
126° in the tents, and man and beast fell stricken by the extreme
heat.

Neither was it in men alone that the army was daily losing its
efficiency. From the valley of Jellalabad having been so long the
seat of war, the fertile land had become a desert,--the wretched
half-starved camels could find no forage on the bare face of the
sand, and they died by hundreds; their dead bodies lying about in
all directions, swollen with the sun, and emitting the most horrid
exhalations, together with the filth and dirt of a standing camp of
50,000 men, added to the disease which raged among the troops. The
army suffered a loss which the most sanguinary encounter with the
enemy could not have exceeded.

At last, it was found necessary to divide the force, and the fourth
brigade, in which was the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, was ordered to
march under Brigadier Monteath to Peshbolak, in the Shinwaree
country, to punish some refractory tribes, which had behaved with
great treachery to a party of Jezailchees, who had been at the
former place, and to bring to submission the unruly Shinwarees,
who had attacked several convoys, and been guilty of many acts of
murder and plunder.

For the first month the regiment met with little opposition, and
the camel-thorn, a wild bush, on the leaves of which camels feed,
being found in great quantities, and large supplies of grain being
taken, the condition of the camels, horses, and other baggage
animals was much improved; the half-starved emaciated animals,
which had marched from Jellalabad, quickly recovered their wonted
vigour and efficiency. The warlike and turbulent Shinwaree tribes
retired before Brigadier Monteath’s brigade, until they sheltered
themselves in their strongholds, which were formed in a narrow
valley, strengthened by many forts and stockaded enclosures, while
the heights on either side were defended by numerous _sunghas_, or
breastworks of large stones, which were so constructed as to enable
them to dispute every inch of ground with an advancing force.

The brigade having arrived, and encamped about two miles from this
formidable position, a reconnoitring party was sent out, under the
command of Captain Willes, of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, to examine
the strength of the enemy’s preparations, and determine his exact
position. It was composed of two companies of the thirty-third
Native Infantry, with a few Jezailchees, or Native Light Infantry,
so named from the Jezail, or short rifle, with which they are
armed. This party, having proceeded some four or five miles from
the camp, was furiously attacked by a large force of Shinwarees,
and suffered severely from their fire, which was very effective
from the position they had taken up, and from which it required
a very considerable force to drive them: nevertheless the object
sought was fully obtained; the enemy’s position was correctly
ascertained, together with every requisite information for the
attack in force, after which the reconnoitring party returned to
the camp, sustaining a smart action the whole way back.

On the 26th of July Brigadier Monteath prepared to attack the
enemy near _Mazeena_ with his whole force; and accordingly,
leaving the camp standing under an efficient guard, he moved
towards the position occupied by the Affghans, who were prepared,
and nothing loth to meet him. Little time elapsed before the
engagement was commenced by the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, seconded by
the thirty-third and fifty-third Native Infantry, ascending the
heights, and driving the Shinwarees from their breastworks, and
along the ridges of the hills, while the tenth Light Cavalry, in
the valley below, charged them whenever they showed front on level
ground. The camp followers and pioneers had been furnished with
combustibles to burn the forts, as the Shinwarees were driven out
of them, which service was very efficiently performed. Meanwhile,
on the heights, the enemy disputed every foot of ground until
taken at the point of the bayonet, and Lieut. M‘Ilween, of the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment, was killed while gallantly leading an attack
of this kind against a vastly superior force.

The Affghans being driven from their defences, the artillery, under
the command of Captain Abbott, played upon them with great effect;
and after contesting the day until every fort and place of defence
had been taken and destroyed, they fled, dispersing themselves
among the neighbouring hills, where it was impossible to pursue
them. Their loss was very great, including most of their leaders.

The THIRTY-FIRST regiment had Lieut. Dalway M‘Ilveen _killed_, and
seven rank and file _wounded_; several men of the regiment died
suddenly from apoplexy, caused by the heat of the sun and want of
water. Thus ended the action of Mazeena, in which the behaviour of
the THIRTY-FIRST regiment elicited the highest commendation from
Brigadier Monteath, who stated, in his despatch of the 27th of
July, that

  “at one time the interiors of five-and-thirty forts were in a
  blaze along the valley, the enemy contemplating the scene from
  the heights in the vicinity of Secunder Khan’s fort, where they
  had taken up positions, and from whence they were driven in
  gallant style by the advance, consisting of the light and two
  battalion companies of Her Majesty’s THIRTY-FIRST regiment, the
  light companies of the thirty-third and fifty-third regiments
  of Native Infantry, and the corps of Jezailchees under _Major
  Skinner_, of Her Majesty’s THIRTY-FIRST regiment.

  “It gives me great pleasure to record the zealous conduct of
  the troops generally, and the cheerful and praiseworthy manner
  in which the soldiers of Her Majesty’s THIRTY-FIRST regiment
  laboured to drag the guns up such places as the horses,
  notwithstanding their unequalled qualities, were incapable of
  doing.

  “My thanks are very justly due to _Lieut.-Colonel Bolton_, of Her
  Majesty’s THIRTY-FIRST regiment, for the able manner in which he
  conducted the duties of covering the retirement of the force; and
  particularly so to _Major Skinner_ for the zealous and gallant
  manner in which he led the advance against the enemy.”

The Brigadier also acknowledged the services of other officers
belonging to the force under his command, in which number was
included Lieutenant and Adjutant Lugard, of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment, who acted as Major of Brigade.

The brigade of Brigadier-General Monteath, having thus performed
most successfully the service for which it had been detached, now
marched to join the main army at Jellalabad, and arriving there
took up its old ground. On the 22nd of August the army marched in
two divisions, and proceeded without opposition, but suffering
intense fatigue from the labour of dragging the artillery and
stores over the almost inaccessible paths, until it arrived at
Soorkhab, distant four marches from Jellalabad.

On the British leaving Soorkhab, the Affghans showed themselves
in force, and the rear-guard, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Bolton, was so hard-pressed by thousands of the irregular troops
of the enemy, that Brigadier Monteath thought it necessary to halt
the brigade at the entrance of the Jugdulluck pass, to enable it to
form a junction with the main column, which it did after suffering
considerable loss. The Ghilzees hotly contested the passage of the
pass, but after a sharp engagement they were driven off with much
slaughter.

In this action Lieut.-Colonel Bolton had his horse shot under him
in two places, and Lieutenant Shaw, of the regiment, was wounded.

The next day (9th September) the Affghans were so much dispirited
by their defeat, that the division marched to Jugdulluck without
further opposition than a little skirmishing with the rear-guard,
and Lieutenant Brooke, of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, was wounded.

On the 10th of September, it having been ascertained that Akbar
Khan with 20,000 men had established himself in the Khoord Cabool
pass, in order to cover the capital and fight a pitched battle with
the British, the second division was ordered to join the first by a
forced march to Tezeen, where Major-General Pollock was encamped.
This junction was effected on the 11th of September, with little
loss, although a running fight was kept up the greater part of the
way. In fact, the advance to Cabool was a succession of skirmishes,
oftentimes by night as well as by day.

The camp was attacked on the night of the 12th of September, but
the enemy made no impression, and little loss occurred, although
all the piquets of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment were engaged until
daybreak.

Shortly after daybreak on the 13th of September the army moved off
its ground towards the _Tezeen Pass_, the advanced guard, commanded
by Sir Robert Sale, being composed of three companies of the ninth
regiment, three companies of the thirteenth or Prince Albert’s
Light Infantry, together with two companies of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment, under Captain Baldwin and Lieutenant Greenwood.

After moving carefully along the pass for about two miles, the
Affghans were discovered, in great force, occupying strong
positions on the heights on either side, while their artillery
and cavalry were formed some distance farther on in the pass
itself. The action commenced by a heavy fire from the enemy on the
advanced guard of the British; and the distance being too great for
musketry, from the effect of which also the Affghans were covered
by extensive _sunghas_, or intrenchments formed of large blocks
of stone, for the whole length of their position, it was judged
necessary for the troops to ascend the heights, and drive them from
their posts at the point of the bayonet.

This service was most brilliantly performed on the left heights
by the ninth and THIRTY-FIRST regiments, and on the right by the
thirteenth light infantry.

The companies ascended the face of the mountain under a most
galling fire, from the effects of which many casualties occurred,
and not returning a shot until the ledge was gained: a combined
volley within ten yards of the enemy, followed by an immediate
charge of bayonets, drove him from his defences with great
slaughter, and the heights were gained. For this service Captain
Baldwin received the brevet rank of Major.

The Affghans’ advanced posts being driven in and pursued as far
as the broken and difficult nature of the country would admit,
they retired upon their supports, which were, with great judgment,
defended by endless _sunghas_, erected in every position from which
a fire could be brought on advancing troops.

The British, having gained the heights, and being reinforced by
fresh troops, pushed on, and, storming one intrenchment after
another, threw the Affghans into great confusion. The artillery,
having been brought up, played upon them with terrific effect,
while the British cavalry, having charged and overthrown their
horse, posted in the pass, and taken their guns, together with the
state tent of Akbar Khan, the fortune of the day at this early
period evidently smiled on the British arms; but the warlike
mountaineers, who composed the Affghan army, fought with desperate
valour to retrieve the day. Attack after attack was made upon the
troops occupying the posts from which the enemy had first been
driven. Reckless of life, the stern fanatics came on to be shot
down from the defences which they had themselves thrown up. In a
series of desultory attacks the day declined, and the British,
having obtained possession of every height commanding the pass,
the remains of the Affghan army made a _détour_ among the hills,
falling with great fury upon the British rear-guard, commanded by
Colonel Richmond, of the thirty-third regiment of Native Infantry.
Here they were so warmly received that their discomfiture was
completed, and the day was won. The victorious British encamped
for the night in the valley of Khoord (Little) Cabool, a village
distant about sixteen miles from Cabool.

In this action Lieutenant Pollard received a severe contusion from
a large block of stone while attempting to take a standard. Major
Skinner, of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, highly distinguished himself
with the force which was detached under his command, and which
proceeded, in the afternoon of the 12th of September, across the
hills towards the valley of Khoord Cabool by a route different from
that of the main army. On the march, Major Skinner came suddenly in
presence of a greatly superior number of Affghans. Notwithstanding
that the country was difficult and imperfectly known, by a series
of skilful manœuvres he extricated his troops from the perilous
situation in which they were placed, and defeated the Affghans, who
exceeded five times his force, with great slaughter, on the 13th of
September.

So complete was the defeat of the Affghan army on the 13th of
September, that Akbar Khan escaped from the field accompanied only
by a solitary horseman.

The enemy acknowledged to have lost fifty-three chiefs and persons
of consequence, and 700 men. The casualties on the part of the
British amounted to 185.

Major-General Pollock, in his despatch dated 14th of September,
again acknowledged the services of Lieut.-Colonel Bolton and Major
Skinner, of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment.

No impediments now existed to the advance of the British on the
city of Cabool. On the 15th of September the army arrived at
Cabool, and encamped on the race-course. On the following day the
place was occupied and the standard of England hoisted on the
highest pinnacle of the battlements of the Bala Hissar (Upper
Fort), on which occasion the flank companies of the THIRTY-FIRST
formed part of the guard which garrisoned the citadel. The British
colours were hoisted daily as long as the army remained at Cabool.

All the objects of the campaign having been gained, and the rescue
of the prisoners effected,--among whom were several officers
and ladies (Lady Sale, the partner of the gallant defender of
Jellalabad being among the number), also three serjeants, three
drummers, and thirty rank and file of Her Majesty’s forty-fourth
regiment,--the Anglo-Indian army commenced its march towards
Hindoostan on the 12th of October, after having destroyed the grand
bazaar of Cabool, named the Chahar Chuttah, where the remains
of the British Envoy had been exposed to public insult by the
infuriated Affghans.

The THIRTY-FIRST regiment was again constantly engaged in
desultory skirmishes with the Ghilzees and Afreedee tribes which
infested the passes.

At the _Jugdulluck Pass_ the Affghans again made head, and a severe
action occurred on the 18th of October, in which the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment sustained some loss, but the Ghilzees were put to flight
with great slaughter. Lieutenant Thomas Pender, of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment, received a severe wound near Seh Baba, from the effects
of which he died on the 18th of November.

Major-General McCaskill, in his despatch dated 20th of October,
1842, recording the attacks on his division by the predatory tribes
of the mountains between Tezeen and Gundamuck, stated that,

  “Throughout these affairs the conduct of the troops employed,
  including the second and sixteenth Native infantry, temporarily
  attached to me, has deserved my highest approbation, and I feel
  it to be my duty to record, that in the advance to Cabool, and
  in retiring from it, the bravery of that portion of the fourth
  brigade which took part in the active operations, namely, Her
  Majesty’s THIRTY-FIRST regiment, and a wing of the thirty-third
  Native infantry,--the remaining wing and the sixth Native
  infantry having been detained to garrison Jellalabad and
  Gundamuck,--as well as their endurance of privations and fatigue,
  have been beyond all praise. No troops could, in every respect,
  have behaved better; and I feel myself to be deeply indebted to
  Brigadier Monteath, C.B., and to Lieut.-Colonel Bolton, of Her
  Majesty’s THIRTY-FIRST, and to Lieut.-Colonel Richmond, of the
  thirty-third Native infantry, for the able and gallant manner in
  which they have been led.”

The THIRTY-FIRST regiment arrived at Jellalabad on the 23rd of
October, and, after destroying the fortifications, proceeded thence
on the 27th to Peshawur, where it arrived in the beginning of
November.

The campaign having now been brought to a close, the THIRTY-FIRST
reached Ferozepore on the 19th of December, having been in the
field for eleven months during this arduous campaign.

On arrival at Ferozepore the THIRTY-FIRST regiment joined the “Army
of Reserve,” which had been assembled on the frontier, and where
the Governor-General, Lord Ellenborough, and General Sir Jasper
Nicolls, the commander-in-chief in India, had proceeded to receive
the army of Affghanistan.

For his services connected with the command of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment, Lieut.-Colonel Bolton was made a Companion of the Bath,
and appointed aide-de-camp to the Queen, with the rank of colonel.

In testimony of the services of the THIRTY-FIRST during the
campaign in Affghanistan, Her Majesty was graciously pleased to
authorize the regiment to bear the word “CABOOL, 1842,” on the
regimental colour and appointments.

[Sidenote: 1843]

On the breaking up of the army at Ferozepore, the THIRTY-FIRST,
commanded by Colonel Bolton, was ordered to Umballa, a place
about 170 miles to the south, and which had never been previously
occupied by troops. Here the regiment arrived on the 27th of
January, 1843, and, cantonments having been marked out, barracks
were commenced for the men, and ground allotted for the erection of
bungalows for the officers.

On the 5th of May the THIRTY-FIRST sustained a severe loss by the
death of Major and Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Skinner, a zealous and
talented officer, whose services are frequently alluded to in the
historical record of the regiment.[27]

In May, 1843, the regiment was ordered to Khytul, and formed part
of a force under Major-General Fast, which was sent to reduce the
city and state of Khytul to British subjection. The force arrived
at Khytul after about a week’s march, and the enemy, after a slight
show of resistance, evacuated the city, which was occupied by the
British troops. All the objects of the expedition having been
fulfilled, the regiment returned to its cantonments at Umballa.
All, however, remained under canvas, exposed to most intense heat,
until July, 1843, when the men were housed, and a few of the
officers got shelter. In October, 1843, an outbreak occurred at
Lahore, and the Maharajah, Shere Singh, was shot at a review by his
brother-in-law, Ajeet Singh; after this event the youthful Dhuleep
Singh, a reputed son of the late Runjeet Singh, was placed on the
throne.

The THIRTY-FIRST regiment was in consequence ordered to the
frontier, and marched for Ferozepore on the 16th of November, where
it arrived on the 1st of December, 1843, and remained as a corps of
observation.

[Sidenote: 1844]

The THIRTY-FIRST, commanded by Colonel Bolton, C.B., continued at
Ferozepore, where the regiment was joined by ninety-three recruits
from England. On the 16th of January, 1844, the regiment was
inspected, and elicited great praise from Major-General Hunter
of the Company’s Service, and again on the 16th of February, by
Major-General Sir Robert Dick, K.C.B., who expressed great praise
as well of the soldierlike and gallant bearing as of the high state
of discipline of the regiment.

The weather becoming extremely hot, the regiment marched from
Ferozepore on the 19th of April, 1844, _en route_ to Umballa, where
it arrived on the 2nd of May.

On the 30th of December, 1844, his Excellency General Sir
Hugh Gough, Bart., Commander-in-Chief in India, inspected the
THIRTY-FIRST, in review order, on which occasion he expressed
himself highly satisfied with the soldierlike appearance of the
regiment.

[Sidenote: 1845]

On the 12th of March, 1845, a detachment of recruits and
volunteers, consisting of one major, one captain, three
lieutenants, two ensigns, one assistant-surgeon, with four hundred
and seventy-one rank and file, joined the regiment from the lower
provinces, under the command of Major Spence.

Many men continued to die from the effects of the Cabool campaign,
but the station in itself proved healthy until July, when it was
visited by cholera in a most fearful manner. On the 26th of July
the regiment was ordered into camp, about two miles from the
barracks, at a few hours’ notice, with orders for one officer per
company, as well as the medical officers, constantly to remain in
camp under Major Spence, where they continued until the 5th of
August. In one month the regiment lost by cholera eighty-nine men,
women, and children.

After the death of Maha Shere Singh, the Punjaub was in a state of
anarchy; the juvenile sovereign, Dhuleep Singh, under the tutelage
of his mother and uncle, was unable to control the turbulent Sikh
chieftains, and open hostility soon manifested itself against the
British Government in India.

In the beginning of December, 1845, the inclination of the Sikh
Sirdars to invade the British territories appeared to increase,
and about the 11th of that month, with a large army and a
well-appointed artillery, they actually crossed the Sutlej, the
boundary river which separates the Punjaub from the British
dominions.[28]

The Commander-in-Chief in India, General Sir Hugh Gough, sent
immediate orders for the Umballa division of the army, which had
lately been considerably increased in strength, to be pushed on
towards the invaded frontier.

Previous to its march, this force had been formed into divisions
and brigades. The first brigade of the first division was composed
of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, and two regiments of Native infantry,
viz., the twenty-fourth and forty-seventh regiments. The first
division was commanded by Major-General Sir Henry Smith; Colonel
Bolton, C.B., of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, was appointed Brigadier
to command the first brigade. Lieut.-Colonel Byrne, the next senior
officer, assumed the command of the regiment. Captain Garvock was
appointed Brigade-Major to the first brigade, and Captain Lugard,
Assistant-Adjutant-General to the first division.

It being of the utmost importance to aid the division of the army
in the defence of Ferozepore, a fort on the left bank of the
Sutlej, where the British Government had large magazines containing
munitions of war, a park of artillery, military stores, and
equipments for the field army, which protected the frontier, it
was necessary to push on the Umballa division, with all possible
speed, by rapid and forced marches, towards the point near which
the Sikhs, after having crossed the Sutlej, were assembled in
large force, emboldened by numbers, and their army composed of
well-disciplined troops, with a numerous and well-appointed
artillery. This army had been instructed and trained in European
tactics and discipline by French and Italian officers; it was
confident in its own strength and in the powerful aid of its
formidable artillery.

It was evidently the object of the enemy to prevent the junction
of the Umballa division with the Ferozepore field force, to cut
off the latter division, and to capture the fort and magazines of
Ferozepore, before the Umballa division could arrive at the scene
of action. The enemy hoped also to have a rich booty in the plunder
of the large town of Ferozepore. The Sikhs knew and calculated the
distance the Umballa troops had to march before they could reach
the vicinity of Ferozepore, one hundred and fifty miles, and the
nature of the country through which they had to march; but they did
not calculate on the energy, patient endurance of hardships, and
privation, which the British soldier would cheerfully undergo, when
he knew, that his brave and heroic Commander-in-Chief was leading
him in person against the foe, who had dared to invade the British
possessions.

On the 10th of December the THIRTY-FIRST received the order to
march, and the morning of the 12th saw the regiment leave Umballa,
mustering 30 officers and 844 men.

After long and harassing marches of twenty-five to thirty miles a
day, the severe nature of which it is impossible to describe, the
regiment arrived at the village of _Moodkee_ about two o’clock in
the afternoon of the 18th of December, having on that day performed
a march of not less than twenty-five miles: some idea may be
formed of the sufferings which the men endured from fatigue on
this eventful day, when it is known that at the last halt, about
two miles from Moodkee, scarcely _fifty_ men were left with the
colours; and for miles to the rear they might be seen staggering
forward through the soft sand in an exhausted state from want of
water and rest.

The soldiers were in the act of pitching their tents, and had
eaten nothing, when the alarm was given that the enemy was
close upon them in force. The THIRTY-FIRST rushed to arms, and
forming the right of the first brigade of the first division,
under Major-General Sir Henry Smith, formed in quarter-distance
column, left in front, advanced two or three miles, deployed on
the grenadier company, and so continued the line formed by the
regiments on their right.

The THIRTY-FIRST were now on ploughed land in front of a thick
jungle of thorny bushes, and moving forward under a heavy fire of
round and grape-shot, entered the jungle, through which it was
impossible to move in anything like a correct line, and beyond
which the Sikhs were formed. It was here that the gallant Colonel
Bolton received his death-wound;--his last emphatic words to the
men were, “_Steady_, THIRTY-FIRST, _and fire low_,”--when man
and horse came down together; but he did not allow himself to be
removed from the field until the action was over. The regiment now
found itself in front of a battery of fourteen or fifteen guns.
By this time the men were falling quickly under severe discharges
of grape from the guns, a few yards only distant, which were
also protected by a battalion of infantry, from which withering
volleys were sent into the ranks of the THIRTY-FIRST, who, however,
returned it with interest, and the intrepid valour of the men bore
down all opposition. One continued fire from the regiment laid low
nearly the whole of the enemy’s artillery-men opposed to its part
of the line, while the bayonet disposed of such of the remainder
of the foe as had not time to save themselves by flight. The
opposition of the Sikhs was desperate; but nothing could resist the
bravery of the British troops, who drove them from one position
after another with great slaughter: all their advanced guns
remained in the hands of the British.

It was not till an hour and a half after sunset that this hand to
hand conflict was over, when the rolling of musketry gradually died
away, and the British found themselves undisputed masters of the
field. Soon after the commencement of the action, Lieut.-Colonel
Byrne being severely wounded, the command of the regiment devolved
upon Major Spence, the senior major.

The regiment, being much broken and scattered over the field in
pursuit of the enemy, was re-formed in quarter-distance column, and
marched back to within about a mile of Moodkee, where it bivouacked
on the sand until daylight, and then returned to camp.

In this short but hard-fought action the regiment suffered
severely. Of 30 officers and 814 men, who went into action, 9
officers and 155 rank and file were killed or wounded.

The following officers were killed or wounded in the action at
Moodkee:--

  Colonel Bolton C.B.,        } Mortally wounded.
    commanding first brigade  }
  Lieut.-Colonel Byrne          Severely     ”
  Captain Willes                Mortally     ”
     ”  Bulkeley                Dangerously  ”
     ”  Young                   Dangerously  ”
     ”  Lugard                  Slightly     ”
  Lieut. Pollard                Slightly     ”
    ”    H. W. Hart             Killed.
    ”    Brenchley              Mortally     ”[29]
  Assistant-Surgeon Gahan,    } Mortally     ”
    9th foot, doing duty      }

In this action Lieutenant Bolton, of the twenty-first Fusiliers,
acted as aide-de-camp to his father Brigadier Bolton.

The army was commanded in the action by General Sir Hugh Gough, the
Commander-in-Chief, aided by the counsel and military experience of
the Governor-General, Sir Henry Hardinge. The following extract is
taken from the despatch of the Commander-in-Chief, dated 19th of
December, 1845:--

  “The opposition of the enemy was such as might have been expected
  from troops who had everything at stake, and who had long vaunted
  of being irresistible. Their ample and extended line, from their
  great superiority of numbers, far out-flanked ours; but this was
  counteracted by the flank movements of our cavalry. The attack
  of the infantry now commenced; and the roll of fire from this
  powerful arm soon convinced the Sikh army that they had met with
  a foe they little expected; and their whole force was driven from
  position after position with great slaughter, and the loss of
  seventeen pieces of artillery, some of them of heavy calibre; our
  infantry using that never-failing weapon, the bayonet, whenever
  the enemy stood. Night only saved them from worse disaster, for
  this stout conflict was maintained during an hour and a half of
  dim starlight, amidst a cloud of dust from the sandy plain, which
  yet more obscured every object.

  “I regret to say, this gallant and successful attack was
  attended with considerable loss. The force bivouacked upon the
  field for some hours, and only returned to its encampment after
  ascertaining that it had no enemy before it, and that night
  prevented the possibility of a regular advance in pursuit. * * *

  “I have every reason to be proud of, and gratified with, the
  exertions of the whole of the officers and troops of this army on
  this arduous occasion.”

It appears from the list of killed and wounded, that the first or
Major-General Sir Henry Smith’s division bore the brunt of the
action at Moodkee, as the casualties in that division out-numbered
those of the other two infantry divisions united, as will be seen
by the following published list:--


FIRST DIVISION OF INFANTRY.

          Officers.   Native Officers.   Serjeants.   Rank & File.

  Total       2              ..               5            79

The army of the Sikhs amounted, it is said, to upwards of 32,000
men of all arms. The British force did not amount to more than
one-third of that number.

Thus terminated the battle of _Moodkee_, the first action in which
the Sikhs measured their strength with British troops in the field.

The following extracts are taken from an account of the battle of
Moodkee:--

  “Between the 11th and 18th the army had marched over a distance
  of 160 miles, along roads of heavy sand; the incessant toil
  scarcely leaving them leisure to cook their food. Hardly an hour
  of repose was allowed them when they were summoned to renewed
  exertion. On the 18th the army took up their encamping ground
  in front of Moodkee. Our troops had scarcely time to prepare
  their food, when intelligence was brought that the enemy, 30,000
  strong, was close at hand. It was about three o’clock P.M.; the
  men were tired with incessant work, suffering from scarcity
  of water, and exhausted for want of nourishment and rest. The
  instant the order was given, however, they turned out with the
  utmost alacrity, as if fresh from their lines.”

After describing the preliminary movements of the cavalry and
artillery, the narrator proceeds:--

  “The afternoon was by this time far spent, and the evening
  at hand. The infantry, under Generals Smith, Gilbert, and
  McCaskill, pushed on in echellon right for the enemy’s line,
  now nearly invisible from the wood and approaching darkness. We
  were out-flanked and fearfully out-numbered. The struggle was
  tremendous. The Sikhs fought with the fury of desperate men.
  Nothing could resist the dauntless courage of our troops, and
  fearful was the storm of musketry poured forth by them as they
  rushed. The bayonet,--the never-failing resource of British
  soldiers,--completed the confusion and havoc the musketry had
  begun. Every position was forced; the enemy driven from the
  ground they had so well selected, and for a time so obstinately
  maintained; and night found eighteen pieces of artillery in our
  possession. Darkness only saved them from extreme disaster;
  and so fierce and unrelenting had been the fray, that it was
  maintained through an hour of dim starlight, while the dust of

It being expected that the Sikhs, notwithstanding their defeat on
the previous evening, would make a second attack, the troops were
ordered under arms early on the following morning, the 19th, and
remained so till evening, when, no enemy appearing, they returned
to their tents.

It having been subsequently ascertained, by scouts, that the enemy
was strongly entrenched in great numbers round the village of
Ferozeshah, the Commander-in-Chief determined to effect a junction
with the troops at Ferozepore, and with the combined force to drive
the Sikhs from their position. Accordingly at daylight on the 21st
of December the army was formed in separate columns of attack, and
marched in order of battle in the supposed direction of the enemy.
Having proceeded about five miles, it was ascertained that the
Sikhs had retired to their entrenched camp at _Ferozeshah_, about
twelve miles from Moodkee.

The troops then fell into columns of route, and after a very
fatiguing and circuitous march, rendered more so from no water
being procurable on the road, they arrived about three o’clock P.M.
in the neighbourhood of the enemy’s position, having, on the march,
effected the desired junction with the division under Major-General
Sir John Littler, consisting of five thousand men and twenty-one
guns, which had moved from Ferozepore on the morning of the 21st of
December: about a quarter of an hour was allowed for rest, and the
plan of battle was then immediately arranged. The first division
formed the reserve, and was drawn up in line, the THIRTY-FIRST
being about the centre: here they remained about twenty minutes,
during which time the round shot were passing through the ranks,
killing and wounding several men.

The order was now given to advance to the support of the troops,
who were hotly engaged and hard-pressed; the reserve moved
forward in excellent order, though darkness was coming on, and
very shortly became engaged and exposed to a heavy fire. The two
lines were shortly reduced to one, the shattered remains of the
reserve scarcely filling up the gaps formed in the first line by
the deadly fire of the enemy, who nobly fought, and fell every
man in his place; thus those _two_ lines, which had so shortly
before presented the regularity of a field-day, were now but _one_,
standing surrounded by their dead and dying comrades, and the brave
fellows of other European regiments could scarcely understand how
they came to be fighting in the ranks of the THIRTY-FIRST. After
a long and desperate contest, the Sikhs were driven from their
guns, but not without severe loss on the part of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment, both in officers and men. Lieut. and Adjutant Bernard
was killed on the spot, and Major Baldwin and Lieut. Pollard were
mortally wounded; Lieut. Pilkington was struck by two shots, one
passing through each ankle; and the horse of Major Spence was
shot under him. On the death of Lieutenant and Adjutant Bernard,
Lieutenant Robertson was appointed Adjutant, which appointment
he held until the nomination of Lieutenant Bolton was received
from the Horse Guards, he having been applied for by his father,
Colonel Bolton, previously to the campaign. The camp of the Sikhs
being now on fire in several places, mines and magazines exploding
with terrific violence at short intervals, the enemy’s fire being
silenced,--and their guns standing undefended,--the order was given
to fall back a short distance and re-form, which was accordingly
done; the troops bivouacked during the night in front of the Sikh
camp, within reach of shot from their guns, which, having been left
unspiked, were quickly reopened upon the exhausted troops, whose
sufferings on that fearful night, from thirst and intense cold,
will never be forgotten by those who endured them.

Towards morning the troops were formed in one line facing the
enemy; the THIRTY-FIRST happened to be on the right of the whole.
At the break of day, the British artillery opened on the enemy, who
returned their fire, and after a short cannonading the infantry
advanced to the attack: the THIRTY-FIRST moved steadily towards a
battery of seven guns on the enemy’s extreme left, which kept up a
continued fire of grape; it was, however, carried by the bayonet
without a single check, and almost without a shot being fired by
the assailants, though the loss of the THIRTY-FIRST was severe.
Having killed all the enemy’s artillery-men who remained at their
guns, the regiment, led by its brave commander, Major Spence,
passed through the battery, and advanced steadily in an excellent
line for about 300 yards, when it halted. The Governor-General and
the Commander-in-Chief passed down the ranks amidst the cheers of
the men; the line saluted them, dropping the regimental colours;
and private William Ash, a grenadier, stood in front of his company
displaying a colour taken from the enemy in the battery before
mentioned.

BATTLE OF FEROZESHAH. (2^{ND} DAY) 22^{ND} DECEMBER, 1845.

_Madeley lith. 3 Wellington S^t Strand._

_For Cannon’s Military Records_]

The defeat of the enemy now appearing to be complete, the soldiers
were allowed to go in search of water, the want of which was
severely felt. In the course of half an hour the alarm was suddenly
given, that the Sikhs were coming down in force; the troops were
quickly placed in position, though there could be no regularity
as regarded brigades, and on the near approach of the enemy’s
horse, the THIRTY-FIRST formed square, the Governor-General and
his Staff placing themselves in the centre: a terrific fire was
now opened upon the devoted troops (whose artillery ammunition
was expended) from the guns of Tej-Singh’s army advancing to the
support of the already defeated Sikhs, and the tide of victory
appeared about to turn, when Sir Henry Hardinge, glancing at the
small but undismayed band around him, exclaimed “THIRTY-FIRST,
remember _Albuhera_.” Line was, however, soon after re-formed, no
decided attack being made by the enemy, who nevertheless kept up
a galling and destructive fire from his guns. The THIRTY-FIRST
suffered very considerably without the power of retaliation, but
patiently maintained their position; at one time, when threatened
by cavalry, forming an oblong square of four deep, one side of the
square being composed of the twenty-ninth foot under Brigadier
Taylor of that corps, the twenty-ninth forming four deep to the
front, and the THIRTY-FIRST four deep to the rear, and in this
position they remained for some time, ready to receive cavalry.
The THIRTY-FIRST maintained their position upwards of three hours,
when they were once more enabled to go in search of water by the
sudden and precipitate retreat of the enemy. The water in the wells
was, however, found to be in such a putrid state, as to be nearly
useless, from the bodies of the dead having been thrown into them;
and the ground in the neighbourhood was extremely dangerous, having
been extensively mined.

The loss of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment at the battle of
_Ferozeshah_, on the 21st and 22nd of December, amounted to two
officers killed and six wounded.

The following officers were killed or wounded on this occasion:--

      Killed.                      Wounded.

  Lieut. Pollard.          Major Baldwin, mortally.

Captain Garvock, Major of Brigade, had his horse shot under him in
the advance to charge the enemy’s batteries.

On the 21st of December, Lieutenant Bolton was appointed to carry
orders from the Governor-General to Major-General Sir Henry
Smith, and was transferred from the twenty-first Fusiliers to the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment, to which he was appointed adjutant shortly
afterwards.

Lieutenant Pollard, a promising officer, was wounded at Moodkee;
but being a high-spirited young man, he would not remain behind,
when his regiment went into action at Ferozeshah, although
suffering from his wound, and advised to remain in his tent by
the medical officers. He went into action on horseback; his wound
being in the foot, he was unable to walk. At the desire of Sir
Henry Smith he was employed as second adjutant to convey the orders
of his commanding officer, Major Spence, who was so hoarse from
a severe cold which he had caught at the battle of Moodkee, that
he could not make himself sufficiently heard by the men; in the
performance of this duty this gallant young officer nobly fell.

  “The field after the retreat of the enemy was literally covered
  with dead,--they had abandoned large stores of grain, military
  stores, camp-equipage, and ammunition. The loss of the British
  army was very heavy; being opposed to a highly disciplined and
  organized army more than treble their number, with a field of
  artillery of battering calibre, admirably served, which kept
  up an incessant and destructive fire on the British troops:
  justifying the remark of an officer, who had been in all
  Napoleon’s great battles, that he never saw such devastation
  committed by artillery at any battle in Europe. What other army
  in the world would, under such circumstances, have, within thirty
  hours, stormed an entrenched camp, fought a general action, and
  sustained two considerable combats with the enemy? Within four
  days it dislodged from their positions 60,000 Sikh soldiers
  supported by 150 pieces of artillery, 108 of which the enemy
  acknowledged to have lost, and 91 of which fell into our hands.”

Another account of the action states:--

  “The right wing was commanded by the Commander-in-Chief in
  person; the left by the Governor-General. As our troops deployed
  into line, and prepared for an advance, a tremendous fire from
  upwards of one hundred pieces of artillery, 40 of them of
  battering size, was opened by the enemy. The right wing, under
  Sir Hugh Gough, threw themselves with matchless gallantry on the
  guns, and wrested them from the enemy, when the storm of shot
  from the Sikh infantry behind became so fearful, that a portion
  only of the intrenchments could be carried, when darkness put an
  end to the conflict.

  “Night had now closed in; the carnage had proved tremendous; our
  men thinned in numbers, harassed with forced marches, exhausted
  with fatigue, with little food and scarcely any water, and
  nothing whatever to cover them from the chill and heavy dew as
  the evening advanced, bivouacked amidst the dying and the dead,
  close under the intrenchments, and within reach of the shot of
  the enemy. All night long their artillery played upon us, and
  as the waning moon showed them our position, the cannon-shot
  ploughed up the ground right through, and amidst the wearied
  soldiers.

  “Morning at length approached, and our troops were once more
  arrayed for the fight. With daylight came retribution and triumph
  to our arms. Our infantry was formed in line, supported on both
  flanks by the horse artillery. A masked battery now began to play
  on us with fearful effect; the heavy shot of the Sikhs dismounted
  our guns; nine of our tumbrils were blown up. A general charge
  was now determined on; amidst a terrific storm of shot and shell,
  the troops rushed on undismayed; the carnage was fearful: battery
  after battery was carried at the bayonet’s point; the camp was
  pierced with loaded mines, which exploded with fearful slaughter
  as we advanced. The village of _Ferozeshah_ was stormed, and the
  enemy driven out of it at every point. When changing its front
  to the left, our force continued to sweep the camp, carrying
  everything before them.

  “Undisturbed and unbroken by the fearful service in which they
  had been engaged, the troops drew up, when the camp was won,
  and halted to cheer their generals on the field they had just
  conquered, with the regularity of a parade. Seventy-three
  guns had now been taken; 20 more quickly fell into our hands.
  We had lost 37 European and 17 Native officers, with 630
  non-commissioned officers and rank and file,--nearly 700 in all
  killed. Our casualties in killed and wounded amounted to 2415.”

The Commander-in-Chief in his despatch to the Governor-General,
after the battle of _Ferozeshah_, bears the following testimony
of his approbation of the gallant conduct of the army under his
command on that glorious occasion. At the conclusion of the
despatch General Sir Hugh Gough stated:--

  “On the conclusion of such a narrative as I have given, it is
  surely superfluous in me to say, that I am, and shall be, to the
  last moment of my existence, proud of the army which I had the
  honor to command on the 21st and 22nd instant. To its gallant
  exertions I owe the satisfaction of seeing such a victory
  achieved, and the glory of having my own name associated with it.”

On receipt in London of the despatch of the Governor-General of
India, announcing the victories of _Moodkee_ and _Ferozeshah_,
the thanks of both Houses of Parliament were voted unanimously
to the Governor-General, the Right Honorable Lieutenant-General
Sir Henry Hardinge,--to General Sir Hugh Gough, Bart., the
Commander-in-Chief,--and to the several officers under their
command,--for the eminent services rendered by them in the recent
arduous and successful operations;--also to the non-commissioned
officers and soldiers, European and Native, for the perseverance
and fortitude maintained by them at _Moodkee_ on the 18th of
December, 1845, and for the daring valour with which they forced
the enemy’s intrenchments at _Ferozeshah_ on the 21st and 22nd of
December, captured most of his guns, and finally compelled the
Sikh army, of greatly superior numbers, to retire within their own
frontiers.

The thanks of the Court of East India Directors were voted to the
army of the Sutlej at the same time.

The Court of East India Directors confirmed the grant of a medal to
all the officers and soldiers engaged in the battles of _Moodkee_
and _Ferozeshah_, denoting that they served in this important
campaign.

On the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of December, the army bivouacked on
the field of battle, having been, since the morning of the 20th,
without tents, or any regular supply of food; and owing to the
extreme heat by day, and intense cold by night, both officers and
men had suffered much. On the 24th the troops changed their ground
about four miles to Sultan Khan Walla, and three days afterwards
the regimental baggage arrived.

At Sultan Khan Walla they remained seven days; the whole army was
then moved to the banks of the Sutlej, not far from the fort of
Hurreekee, where large camps were formed. For nearly a week after
these terrible encounters, the Sikhs remained on the British side
of the Sutlej, the army being unable to follow up its victory,
as the troops, which were on their march to join, had not yet
arrived; the heavy artillery, which was on the march from Cawnpore,
was still very distant, and until the whole of the army was
concentrated, it would be impossible to attack the enemy, who had
again collected a formidable force of 70,000 men, with 110 pieces
of ordnance, which were encamped on the opposite side of the river,
and ready to oppose the British.

In the meantime the wounded officers and soldiers had been removed
to the hospital at Ferozepore.

Lieut.-Colonel Byrne being prevented from resuming the command of
the regiment by the severe wound he received at Moodkee, Major
Spence continued to exercise the command during the arduous
conflict of the 21st and 22nd of December at Ferozeshah, where he
showed an example of bravery to his distinguished regiment. He was
ably supported by every Officer and Man under his command. All
nobly performed their duty on this well-contested field.

Colonel Bolton, being mortally wounded at Moodkee, died on the
4th January, 1846;[30] and the Commander-in-Chief promoted Major
Spence, the senior major, to the Lieutenant-Colonelcy of the
regiment.

Major Baldwin also died of the wounds received at Ferozeshah.[31]
Captains Bulkeley and Young were promoted to the vacant majorities,
a promotion which they justly merited for their gallant conduct at
Moodkee, where both these officers were severely wounded.

Captain Willes, a meritorious and deserving officer, also died of
the wounds received at Moodkee. The THIRTY-FIRST regiment, now
greatly reduced in numbers from the heavy loss, both of officers
and men, sustained in the late arduous conflicts, still preserved
its spirit and energy, and was ready at a moment’s notice to be
led on to future victories.

On the 30th of December, the Governor-General published a General
Order, congratulating the Army on the recent victories, from which
the following are extracts:

  “The Governor-General again cordially congratulates His
  Excellency Sir Hugh Gough, G.C.B., on the great and important
  victories obtained by the army under his command.

  “The Governor-General, in the name of the government and of the
  people of India, gratefully acknowledges the noble services
  rendered to the public by His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief,
  by all the General and other Officers, and by the
  Non-Commissioned Officers and Soldiers of the brave Indian army.

  “The Governor-General’s thanks are due to all the infantry
  regiments of Her Majesty, and to the first European Light
  Infantry of the East India Company’s Service, all of which
  regiments distinguished themselves by the most devoted courage
  in braving the destructive fire of the enemy’s batteries, and
  valiantly capturing their guns.”

       *       *       *       *       *

Thus ended the year 1845. The Sikhs, after having suffered two
severe defeats, were preparing to renew the contest; they had made
large additions to their army, and had again collected a formidable
train of artillery.

[Sidenote: 1846]

On the 16th of January, 1846, the first brigade, with a few guns
and some Native cavalry, received sudden orders to march on the
following morning in the direction of Loodiana, under the command
of Major-General Sir Henry Smith; by a forced march on the
17th, the fort of _Dhurrumkote_ was surprised, and the garrison,
consisting of about three hundred men, laid down their arms, and
were sent prisoners to head-quarters. On the 20th of the same
month, this division was reinforced near the fort of Jugraon by the
sixteenth lancers, the fifty-third foot, a detachment of recruits
of the Queen’s regiments, and a troop of horse artillery.

The Major-General decided on attempting the relief of Loodiana,
which was but slightly garrisoned, and was threatened by a
large body of the enemy. Jugraon is distant from Loodiana about
twenty-five miles, and the road (if road it can be called) is over
a heavy and sandy soil. The troops were formed, and commenced
their march about one o’clock on the morning of the 21st; about
eleven A.M. the enemy was observed to be drawn up, parallel with
the British line of march, in a strong position at _Buddiwal_, his
front covered by a ridge of low sand-hills, bristling with forty
pieces of artillery, which were so placed that it was necessary,
in order to gain Loodiana, either to risk a battle to dislodge him
from a strong position,--which, with troops fatigued by a long
march, under a burning sun, and greatly inferior in numbers, would
have been a hazardous proceeding,--or to march along the entire
front of his position under a galling fire.

Major-General Sir Henry Smith, having a just confidence in the
steadiness of his troops, chose the latter. The infantry, formed in
open column of companies right in front (the grenadier company of
the THIRTY-FIRST leading), and ready at any moment to form line,
preceded by the artillery, and covered by the cavalry, marched at a
distance of five hundred yards, along the front of this formidable
line, receiving the fire of each battery as it bore upon them. The
regiment formed line on the grenadier company.

On this occasion, and under the fire of forty guns, the
THIRTY-FIRST received an order from Sir Henry Smith to change front
to the rear on the centre, a movement which was rendered necessary
by the manœuvres of the enemy, who had thrown forward his right in
such a manner as to get into the rear of the British; this movement
could not be attempted without the most perfect steadiness on the
part of the men, and it was performed in such a manner as to call
forth the praises of the Major-General. This was the first time
this manœuvre was ever done under fire of the enemy; after which,
the retirement of corps in line, covered by the sixteenth lancers,
to relieve Loodiana (the object being to relieve that place), was
beautifully executed.

The Sikh position being passed, and the enemy declining to follow,
by three o’clock in the afternoon the troops arrived at Loodiana,
thus effecting Sir Henry Smith’s object. In this affair the
THIRTY-FIRST lost 21 men killed and wounded; and 19 men, who had,
from the length and severity of the march, been unable to keep up
with the column, were taken prisoners. The greatest part of the
baggage belonging to the division was taken by the enemy.

On the 22nd and 23rd the troops were permitted to rest themselves
after their late fatigues, and on the 24th the enemy retired to
_Aliwal_, a village on the Sutlej. The British force moved to the
ground lately occupied by them at Buddiwal, where it was reinforced
by the second brigade of Sir Henry Smith’s division, consisting of
Her Majesty’s fiftieth foot, and forty-eighth Native infantry,
from head-quarters, with some cavalry and infantry from Loodiana.

On the 28th of January at daylight, Major-General Sir Henry Smith
marched with his whole force to attack the enemy under Sirdar
Runjoor Singh and the Rajah of Ladwa in their camps at Aliwal,
but found him, on approaching it, drawn up in line of battle,
with his left resting on the village. From information afterwards
received, it appeared that the Sikhs were about to march upon
Jugraon that very morning, for the purpose of getting between Sir
Henry Smith’s force and the heavy guns coming up from Delhi under
a very slender escort. The march having been previously conducted
in column of brigades at deploying distance, each brigade deployed
on its leading company, and thus formed one long line. The troops
advanced on the enemy, distant about one mile and a half, and
about ten A.M. the action was commenced by a heavy cannonade from
the Sikh artillery, which was principally directed on the British
centre. The village of _Aliwal_ was filled with infantry, supported
by cavalry in the rear, and further defended by two guns on its
left, immediately opposite that part of the line occupied by the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment. The village was carried, and the two guns
were captured.

The line, being somewhat disordered in carrying the village, was
quickly re-formed, and advanced in excellent order, carrying
everything before it. The attack of the enemy by the left wing
was equally successful. The line advanced, and made a steady and
successful charge; the enemy, being everywhere beaten, gave way,
and fled towards the river in the utmost confusion, leaving his
camp and fifty-two pieces of artillery, as trophies in the hands
of the victors. A standard was captured here by the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment; also a gurry, or gong.[32]

The advance of the British force in order of battle is thus
described by Major-General Sir Henry Smith in his despatch
containing an account of the action:--

  “As I neared the enemy, the ground became most favourable for
  troops to manœuvre, being open and hard grass-land. I ordered
  the cavalry to take ground to the right and left by brigades,
  thus displaying the heads of the infantry columns, and as they
  reached the high ground, I directed them to deploy into line.
  After deployment I observed the enemy’s left to outflank me; I
  therefore broke into open columns and took ground to my right;
  when I had gained sufficient ground, the troops wheeled into
  line: there was no dust; the sun shone brightly. These manœuvres
  were performed with the celerity and precision of the most
  correct field-day; the glistening of the bayonets and the swords
  of this order of battle was most imposing, and the line advanced.
  Scarcely had it moved forward 150 paces, when at ten o’clock
  the enemy opened a fierce cannonade from his whole line. At
  first his balls fell short, but quickly reached us. Thus upon
  him, and capable of better ascertaining his position, I was
  compelled to halt the line, though under fire, for a few moments,
  until I ascertained that by bringing up my right, and carrying
  the village of Aliwal, I could with great effect precipitate
  myself on his left and centre; I therefore quickly brought up
  Brigadier Godby’s brigade, and, with it and the first brigade
  under Brigadier Hicks, made a rapid and noble charge, carried
  the village and two guns of large calibre. The line I ordered
  to advance. Her Majesty’s THIRTY-FIRST regiment and the Native
  regiments contending for the front, the battle became general.
  * * * The battle was won; our troops advancing with the most
  perfect order to the common focus, the passage of the river.
  The enemy, completely hemmed in, were flying from our fire, and
  precipitating themselves in disordered masses into the ford and
  boats, in the utmost confusion and consternation. * * *

  “Thus ended the _Battle of Aliwal_, one of the most glorious
  victories ever achieved in India. By the united efforts of Her
  Majesty’s and the Honorable Company’s troops, every gun the enemy
  had, fell into our hands: fifty-two guns are now in the Ordnance,
  two sunk in the bed of the Sutlej, and two spiked on the opposite
  bank, making a total of fifty-six pieces of cannon captured or
  destroyed!

  “Having thus done justice, and justice alone, to the gallant
  troops his Excellency trusted to my command, I would gladly,
  if the limits of a despatch permitted me, do that justice to
  individuals all deserve. This cannot be; therefore I must confine
  myself to mention those officers whose continued services,
  experience, and standing placed them in conspicuous commands.”

After lauding the gallant service performed by the artillery, Sir
Henry Smith proceeds to state in his official despatch:--

  “To Brigadiers MacDowell and Stedman, commanding their gallant,
  brigades of cavalry, the fortune of the day is greatly indebted,
  and to all commanding officers of cavalry and infantry my warmest
  thanks are due; to Major Smyth, commanding the sixteenth lancers;
  to Lieut.-Colonel Spence, commanding Her Majesty’s THIRTY-FIRST
  foot; to Lieut.-Colonel Ryan, K.H., commanding Her Majesty’s
  fiftieth regiment; and to Lieut.-Colonel Phillips, commanding Her
  Majesty’s fifty-third foot.

  “His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief having witnessed the
  glorious services of Her Majesty’s THIRTY-FIRST and fiftieth
  regiments, I have only to report upon Her Majesty’s fifty-third,
  a young regiment, but veterans in daring gallantry and regularity.

  “To Captain Lugard (THIRTY-FIRST regiment) the
  Assistant-Adjutant-General of this force, I am deeply indebted,
  and the service still more so; a more cool, intrepid, and
  trustworthy officer cannot be brought forward.

  “The brigadiers all speak in high terms of their majors of
  brigade, Captain O’Hanlan, of the second brigade, and Captain
  Garvock, of Her Majesty’s THIRTY-FIRST foot, of the first
  brigade.”

The loss of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment in this conflict was
fortunately small: one officer, Lieut. Atty, slightly wounded, and
fifteen men killed and wounded. The troops bivouacked for the night
near the field of battle. The army remained at Aliwal five days,
during which the following General Order was received from General
Sir Hugh Gough, the Commander-in-Chief:--

  “GENERAL ORDERS TO THE ARMY OF THE SUTLEJ.

      “Head-Quarters, Camp, Nihalkee,
      “29th January, 1846.

  “A glorious victory, with the capture of all the enemy’s guns,
  having been achieved by the force under Major-General Sir Henry
  Smith, K.C.B., the whole line will parade at eight o’clock
  this morning for the inspection of the Right Honorable the
  Governor-General and his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, and
  a royal salute will be fired from the eighteen-pounder battery,
  and three cheers will be given by the line after the salute, in
  celebration of this triumphant event.”

The following extract is taken from the General Orders issued by
the Governor-General, dated “Camp, Ferozepore, 2nd of February,
1846:”--

  “Great praise is due to Brigadier Hicks, who, with Her Majesty’s
  THIRTY-FIRST regiment, the twenty-fourth and forty-seventh Native
  infantry, stormed the village of _Aliwal_, drove the enemy from
  it, and seized the guns by which it was defended.”

Extract of the despatch of the Governor-General of India to the
Secret Committee, dated “Camp, Kanha Kutchwa, 19th of February,
1846:”--

  “The immediate result of the victory of Aliwal was the evacuation
  by the Sikh garrisons of all the forts hitherto occupied by
  detachments of Lahore soldiers on this side of the river Sutlej,
  and the submission of the whole of the territory on the left
  bank of that river to the British government.

  “The Sikh army remained in its intrenched position; and though,
  on the first intelligence of the victory of Aliwal, and at the
  sight of the numerous bodies which floated from the neighbourhood
  of that battle-field to the bridge of boats at Sobraon, the Sikhs
  seemed much shaken and disheartened,--yet after a few days, the
  Sikh troops seemed to be as confident as ever of being able to
  defy us in their intrenched position, and to prevent our passage
  of the river.

  “The Commander-in-Chief was not in a state to take advantage of
  the enemy’s defeat at _Aliwal_, by an attack on his intrenched
  position at _Sobraon_, until the troops under Major-General
  Sir Henry Smith should have rejoined his Excellency’s camp,
  and the siege-train and ammunition should have arrived from
  Delhi. The first portion of the siege-train, with the reserved
  ammunition for 100 guns, reached the Commander-in-Chief’s camp
  on the 7th and 8th of February. On the latter day the brigades,
  which had been detached from the main army, rejoined the
  Commander-in-Chief.”

Notwithstanding the signal defeat in the battles of _Moodkee_,
_Ferozeshah_, and _Aliwal_, and the loss of 143 pieces of artillery
captured by the British in these actions, the enemy determined to
persevere in his rash project of invading the British dominions.
For this purpose he made extraordinary efforts; he had collected
all his available troops, and assembled a large army on the left
bank of the Sutlej, near the village of _Sobraon_. Here the Sikhs
formed an intrenched camp, defended by 30,000 men with 70 pieces
of artillery; this camp was supported by a large reserve on the
opposite side of the river, the communication being preserved by a
bridge of boats.

The THIRTY-FIRST regiment, under its distinguished and experienced
leader, Major-General Sir Henry Smith, rejoined the head-quarter
camp on the 8th of February, just in time for the crowning and
decisive victory of _Sobraon_. The arrival of Sir Henry Smith’s
force enabled the Commander-in-Chief to carry his plan of attacking
the enemy into execution. Two days were allowed, that this division
should rest after its fatigues.

The entrenched camp of the Sikhs was in a position judiciously
chosen in a bend of the river, about five or six miles from
the British camp. The defences of the enemy were constructed
scientifically by European engineers.

On the morning of the 10th of February, some hours before daylight,
the several divisions were silently formed in column of attack.
Major-General Sir Henry Smith’s division was on the extreme right;
it was formed into two lines; the first line consisted of the
first brigade, to which the THIRTY-FIRST regiment belonged, under
Lieut.-Colonel Spence: this line was supported by the second
brigade at a short distance in the rear. When the day dawned, the
first brigade found itself about three-quarters of a mile in front
of the enemy’s works. The cannonading, which commenced a little
after daylight, continued with little interruption, until about
nine A.M. A stray shot was now and then sent at the regiment, but
did no damage, when orders were given to the infantry to advance to
the attack. The men, who had been lying down, instantly jumped up,
formed line, and advanced.

The ground immediately in front of the enemy’s works was very
irregular, which made it difficult for the men to keep their
places. The enemy’s fire, which commenced at a distance of two
or three hundred yards, grew gradually more and more heavy; and
firing, as the Sikhs did, from behind lofty entrenchments at the
assaulting party, who offered a fair mark as they scrambled up the
ramparts, they shot down a number of the British troops, while the
survivors, after in vain attempting to reach the top, the loose
nature of the soil rendering the footing extremely insecure, were
compelled to fall back on the advancing second brigade, who saw
with indignation that the enemy were hacking the wounded.

The line was quickly re-formed and advanced a second time; the
same determined resistance was again made: but the men, burning to
revenge their comrades, would not be deterred. Here Lieut. Tritton,
bearing the Queen’s colour, was shot through the head; and Ensign
Jones,[33] who carried the regimental colour, was, nearly at the
same time, mortally wounded; the regimental colour, falling to
the ground, was seized by Serjeant Bernard M‘Cabe, who, rushing
forward, crossed the ditch and planted it on the ramparts. The men
cheering, scrambled into the works as best they could, and drove
the enemy, who were beaten at all points, before them into the
river, Lieut. Noel gallantly carrying the Queen’s colour in front
of the regiment, the staff of which was shivered in his hand.

The attack having been everywhere successful, the slaughter
of the Sikhs, as they crossed the river, was tremendous. Many
casualties, however, in the THIRTY-FIRST regiment occurred within
the enemy’s works. Lieutenant Timbrell was dangerously wounded by
a grape-shot, which broke both his thighs, and Lieutenant Elmslie
was also severely wounded by a musket-ball. Captain Garvock, Major
of Brigade, and Lieutenant and Adjutant Bolton, were both severely
wounded outside the works, where Lieutenants Gabbett and Law were
also wounded. Thirty-five rank and file were killed, and 102
wounded.

Two stands of colours were captured by the regiment, making four
stands altogether.

The first brigade, on this glorious occasion, was commanded by
Lieutenant-Colonel Spence, whose horse was shot during the advance,
and the sword in his hand bent nearly double by a grape-shot.

Captain White, the senior Captain, being left sick at Loodiana,
from the effects of the sun on service, Captain Longworth commanded
the regiment during the action. He was promoted for his gallant
conduct to be major in the army; his horse was killed under him.
Captains Garvock and Lugard were also promoted to be majors in the
army on the same occasion.

The following account of the action is given in Captain Longworth’s
despatch, dated 11th of February, 1846:--

      “Camp, Attia, 11th February, 1846.

  “SIR,

  “I have the honor to state for the information of the Brigadier,
  that H. M.’s THIRTY-FIRST regiment, under my command, marched
  from Camp Tulwondee yesterday morning at four A.M., in
  quarter-distance column, right in front, being the leading
  regiment of the first brigade, first division. We advanced in
  this order till within about two miles of the enemy’s position,
  and then halted, formed line, and waited till daybreak, when
  we advanced some distance and halted till sunrise, and again
  advancing halted with our right resting on the Sutlej within
  range of the enemy’s guns; here we remained about two hours, when
  we were ordered to advance. This was no sooner discovered by the
  enemy than they opened upon us a most tremendous fire of round
  shot from the whole of the guns upon the left flank of their
  intrenched camp; shell, grape, canister, and a very heavy fire of
  musketry were showered upon us as we neared the fortifications:
  but in spite of this, I am proud to say, the regiment advanced
  steadily and in the best order till within thirty paces of the
  intrenched camp, when a most destructive fire from overpowering
  numbers forced us to retire to a short distance, for the purpose
  of re-forming, as we left a full third of the regiment upon the
  ground; and I feel convinced that had the regiment remained for
  five minutes longer in its exposed situation it must have been
  annihilated, as our fire was totally ineffectual against the
  enemy’s strongly fortified position, which completely protected
  them, until by a desperate charge, in conjunction with H. M.’s
  Fiftieth Regiment, we succeeded in penetrating the extremity of
  their works extending to the river, and thereby were enabled to
  bring our fire to bear upon their gunners, who with the most
  desperate courage turned their guns upon the portion of their
  own camp in our possession, and fought till bayoneted where they
  stood. Their infantry in masses now retiring, we followed them
  up, and, in concert with the other branches of the army, shot and
  bayoneted them into the river, where immense numbers were brought
  down by our fire. Shortly after the battle was over the regiment
  was ordered into camp.

  “I beg to bring to your notice the gallant conduct of Serjeant
  M‘Cabe of the light company, who planted the regimental colour on
  the highest point of the enemy’s fortifications, and maintained
  his position under a most tremendous fire, the colour being
  completely riddled by the enemy’s shot;--he did this after the
  officer carrying the colour was shot.[34] I beg further to
  bring to your notice Private Williams of No. 7 company, and
  Private Biffin of the light company, who each took a colour from
  the enemy, one of which is supposed to have belonged to their
  artillery. I have much pleasure in expressing my high approbation
  of both officers and men under my command for their gallant
  conduct throughout the day. I regret to add that Lieutenant Law,
  my second in command, and Lieutenant and Adjutant Bolton, were
  both severely wounded.

On the 14th of February, 1846, the Governor-General published a
General Order, dated from his camp at Kussoor, from which the
following extracts are taken:--

  “The Governor-General, having received from his Excellency the
  Commander-in-Chief the despatch annexed, announces to the army
  and to the people of India, for the fourth time during this
  campaign, a most important and memorable victory obtained by the
  army of the Sutlej over the Sikh forces at _Sobraon_, on the 10th
  instant.

  “On that day the enemy’s strongly intrenched camp, defended by
  35,000 men and 67 pieces of artillery, exclusive of heavy guns on
  the opposite bank of the river, was stormed by the British Army
  under the immediate command of His Excellency Sir Hugh Gough,
  and in two hours the Sikh forces were driven into the river with
  immense loss, 67 guns being captured by the victors.

  “The Governor-General most cordially congratulates the
  Commander-in-Chief and the British Army on this exploit, one of
  the most daring ever achieved, by which in open day a triple line
  of breastworks, flanked by formidable redoubts, bristling with
  artillery, manned by thirty-two regular regiments of infantry,
  was assaulted, and carried by the forces under His Excellency’s
  command.

  “This important operation was most judiciously preceded by
  a cannonade from the heavy howitzers and mortars, which had
  arrived from Delhi on the 8th of February, the same day on which
  the forces under Major-General Sir Henry Smith, which had been
  detached to Loodiana, and had gained the victory of Aliwal,
  rejoined the Commander-in-Chief’s camp.

  “The British infantry, formed on the extreme left of the line,
  then advanced to the assault, and, in spite of every impediment,
  cleared the intrenchments and entered the enemy’s camp. Her
  Majesty’s tenth, fifty-third, and eightieth regiments, moving at
  a firm and steady pace, never fired a shot until they had passed
  the barriers opposed to them, a forbearance much to be commended,
  and most worthy of constant imitation, to which may be attributed
  the success of their first effort, and the small loss they
  sustained. The attack was crowned with the success it deserved!

  “The same gallant efforts, attended by the same success,
  distinguished the attack on the enemy’s left, made by the
  first division, under the command of Major-General Sir Henry
  Smith, K.C.B., in which the troops nobly sustained their former
  reputation.

  “These three divisions of infantry, concentrated within the
  enemy’s camp, drove the shattered forces into the river, with a
  loss which far exceeded that which the most experienced officers
  had ever witnessed.

  “Thus terminated, in the brief space of two hours, this most
  remarkable conflict, in which the military combinations of the
  Commander-in-Chief were fully and ably carried into effect with
  His Excellency’s characteristic energy; the enemy’s select
  regiments of regular infantry have been dispersed, and a large
  portion destroyed, with the loss, since the campaign began, of
  220 pieces of artillery taken in action. * * *

  “The Governor-General, in the name of the Government and
  of the people of India, offers to His Excellency the
  Commander-in-Chief,--to the General Officers, and all the
  Officers and Troops under their command, his grateful and
  heartfelt acknowledgments for the services they have performed.
  * * *

  “The Governor-General acknowledges the meritorious conduct of
  Brigadier Penny, and Lieut.-Colonel Spence,[35] commanding
  brigades in the first division.

  “Her Majesty’s THIRTY-FIRST and fiftieth regiments greatly
  distinguished themselves, as well as the forty-second and
  forty-seventh native infantry, and the Nusseeree battalion.”

The despatch of the Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Hugh Gough, to
the Governor-General, dated Camp, Kussoor, 13th of February, 1846,
giving a detailed account of the battle of Sobraon, contained the
following expressions of approbation and thanks:--

  “I have now to make the attempt,--difficult, nay impracticable,
  though I deem it,--of expressing in adequate terms my sense of
  obligation to those who especially aided me by their talents and
  self-devotion in the hard-fought field of _Sobraon_.

  “The major-generals of the divisions engaged deserve far more
  commendation than I am able, within the limits of a despatch, to
  bestow. * * *

  “Brigadier Penny and Lieut.-Colonel Spence commanded the two
  brigades of Major-General Sir Henry Smith’s division, and
  overcame at their head the most formidable opposition. I beg to
  bring both in the most earnest manner to your notice. * * *

[Illustration: THE THIRTY-FIRST REGIMENT

BATTLE OF SOBRAON 10^{TH} FEB^Y 1846

_Madeley lith. 3 Wellington S^t Strand._

_For Cannon’s Military Records_]

  “The Sikhs, even when at particular points their intrenchments
  were mastered with the bayonet, strove to regain them by the
  fiercest conflict, sword in hand. Nor was it until the cavalry
  of the left, under Major-General Sir Joseph Thackwell, had moved
  forward and ridden through the openings in the intrenchments
  made by our sappers, in single file, and re-formed as they passed
  them; and the third light dragoons, whom no obstacle usually held
  formidable by horse appears to check, had, on this day, as at
  Ferozeshah, galloped over and cut down the obstinate defenders of
  batteries and field-works, and until the full weight of _three
  divisions is of infantry_, with every field-artillery gun which
  could be sent to their aid, had been cast into the scale, that
  victory finally declared for the British.

  “The fire of the Sikhs first slackened and then nearly ceased,
  and the victors, then pressing them on every side, precipitated
  them in masses over their bridge and into the Sutlej, which
  a sudden rise of seven inches had rendered hardly fordable.
  In their efforts to reach the right bank through the deepened
  water, they suffered from our horse artillery a terrible carnage.
  Hundreds fell under this cannonade: hundreds upon hundreds
  were drowned in attempting the perilous passage. Their awful
  slaughter, confusion, and dismay were such as would have excited
  compassion in the hearts of their generous conquerors, if the
  Khalsa troops had not, in the earlier part of the action, sullied
  their gallantry by slaughtering and barbarously mangling every
  wounded soldier whom, in the vicissitudes of attack, the fortune
  of war left at their mercy.

  “Sixty-seven pieces of cannon, upwards of two hundred
  camel-swivels (zumboorucks), numerous standards, and vast
  munitions of war, captured by our troops, are the pledges and
  trophies of our victory.

  “The battle was over by eleven in the morning, and in the
  forenoon I caused our engineers to burn a part and to sink a part
  of the vaunted bridge of the Khalsa army, across which they had
  boastfully come once more to defy us, and to threaten India with
  ruin and devastation.

  “The consequences of this great action have yet to be fully
  developed. It has at least, in God’s providence, once more
  expelled the Sikhs from our territory, and planted our standards
  on the soil of the Punjaub. After occupying their intrenched
  position for nearly a month, the Khalsa army had perhaps mistaken
  the _caution_ which had induced us to wait for the necessary
  materiel, for _timidity_; but they must now deeply feel that the
  blow, which has fallen on them from the British arm, has only
  been the heavier for being long delayed.”

Lieut.-Colonel Spence, Captain Garvock (Major of Brigade),
and Captain Lugard (Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General) of the
THIRTY-FIRST, were specially mentioned in the above despatch.

At the close of a despatch dated Camp, Lahore, 22nd of February,
1846, the Governor-General added the following:--

  “The soldiers of the army of the Sutlej have not only proved
  their superior prowess in battle, but have on every occasion,
  with subordination and patience, endured the fatigues and
  privations inseparable from a state of active operations in the
  field.

  “The Governor-General has repeatedly expressed on his own part,
  and on that of the Government of India, admiration and gratitude
  for the important services which the army has rendered.

  “The Governor-General is now pleased to resolve, as a testimony
  of the approbation of the Government of India of the bravery,
  discipline, and soldierlike bearing of the army of the Sutlej,
  that all the generals, officers, non-commissioned officers, and
  privates, shall receive a gratuity of twelve months’ batta.”

In writing the history of the part borne by a regiment in the
brilliant victories of this glorious campaign, there are many
traits of individual heroism which should not pass unrecorded.
The modesty of true valour prevents officers, who have had an
opportunity of distinguishing themselves, from announcing their
own deeds, but the historian, who impartially records the service
of a corps, can have no such scruples. No hesitation is therefore
felt in giving a place in the records of the service of this
distinguished corps to the following extract from the Calcutta
Star, an Indian newspaper, which described the recent battles of
the Sutlej:--

  “THIRTY-FIRST REGIMENT.--This gallant old corps seems to have
  received more than its share of hard knocks, in the last four
  glorious battles it was engaged in. Lieut.-Colonel Spence who
  commanded in all four actions, seems to have had a charmed life,
  having escaped in a most astonishing way. He had two horses
  killed under him; balls through his cap and scabbard; his sword
  broken in his hand by grape-shot; and at Sobraon, a Sikh, who
  was lying apparently dead in the trenches, jumped up when he saw
  the Colonel’s head turned, and rushed at him to cut him down,
  which was only prevented by a private who called the Colonel’s
  attention to his danger, and afterwards bayoneted the Sikh, the
  Colonel’s sword having broken in the encounter.”

The glorious _Victory of Sobraon_ was decisive: the invaders were
repelled; their army, discomfited, retreated sullenly from the
field; the whole of their artillery, their camp, warlike stores,
and baggage fell into the hands of the victors; the enemy retired
over their bridge, which, from the weight and pressure of the
immense mass of the defeated troops passing over it, gave way; the
Sikhs were precipitated into the water; the whole river was filled
with the confused bodies of the flying enemy, the British artillery
playing on them with round and grape-shot; the stream was choked up
with the dead and dying: the carnage was frightful!

The enemy never attempted to rally. With the loss of his artillery,
on which all his confidence was placed, his spirit was broken,
and all his hopes of successfully resisting the British troops
vanished: his pride was humbled: the last and final struggle
was over; the battle was ended, and the power of the haughty
and turbulent Sikhs received a blow on the sanguinary field of
_Sobraon_ from which it could not recover: the city of _Lahore_ was
at the mercy of the conquerors.

Preparations were now made for the advance of the British army into
the Punjaub; the engineer department constructed a pontoon-bridge,
and the whole British force, with its artillery, passed the Sutlej,
and encamped on the opposite side, in the territory of the Sikhs:
the enemy, disheartened and dismayed by their late defeats offered
no opposition, retiring as the British army advanced. The distance
from the river Sutlej to the capital of the Sikhs is less than
fifty miles; the march to it was performed without opposition, and
without difficulty: the power of the Sikhs was prostrate; their
government sent chiefs of high rank as ambassadors to the British
camp, to offer terms of submission to the Governor-General, suing
for peace on whatever terms the conquerors might please to dictate.

Lieutenant Tritton died of his wounds on the evening of the battle,
and early the next morning the regiment marched towards the bridge
of boats, which was in progress at the nearest point on the Sutlej
to Ferozepore; on this march it was joined by a detachment of
sixty men under the command of Lieutenant M‘Kenzie, along with
Assistant-Surgeon Massey, who had just arrived from Umballa, being
part of an escort in charge of heavy guns, and an immense train
of ammunition hackeries, which they had hoped to bring up in time
for the last great battle, and were sadly disappointed to find
it was all over;--such are the chances of war!! On the 12th the
regiment was turned out at 10 o’clock P.M., and marching all night,
crossed the river in native boats at sunrise, along with a large
force under Sir Henry Smith, the band in the first boat playing
“Garry-Owen,” and the men in high spirits at the prospect of
entering the Punjaub.

This forced march was effected from a report having been sent to
the Commander-in-Chief, that the Sikhs were about to oppose the
crossing of the river, but no such demonstration took place. After
halting some days at Kussoor, which is one march from the Sutlej,
the army moved towards Lahore, marching at daylight every morning
in order of battle, and every regiment in brigade keeping its
own place through fields and jungles, forcing a way through every
obstacle, and ready to form line at any moment. It was indeed a
grand sight to see this splendid army on the morning of the 20th
of February approaching the city of Lahore, over a boundless and
perfectly open plain, on which it encamped about two miles from the
city. On the 22nd the British Standard was hoisted on the citadel,
and the event was announced to the army by the following General
Orders of the Governor-General:--

  GENERAL ORDERS BY THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF
  INDIA.

      “Camp, Lahore, 22nd February, 1846.

  “The British army has this day occupied the gateway of the
  citadel of _Lahore_, the Badshahee Mosque, and the Huzzooree Bagh.

  “The _Army of the Sutlej_ has now brought its operations in the
  field to a close, by the dispersion of the Sikh army, and the
  military occupation of Lahore, preceded by a series of the most
  triumphant successes ever recorded in the military history of
  India.

  “Compelled suddenly to assume the offensive by the unprovoked
  invasion of its territories, the British Army, under the command
  of its distinguished leader, has in sixty days defeated the
  Sikh forces in four general actions, has captured 220 pieces of
  field-artillery, and is now at the capital, dictating to the
  Lahore durbar the terms of a treaty, the conditions of which will
  tend to secure the British provinces from the repetition of a
  similar outrage.”

The decisive termination of the war in the Punjaub enabled the
Governor-General and the Supreme Council to reduce the number of
the Queen’s regular regiments in India. An order was accordingly
issued for the return of the THIRTY-FIRST to Europe, but as it
was desirable to retain all the efficient men who were willing to
continue their services in India, the soldiers were permitted to
volunteer into the other regiments serving in the Bengal Presidency.

A General Order was issued permitting the soldiers of the sixteenth
lancers and the THIRTY-FIRST regiment to volunteer into other
corps; the volunteering of the THIRTY-FIRST to commence on the 26th
and to close on the 28th of February.

The regiment now mustered only 420 bayonets fit for duty out of 844
which left Umballa, and during these three days 103 men volunteered
to other corps; at Umballa, on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th of March,
it again volunteered 214 men; and at Chinsurah, on the 10th of
July, 12 men, in all 329, who remained in India. Within the last
few years, the regiment had gained a considerable accession to
its strength by volunteers from corps leaving India: these men,
whose object in volunteering was to remain in India, again availed
themselves of the General Order granting them a bounty, of thirty
rupees, and volunteered into other corps with which they had served
during the late campaign.

After the authority for volunteering had taken effect the strength
of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment was much reduced: all the young
soldiers who were desirous of serving in India volunteered into
other regiments. Several of the officers exchanged into corps
remaining in India: Lieut.-Colonel Byrne into the fifty-third
regiment; Major Young into the tenth; and Brevet Major Lugard into
the twenty-ninth.

On the publication of the General Order for the return of the
regiment to Europe,--the following Division Order was issued
by Major-General Sir Henry Smith, K.C.B., commanding the first
division:--

      “Camp, Lahore, 3rd March, 1846.

  “Comrades,--Officers and Soldiers of the gallant THIRTY-FIRST
  regiment,--you and I have been so associated in the recent
  conflicts, where your services have been distinguished, that I
  cannot lose you from under my command without an expression of
  the deepest regret; that regret is however mitigated, when I know
  that you are about to return to your native country, from which
  the regiment has been absent twenty-one years,--much diminished
  in numbers,--caused by your valiant conduct and recent glorious
  victories; but the former renown of your distinguished corps has
  acquired additional fame, by the valour of Lieut.-Colonel Spence,
  the officers, and soldiers; and the long list of triumphant
  victories now recorded on your colours, has been much increased
  by your services in India. Farewell, my gallant comrades, for
  the present; may every success, happiness, honor, and prosperity
  attend you, the gallant THIRTY-FIRST regiment, in peace, as it
  has so gloriously done in war! and, believe me, one of the most
  happy and proud recollections of my life will be that I have
  witnessed the indomitable valour of the corps.”

On the same occasion the following Brigade Orders were issued
by Brigadier Monteath, who commanded the brigade in which the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment served in the Cabool campaign:--

  BRIGADE ORDERS BY BRIGADIER MONTEATH, C.B.

      “Camp, Lahore, 3rd March, 1846.

  “Her Majesty’s THIRTY-FIRST regiment being now about to quit
  the army, Brigadier Monteath cannot allow it to depart without
  expressing the deep regret he feels at the approaching separation
  from those to whom he has been bound by so many ties of friendly
  feeling for their private good qualities, and high admiration for
  their public services. On a former occasion, when associated with
  them under the most difficult and trying circumstances, he had
  the gratification of recording, that the regiment had exhibited,
  in a high degree, the best qualities of the best British
  soldiers; and he has now the proud pleasure of telling them, that
  by their gallant conduct during the late sanguinary conflicts
  with the enemy, they have encircled themselves with every honor,
  nobly maintained the former character of the regiment, and
  placed its number amongst the foremost of those whose military
  achievements are most conspicuously engraved upon the records
  of their country; and he sincerely prays, on their arrival in
  England, that their beloved Sovereign may be induced to confer
  such marks of distinction upon the regiment as its gallant deeds
  so eminently deserve.

  “Farewell, my gallant comrades; may every happiness and
  prosperity attend you. Your old Commander will ever remember you
  with pleasure, and watch your future progress with all the deep
  interest of your firmest friends.

      “By order,
      (Signed)      “G. A. TYTLER, Brigade-Major.”

The Commander-in-Chief in India, having deemed it advisable to
send home as many of the severely wounded men of the army as
possible, before the beginning of the hot weather, gave orders for
the boats to be prepared on the Sutlej to convey them to Bombay,
and the command of this detachment was given by His Excellency to
Lieutenant Robertson, of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment. It consisted
of about 158 men of all the European corps lately engaged, and
an escort of 63 duty men of the THIRTY-FIRST, making in all 221,
97 of which belonged to the regiment. The detachment sailed from
Ferozepore on the 14th of March, 1846, and arrived safely at
Bombay on the 27th of April, whence it embarked on board the ship
‘Herefordshire’ on the 14th of May, and landed at Gravesend on the
29th of September, 1846, being the first portion of the regiment
that arrived in England.

On the 28th of February the officers of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment
were specially invited to dinner by Lieut.-General Lord Hardinge,
the Governor-General, and on the 3rd of March the same honor was
conferred on them by General Lord Gough, the Commander-in-Chief in
India.

The volunteering being completed, the volunteers were delivered
over to their new corps. The regiment separated from the army with
which it had gained such distinguished renown, and commenced its
march on the 4th of March towards Ghurmuktesir Ghât, on the river
Ganges, where boats were prepared for its conveyance to Calcutta.
The regiment recrossed the river Sutlej on the 7th of March, and on
the 20th reached Umballa.

The women, children, and baggage of the regiment, having been
left at Umballa when the regiment proceeded on service, a halt
was required to enable the officers to arrange their affairs and
dispose of their property, and that of the deceased officers
and men; the houses which the officers occupied being their own
property and built by themselves, as they were the first to inhabit
the station when it was formed into a new cantonment in 1843.

The regiment moved again on the 28th of March, and, passing through
the station of Meerut, arrived at Ghurmuktesir Ghât, on the right
bank of the Ganges, on the 13th of April.

The boats provided by the commissariat for the conveyance of the
regiment to Calcutta being in readiness for the voyage, the wounded
and sick men, women, and children were embarked with as little
delay as possible. By the 16th of April the whole were embarked,
and the fleet of boats sailed for the Presidency of Calcutta on the
following day.

Lieut.-Colonel Spence, after having commanded the regiment in every
action during this brilliant and glorious campaign,--at _Moodkee_
on the 18th of December, _Ferozeshah_ on the 21st and 22nd of
December, 1845, _Buddiwal_ on the 21st of January, _Aliwal_ on the
28th, and on the 10th of February, 1846, at the crowning victory at
_Sobraon_,--had now the satisfaction of embarking with it on board
the boats appointed to convey it to the port of Calcutta, where
the ships lay at anchor, which were engaged to carry the war-worn
veterans of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment to their native country.

On the 3rd of April Her Majesty was pleased to appoint
Lieut.-Colonel Byrne and Lieut.-Colonel Spence, of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment, to be Companions of the Most Honorable Military Order of
the Bath, for their distinguished gallantry in the late actions on
the Sutlej.

In consequence of the particularly gallant conduct of Serjeant
Bernard M‘Cabe, Major-General Sir Henry Smith, in a letter dated
17th February, was pleased to recommend him for a commission, in
the following terms:--“This intrepid non-commissioned officer,
in the midst of a hand-to-hand conflict with the enemy, planted
the colour of Her Majesty’s THIRTY-FIRST regiment upon one of the
towers of the enemy’s intrenchments,--one of the most bold and
daring acts of a gallant soldier I ever witnessed, and which, I now
deliberately consider, tended much to shorten the struggle alluded
to. This serjeant is a young man of excellent character, and, if I
may be permitted to remind His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief of
the promise made me almost in the heat of battle, it is,--‘_This
Serjeant shall be recommended for a commission_.’ I can only add
(which is unnecessary to the soldiers’ friend, Sir Hugh Gough)
that, if he receives a commission, it will be as gratifying to
me as was the gallant conduct I witnessed at the moment the
colour-head was shot off, and the flag perforated with balls, as he
triumphantly waved it in the air in the very midst of the enemy.”

This highly honorable testimony of the bravery of Serjeant
M‘Cabe at the battle of Sobraon, was supported by the strong
recommendation of General Lord Gough to His Grace the
Commander-in-Chief, and Serjeant Bernard M‘Cabe was appointed by
Her Majesty to an ensigncy in the Eighteenth, Royal Irish, regiment
of foot, on the 8th of May, 1846.

The details of the campaign on the Sutlej afford abundant proofs
of the skill and bravery of the troops: the highest praise is due,
and has been rendered by their admiring and grateful countrymen,
to the officers and soldiers by whose gallantry four battles were
fought, and victories obtained, in sixty days, over an enemy who
had most ample means of equipping and supplying his corps with all
the _matériel_ of war, and of choosing his own time and opportunity
of commencing his perfidious attack.

The army of the Sikhs, at the commencement of this unprovoked
aggression, is ascertained to have amounted to 60,000 men, and
their artillery to 108 pieces of cannon, some of them being of
large calibre.

The Anglo-Indian forces, which had been hastily collected to
contend against this immense army, amounted only to about 20,000
men, a great proportion of which had marched one hundred and sixty
miles, in order to arrive at the seat of war.

Under the most serious disadvantages, fatigues, and privations,
the British troops, with the aid of their faithful allies, the
Native corps, nobly contended with their Sikh adversaries, “who, in
spite of their exceeding numbers and advantageous positions, were
vanquished in every battle.”

In expressing admiration of the heroic conduct of the British
troops in this short but decisive war, it is the duty of the nation
to acknowledge, with gratitude, the wonderful interference of a
Supreme Power, by whose all-wise decree the army of the Sikhs was
destroyed and dispersed; and, notwithstanding its numbers, received
a complete and signal overthrow, as a just but severe punishment
for its faithless conduct and daring violation of every honorable
and religious feeling.

When it is considered that with a disparity of force of three to
one, independent of artillery, the Sikh army was discomfited, and
the enemy was driven back to his capital to seek for safety and
peace, the British Nation must be sensible that an over-ruling
Power aided their cause, and gave strength where numbers were
deficient; and that another signal instance of Divine favour and
protection has been added to the numerous claims which demand the
nation’s humble acknowledgment and gratitude.

The campaign on the Sutlej having terminated by the destruction
of the Sikh army and the capture of the city of Lahore, a treaty
of peace was entered into. The Sikh government requested that a
force of 10,000 British troops might be left at their capital for
the protection of the city and the maintenance of good order: this
being complied with, arrangements were made for the return of the
British army to the territories of the East India Company.

The glorious news of the Battle of Sobraon was received in London
on the 1st of April, and was announced to the British public by a
royal salute from the guns of the Tower and in St. James’s Park;
and the royal standard was displayed at Buckingham Palace and at
the Tower of London. The greatest sensation pervaded all ranks of
society: no military event, with the exception of the Battle of
Waterloo, excited such wonder and surprise, mingled with joy, that
the cloud, which had hung over the fate of the British Empire in
India, was completely dissipated by this last splendid and decisive
victory, which effected the final overthrow of the power of the
Sikhs, the destruction of their army, and the capture of their
artillery, on the sanguinary field of _Sobraon_.

On the 2nd of April the Thanks of the House of Lords were proposed
by the Earl of Ripon, and carried unanimously.

  _Extracts from Minutes of Proceedings of the House of Lords.--2nd
  April, 1846._

  “That the Thanks of this House be given to Major-General Sir
  Henry George Smith, Knight Commander of the Most Honorable
  Military Order of the Bath, for his skilful and meritorious
  conduct when in command of the British troops employed against a
  large portion of the Sikh army, of greatly superior numbers, and
  for the signal valour and judgment displayed by him in the battle
  of the 28th of January, 1846, when the enemy’s force was totally
  defeated, and a new lustre added to the reputation of the British
  arms.

  “That the Thanks of this House be given to the several officers,
  European and Native, under the command of Sir Henry Smith, for
  the distinguished services rendered by them at the battle of
  Aliwal.

  “That this House doth highly approve of and commend the
  intrepidity and exemplary discipline displayed by the
  non-commissioned officers and private soldiers, European and
  Native, on the 28th of January, 1846, in their attack on the
  enemy’s position, by which the Sikhs were completely routed and
  driven in confusion across the Sutlej, with the loss of all their
  artillery and military equipment; and that the same be signified
  to them by the Commanders of the several corps, who are desired
  to thank them for their gallant behaviour.

  “That in requesting the Governor-General of India to communicate
  these Resolutions to the several Officers referred to therein,
  this House desires to acknowledge the zeal and judgment evinced
  by the Right Honorable Lieut.-General Sir Henry Hardinge, Knight
  Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, Governor-General of India,
  and also by General Sir Hugh Gough, Baronet, Knight Grand Cross
  of the Order of the Bath, Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in
  India, in supplying Major-General Sir Henry Smith with such
  reinforcements and military means as enabled him, under Divine
  Providence, to overcome all the obstacles thrown in his way by a
  brave and determined enemy.

  “That the Thanks of this House be given to the Right Honorable
  Lieut.-General Sir Henry Hardinge, Knight Grand Cross of the Most
  Honorable Military Order of the Bath, Governor-General of India,
  for the judgment, energy, and ability with which the resources
  of the British Empire in India have been applied in repelling
  the unjust and unprovoked invasion of the British Territory by
  the Sikh Nation; and for the valour and indefatigable exertions
  which he displayed on the 10th of February, 1846, at the battle
  of Sobraon, when, by the blessing of Almighty God, which we
  desire most humbly to acknowledge, this hostile and treacherous
  invasion was successfully defeated.

  “That the Thanks of this House be given to General Sir Hugh
  Gough, Baronet, Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honorable Military
  Order of the Bath, Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in India,
  for the signal ability and valour with which, upon the 10th of
  February, 1846, he directed and led the attack, when the enemy’s
  intrenchments were stormed, their artillery captured, their army
  defeated and scattered, and the Punjaub laid open to the advance
  of our victorious troops.

  “That the Thanks of this House be given to Major-General Sir
  Henry George Smith, Knight Commander of the Most Honorable
  Military Order of the Bath; Major-General Walter Raleigh Gilbert;
  and Major-General Sir Joseph Thackwell, Knight Commander of the
  Most Honorable Military Order of the Bath; and to the other
  officers, European and Native, for the distinguished services
  rendered by them in the eminently successful operations at the
  battle of Sobraon.

  “That this House doth highly approve of and commend the
  invincible intrepidity, perseverance, and steady discipline
  displayed by the non-commissioned officers and private soldiers,
  European and Native, on the 10th of February, 1846, by which
  the glory of the British arms has been successfully maintained
  against a determined and greatly superior force, and that the
  same be signified to them by the Commanders of the several corps,
  who are desired to thank them for their gallant behaviour.

  “That the said Resolutions be transmitted by the Lord Chancellor
  to the Governor-General of India, and that he be requested to
  communicate the same to the several officers referred to therein.”


THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.

Votes of Thanks to the same effect were proposed by Sir Robert Peel
in the House of Commons, and carried without a dissenting voice.


THE EAST INDIA COMPANY.

On the same day, a Special General Court of the proprietors of
stock was held at the East India House, for the purpose of passing
a Vote of Thanks to Major-General Sir Henry Smith for his victory
at Aliwal over the Sikh army; to the Governor-General Sir Henry
Hardinge; to General Sir Hugh Gough, and to the European and Native
troops who were engaged in the war on the Sutlej. The resolutions
of the Court were proposed by Sir Henry Willock, the chairman, and
were unanimously adopted.


THE COURT OF COMMON COUNCIL OF LONDON.

At a Special Court of the Court of the Common Council of the
City of London, the Thanks and Congratulations of the Court were
awarded to Lieut.-General Sir Henry Hardinge, G.C.B., General Sir
Hugh Gough, G.C.B., and Major-General Sir Henry Smith, K.C.B.,
for the valour, judgment, and ability displayed by them in the
recent battles of Aliwal and Sobraon; also the Thanks of the Court
to the other officers, European and Native, for the intrepidity,
perseverance, and discipline evinced by them upon both these
memorable occasions.


After a tedious voyage down the Ganges, owing to the shallowness
of the river and the numerous sand-banks, the regiment did not
reach the station of Chinsurah until the 6th of July, on which day
it landed and marched into barracks. Chinsurah, formerly a Dutch
settlement, was ceded by Holland to the British Government in 1827;
it is situated on the right bank of the Ganges, about thirty miles
from Calcutta: the East India Company have built an excellent
barrack here for a regiment of infantry. The regiment was halted
here until the necessary preparations were made for its embarkation
for England.

On the 30th of July the arms of the regiment, which had been
proudly borne and successfully used on many occasions on the
battle-field, were given over to the ordnance department, and
deposited in the arsenal of Fort William.

On the arrival of the regiment at Fort William, the military
officers of the Presidency invited the officers of the sixteenth
lancers and THIRTY-FIRST regiment to a ball and supper at the
Town-hall, to show their high sense of the distinguished conduct
of those regiments in the field during the recent campaign on the
Sutlej.

The Lieut.-Governor, Sir Herbert Maddox, also invited the officers
to a splendid banquet at the Government House on the 1st of August.

The officers were also hospitably entertained by the officers of
the Bengal artillery stationed at Dum-Dum, the head-quarters of
that corps.

The entertainment given by the military officers at Calcutta to
the officers of the sixteenth lancers and THIRTY-FIRST regiment is
thus noticed in the public paper called the “Star,” of the 1st of
August, 1846:--

  “The ball given by the military to Her Majesty’s sixteenth
  lancers and Her Majesty’s THIRTY-FIRST regiment, came off
  with great brilliancy last night at the Town Hall; there were
  probably from 400 to 500 persons present. The hall was decorated
  with remarkable taste, and the honored Peninsular colours of
  the THIRTY-FIRST regiment hung in tatters under the principal
  canopy, blood-stained in the recent engagements, in all of which
  the gallant regiment was present. At the opposite end of the
  table was a large transparency of the battle of Sobraon. Colonel
  Warren presided at the supper-table; and Colonel Burlton, in an
  excellent speech, reviewing the services of the regiments from
  the commencement of the present century, gave the toast of the
  evening, which was acknowledged by Lieut.-Colonel MacDowell and
  Lieut.-Colonel Spence.”

Previous to the departure of the regiment from India, the
following General Order was issued by General Lord Gough, the
Commander-in-Chief:--

      “Head-Quarters, Simla, 23rd May, 1846.

  “Those distinguished regiments, the sixteenth lancers and the
  THIRTY-FIRST foot, are about to return to their native country
  after a service in India, the former of twenty-four, the latter
  of twenty-one years; and although the Commander-in-Chief has
  recently, and so frequently, had occasion to laud the gallant
  conduct of these corps before an intrepid enemy, he cannot
  permit them to embark without again expressing his admiration
  of their continued and conspicuous bravery in all the battles
  they have been engaged in during the long and eventful period
  of their Indian service, whether in Affghanistan, or at the more
  sanguinary conflicts of 1845 and 1846.

  “These brave regiments may be assured they will be received in
  their native land with every demonstration of that patriotic
  feeling which gallant exploits ensure from their countrymen.

  “The sixteenth lancers have added to their standards ‘Bhurtpore,
  Affghanistan, Ghuznee, Maharajpore, Aliwal, and Sobraon;’ and the
  THIRTY-FIRST regiment will have recorded on their already highly
  decorated colours--‘Cabool, Moodkee, Ferozeshah, Aliwal, and
  Sobraon.’

  “Again must Lord Gough express the gratification it affords him
  thus to be able to record his opinion of their merits; and both
  these corps are assured that their correct conduct in quarters,
  and almost total absence of crime for many years, have mainly
  conduced to the gallant achievements in the field to which their
  good fortune has afforded them the opportunity to contribute.

  “That every happiness and welfare may hereafter attend these
  regiments, is the Commander-in-Chief’s ardent desire, for he
  must ever feel the warmest interest in the career of such highly
  distinguished regiments.

  “The Commander-in-Chief congratulates the two officers,
  Lieut.-Colonel MacDowell, C.B., and Lieut.-Colonel Spence,
  who accompanied their regiments to India nearly a quarter of
  a century ago, upon now having the honor and gratification of
  commanding them, after such distinguished services, on their
  return to their native land. Lieut.-Colonel MacDowell has never
  left India since his first arrival.

      “By order of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief.

      (Signed)       “H. G. SMITH, Major-General,
      “Adjutant-General to the Forces in India.”

The regiment embarked for England, the left wing under the command
of Lieutenant Plaskett, on board the ‘Plantagenet,’ on the 2nd of
August, 1846, consisting of 5 officers, 12 serjeants, 4 drummers,
and 102 rank and file, 10 women and 10 children. The head-quarters,
or right wing, embarked on board the ‘Madagascar’ on the 3rd of
August, 1846, under the command of Major Staunton, and consisted
of 10 officers, 19 serjeants, 7 drummers, and 194 rank and file,
21 women, and 32 children. Unfortunately, as the ‘Plantagenet’ was
putting out to sea, she sprung a leak, and was obliged to return
to Calcutta with all speed, the pumps being worked night and day
by the soldiers, without whose assistance she must have gone
down: they succeeded in bringing her safe into dock, there being
then above seven feet of water in the hold. This detachment again
embarked in the same ship on the 29th of August, and arrived in
England on the 13th of January, 1847, having lost on the passage
seven men. The ‘Madagascar,’ with head-quarters, arrived in England
on the 5th of December, and lost on the passage Lieutenant Richard
Sparrow and five soldiers.

After a voyage of four months, the surviving veterans of the
regiment were gladdened with the sight of the shores of their
native land. The head-quarters of the regiment reached Gravesend on
the 4th of December, 1846; and on the 6th disembarked and marched
to Chatham. Nothing could exceed the enthusiasm of the public to
welcome the arrival of this distinguished corps.

The following description of the reception the regiment met with
on its arrival, is taken from the ‘Illustrated London News’ of
December, 1846:--

  “_The Return of the_ THIRTY-FIRST _Regiment from India_.--On the
  4th instant the head-quarters of this distinguished regiment
  arrived by the ship Madagascar from Calcutta, from which place
  they embarked on the 3rd of August last: they lost by deaths on
  the voyage five men and one officer, Lieut. Richard Sparrow.
  They brought home with them four captured colours, which they
  took in the short but brilliant campaign against the Sikhs.
  * * * On the evening of the 6th the head-quarters marched into
  Chatham garrison from Gravesend, by the Rochester and Gravesend
  Railway, where they were met by the very superior band of the
  royal marines. On the arrival at the Rochester terminus, the
  band struck up, ‘God save the Queen,’ and these heroes of the
  Sutlej were greeted by hundreds of people with loud and repeated
  huzzas. The soldiers, in return for this spirited welcome, waved
  the four colours captured from the enemy, one at Ferozeshah,
  one at Aliwal, and two taken at Sobraon. These banners bear
  testimony of the severe engagements. The Queen’s colour, and the
  regimental colour, are complete fragments. The head-quarters were
  also accompanied by the depôt band, which played at intervals in
  passing with the regiment through the streets of Rochester and
  Chatham, and were greeted along the whole line by thousands of
  people who assembled to witness their return.

  “Out of the 215 men landed from the Madagascar there are but 80
  unwounded. Lieut.-Colonel Spence, and Quarter-master Benison, are
  the only officers, now with the regiment, who went out with it in
  the ‘Kent’ East Indiaman, which took fire and sank in the Bay of
  Biscay.

  “The following officers have come home with the
  head-quarters:--Major George Staunton, Brevet Major D. F. G.
  Longworth, Lieut. G. Elmslie, Lieut. T. Scarman, Lieut. R.
  Mackenzie, Lieut. and Adjutant A. S. Bolton, Lieut. H. P. Hutton,
  Quarter-master S. Benison, and Assistant-Surgeon H. C. Foss.
  Total nine officers and 215 serjeants, drummers, and rank and
  file.

  “Lieut.-Colonel Spence headed the troops. The officers of this
  regiment, having been on the most friendly terms with the royal
  marine corps, and being members of the mess of the royal marines,
  they dined at the royal marines’ mess-room with the officers, who
  invited them on their arrival at the garrison to a superb repast.

  “The officers of the regiment were invited to dinner by Colonel
  Sir Frederick Smith and the officers of the royal engineers in
  garrison at Chatham. They also received invitations to dinner
  from the officers of the 2nd battalion of the 60th rifles, and
  also from the officers of the provisional battalion quartered in
  this garrison.”

Shortly after its arrival in England, the following complimentary
letter was received by Lieut.-Colonel Spence, commanding the
regiment, from that distinguished officer General Sir Colin
Halkett, G.C.B., the Colonel of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment:--

      “United Service Club, London, 22nd Dec., 1846.

  “MY DEAR COLONEL,

  “It is with the liveliest satisfaction that I avail myself of
  the arrival in England of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, under
  your command, to offer you, and the corps, my most sincere
  congratulations on your return to your native land, after your
  arduous and distinguished services in the East. Connected as I
  have the honor to be with the regiment, it was natural for me
  to take a deep interest in its welfare, and to follow its fate
  and fortunes with all the attention in my power; and as some
  professional experience enabled me to appreciate the toils you
  had to encounter, and the dangers you had to overcome, it was
  with highly gratified pride and most heartfelt delight, that I
  heard how nobly you had supported the first, and how gallantly
  you had vanquished the latter.

  “At the very outset of the voyage from England, the regiment
  was already called upon to give proofs of that high state of
  discipline, which is the soldier’s best shield in difficulties.
  On dark and distant seas, amid the flames of the unfortunate East
  India ship Kent, you remained firm and tranquil, obedient to
  orders issued by that meritorious soldier, your then commanding
  officer, Lieut.-Colonel Fearon (now Major-General), and thus
  ensured the safety of all when every semblance of hope seemed to
  have vanished, and when confusion must have led to inevitable
  destruction.

  “The promise, which such noble conduct gave, was fully justified
  by your subsequent behaviour. Called upon to aid in avenging
  disasters which the feebleness of allies had brought upon your
  country’s arms, you forced your way through the most difficult
  part of Central Asia, through mountain wildernesses unequalled
  on the face of the globe, and never traversed by disciplined
  troops since the days of the great Macedonian conqueror. Even
  the gallantry, which you displayed during this campaign, seems
  to be forgotten, when we reflect on the steady discipline, and
  dauntless energy, evinced in contending against the toils and
  difficulties which had to be overcome at every step of this
  memorable march, only eclipsed by the more brilliant actions you
  were soon afterwards called upon to perform.

  “An Army, composed of the most warlike tribes of Asia, trained
  to arms by European officers, long accustomed to victory under
  the sway of an able and ambitious prince, assuming, on the death
  of Runjeet Singh, the power of absolute control over its feeble
  government, resolved to invade the British provinces; which,
  protected by a disciplined army, ruled by a wise and paternal
  government, had long prospered in peace, and acquired a degree of
  wealth too well calculated to tempt the rapacity of such lawless
  bands.

  “To avoid every appearance of hostility, and preserve peace to
  the last, the British authorities had kept their forces at a
  distance from the frontier; and the enemy thus emboldened by
  forbearance, which was probably taken for timidity, crossed the
  Sutlej, and attacked our possessions without even a declaration
  of war. In this difficulty it was only by extraordinary exertion
  on the part of the troops, by toil and fortitude never surpassed,
  if ever equalled, that your comrades posted along the frontier
  could be saved from ruin, and an unprincipled foe checked in
  time to avert the greatest calamities.

  “The march from Umballa must ever be memorable in the annals of
  war. Under the burning sun of India, you supported, at duty’s
  call, an excess of toil and fatigue, which would have tried the
  hardiest and the best, even in the bracing atmosphere of our
  northern climate; and your victory of _Moodkee_ was actually
  achieved over bold, numerous, and well-prepared foes, after a
  march of twenty miles, performed under the rays of a vertical
  sun, through a waste and parched country, not affording even a
  drop of water to allay the scorching thirst occasioned by the
  clouds of dust raised from the burning soil; fought, and won in
  fact, after an excess of toil that would have overcome all but
  the first and foremost soldiers of their time.

  “A single defeat was not, however, to daunt the fierce and
  numerous foes with whom you had to contend; and hardly had
  you recovered from the fatigues of your long march and first
  victory, when you were called upon to storm an entrenched camp,
  defended by vastly superior numbers, and by a train of heavy
  and well-served artillery such as the East had never beheld. To
  assail works, under such circumstances, is one of the most trying
  and difficult operations of war; and when the strength of the
  position, and the fierce resolution with which it was defended,
  are considered, your victory may safely be termed an action of
  unsurpassed boldness, energy, and perseverance.

  “Never will your country’s banner suffer a stain, so long as
  its soldiers shall equal those who stormed the Sikh camp of
  _Ferozeshah_: greater fortitude and gallantry than those of
  which you had given proof in these actions could not possibly be
  displayed. But every species of high soldiership was to be called
  for during the course of this brief campaign, and it was your
  fortune to be present in the different actions, all fought under
  different circumstances.

  “At _Aliwal_ you had to execute on an open and level plain, and
  under a heavy fire of artillery, the skilful movements which
  ensured the success of that brilliant day; and at _Sobraon_ you
  were again called upon to force entrenchments, constructed with
  European science, and defended with all the fierce resolution
  of Asiatic despair. But neither savage valour, nor European
  art, could withstand your efforts,--could compete with high and
  matchless gallantry, regulated by discipline, and fired to noble
  exertion by the consciousness of what was due to your country’s
  name and fame!--The _Battle of Sobraon_, which crushed the power
  of unprincipled adversaries, terminated your exploits in the
  East, saved the British provinces from devastation, and secured
  to our youthful and beloved Sovereign the peaceful and happy
  possession of India! Never indeed were nobler objects attained by
  nobler conduct!

  “It is needless for me to tell you how greatly all ranks of your
  countrymen sympathised with your fortunes during these trying
  times; how much they felt for your sufferings; how deeply they
  mourned for the heavy losses you sustained; and how highly they
  exulted in the gallantry you displayed. The admiration your
  behaviour excited, must have reached you even on the distant
  shores of India; and I feel confident that every step you
  take on British ground will show how justly your conduct is
  appreciated by all those whose good opinion can be of value.
  It only remains for me, therefore, again to offer you my most
  sincere congratulations on your return to your native land, to
  wish you every success and happiness in your future progress, and
  to assure you, that as far as my sphere of action extends, no
  effort shall be wanting to give effect to the sentiments I feel
  such high satisfaction in now expressing.

      “Believe me,
      “My dear Colonel, ever yours sincerely,
      “COLIN HALKETT,
      “General, and Colonel Thirty-first Regt.

  “Lieut.-Colonel Spence, C.B., “Commanding Thirty-first Regiment.”

As an additional testimony of the consideration of the services
of the officers and men of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment who had
returned from India, His Grace the Commander-in-Chief was pleased
to authorize the following letter to be addressed to the officer
commanding, dated Horse Guards, 21st of December, 1846:--

  “Sir,

  “In transmitting the enclosed Copy of the General Order of the
  30th of October last, granting leave of absence to officers, and
  furloughs to non-commissioned officers and men, to the 10th of
  March next, I have it in command to intimate to you, that the
  Commander-in-Chief, duly considering the glorious and important
  services recently performed by the regiment under your command,
  as well as its protracted service abroad, has been pleased to
  direct that furloughs may be forthwith granted to such of the
  non-commissioned officers and men recently returned from India,
  without limitation as to numbers, as may be desirous of availing
  themselves of that indulgence, so as to enable them immediately
  to visit their friends; and that leave of absence may, in like
  manner, be extended to as large a portion of the officers as can
  be spared from the duties of the regiment.

      “I have, &c.
      (_Signed_)      “JOHN MACDONALD,
      “_Adjutant-General_.”


The usual directions were given by the Secretary at War for
reducing the establishment of the regiment, in order to assimilate
it to that of other regiments on home duty, from the 6th of
December, 1846.

After transferring to the Invalid Depôt the men selected for
discharge on account of wounds and other disabilities, and
incorporating the depôt with the other companies, the regiment was
removed from Chatham to Walmer, where it arrived on the 20th of
December, and was received at Deal and in the neighbouring parts,
with the same honors and marks of distinction as had been evinced
on its arrival in the garrison of Chatham.

[Sidenote: 1847]

The remainder of the regiment, consisting of five officers, viz.,
Lieutenants Plaskett, Law, Pilkington, and Noel, Assistant-Surgeon
Massey, and 111 men, arrived at Gravesend on the 13th of January,
1847, on board of the Plantagenet freight ship: the delay in their
arrival was occasioned by that vessel having sprung a leak, which
compelled her to put back to Calcutta. This division proceeded
from Chatham on the 20th of January, to join the head-quarters of
the regiment at Walmer.

On the 30th of June, 1847, the regiment was apprised by the
Adjutant-General, that her Majesty had been pleased to approve of
its bearing on the regimental colour and appointments the words
MOODKEE, FEROZESHAH, ALIWAL, and SOBRAON, in commemoration of the
distinguished conduct evinced by the THIRTY-FIRST at those battles.

Lieut.-General the Honorable Henry Otway Trevor was appointed to
the colonelcy of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment on the 12th of July,
1847, in succession to General Sir Colin Halkett, G.C.B., who was
removed to the forty-fifth regiment.

On the 6th of September, 1847, Lieut.-General Sir Henry Smith
came to Walmer to see the regiment, before he proceeded to the
Cape of Good Hope, of which colony he had been appointed Governor
and Commander-in-Chief. On the 7th of September he reviewed the
regiment, and expressed his satisfaction at seeing its discipline
so perfect, considering that only a few months had elapsed since it
returned home a mere skeleton.

The regiment was inspected by Major-General Brown on the 4th of
May, and on the 1st of October, 1847; it was inspected on the 10th
of November, by His Grace the Duke of Wellington, who expressed
his approbation in the highest terms. In November the regiment was
removed to Manchester by railway in three divisions, where it was
completed to its establishment of 39 officers, 47 serjeants, 40
corporals, 17 drummers, and 760 privates.

[Sidenote: 1848]

On the 7th of April, 1848, the regiment proceeded to Ireland,
and arrived at Dublin on the following day. In July the regiment
marched to Athlone.

New Colours were presented to the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, on the
19th of May, 1848, by Major-General His Royal Highness the Prince
George of Cambridge, K.G., and the following account of the
ceremony was given in “_Saunders’ News-Letter_” of the following
day:--

  “The interesting military ceremonial of the presentation of
  New Colours to this gallant and distinguished corps took place
  yesterday, in the ornamental grounds in front of that fine
  building, the Queen’s Inns, Henrietta-street, Dublin. The
  regiment was formed in full review order at three o’clock,
  shortly after which His Royal Highness Prince George of
  Cambridge, accompanied by his aide-de-camp Captain the Honorable
  James Macdonald, Major-General John M‘Donald, and several other
  officers of distinction, came upon the ground.

  “In front of the line were four standards, captured by the
  regiment from the Sikhs, one of them taken at _Ferozeshah_, one
  at _Aliwal_, and two at _Sobraon_. The Colours of the Corps,
  torn to pieces from the grape-shot through which they were led
  to victory, and stained with the blood of the Ensigns who were
  killed carrying them to the muzzles of the Sikh guns, were
  objects of great interest to the numerous citizens who thronged
  the grounds. Lieut.-Colonel Spence, C.B., who commanded the
  gallant regiment in all these actions, except Sobraon (where he
  commanded the first brigade of Sir Henry Smith’s Division), was
  in command, and looked in admirable health and spirits.

  “The survivors of the Indian campaigns were decorated with their
  medals. After the usual routine of parading the old colours, and
  giving them up, the band playing ‘_Auld lang syne_,’ the Regiment
  formed a hollow square, and the Garrison Chaplain repeated the
  prescribed formula for the occasion. The New Colours were then
  handed to Ensigns Christian and Brown, when His Royal Highness
  the Prince George of Cambridge briefly addressed the Regiment,
  stating his gratification at having this pleasing duty to
  perform. He had not seen service himself, and the task would have
  fallen more appropriately upon one who had. In encouraging the
  troops to the performance of their duty, he related the anecdote
  of the Serjeant who, when the Ensign bearing the old colour had
  fallen mortally wounded, seized it,--carried it onwards,--and
  victory resulted. The non-commissioned officer was promoted to an
  ensigncy in the Eighteenth, Royal Irish, regiment.[36]

  “The corps then formed in line, and gave a Royal salute, the band
  playing ‘_God save the Queen_.’ The day was remarkably fine, and
  after the ceremony the regiment marched into its quarters in the
  Linen-Hall Barracks.”

Certain of the distinguished officers of the garrison of Dublin
were entertained by the officers of the regiment at dinner in the
evening; but His Royal Highness Prince George was prevented from
attending by an expected disturbance in the city.

[Sidenote: 1849]

On the 1st of February, 1849, the establishment of the regiment
was reduced from eight hundred to seven hundred and fifty rank and
file.

On the 20th of July, 1849, Lieut.-Colonel Spence retired, after a
lengthened service of forty-one years, and Major George Staunton
was promoted to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment, in succession to Lieut.-Colonel James Spence.[37]

During the year 1849 the regiment remained at Athlone.

[Sidenote: 1850]

In April, 1850, the regiment proceeded from Athlone to Dublin,
where it continued to be stationed at the conclusion of the
Historical Record.

[7] Minorca, an island in the Mediterranean, on the eastern coast
of Spain, is about thirty miles in length and twelve in breadth,
and is chiefly valuable for the excellent harbour of Port Mahon.
In September, 1708, Minorca was taken by Admiral Leake and a
land force under Lieut.-General Stanhope, after a siege of about
three weeks. The island was ceded to Great Britain by the treaty
of Utrecht, and remained in its possession until 1756, when, in
April of that year, it was besieged by the French, under Marshal
the Duke de Richelieu. After a brave defence by the Governor,
General Blakeney, the garrison, consisting of the 4th, 23rd, 24th,
and 34th regiments, surrendered, and, in consideration of their
gallantry, were permitted to march out with all the honors of war.
At the peace of Fontainebleau, in 1763, Minorca was restored to
the English in exchange for Belle-Isle. In February, 1782, the
garrison, under the Governor, Lieut.-General the Honorable James
Murray, after suffering severely from sickness, surrendered to the
Duke de Crillon, the Commander-in-Chief of the combined French and
Spanish forces, and Minorca was retained by Spain at the peace of
1783. Minorca again surrendered to a British force under General
the Honorable Charles Stuart, on the 15th of November, 1798; and
at the peace of Amiens, in 1802, Minorca was restored to the
Spaniards, under whose sway it remains at the present period.

[8] The nature of the services on which the _Marine Corps_ were
employed has since obtained for them the Royal authority to bear
the motto, “_Per mare, per terram_.”

[9] “On the morning of Sunday, the 10th of June, 1688, a day long
kept sacred by the too faithful adherents of a bad cause, was born
James Francis Edward Stuart, the most unfortunate of princes,
destined to seventy-seven years of exile and wandering,--of vain
projects,--of honours more galling than insults,--and of hopes
such as make the heart sick.”--‘History of England,’ by _Thomas
Babington Macaulay_. Vol. ii. page 363.

[10] _James Francis Edward_, “_The Pretender_,” son of _James II._,
and of _Mary_, daughter of the Duke of Modena, his second wife; was
born on the 10th June, 1688. He married, in 1719, Mary Clementina,
daughter of Prince James Sobieski, and granddaughter of John
Sobieski, King of Poland. He died on the 1st June, 1766 (aged 78
years), leaving issue two sons:--

1. _Charles Edward Louis Cassimir_, termed in England “_The Young
Pretender_;” born on the 30th November, 1720, who married the
Princess Stohlberg of Germany, and died at Rome, without issue, on
the 31st January, 1788.

2. _Henry Benedict_, called _The Cardinal York_; born on the 24th
March, 1725. When the last grand effort for the restoration of his
family, in 1745, proved abortive, he took holy orders, and was
elevated to the Purple by Pope Benedict XIV. in 1747, and died at
Rome in 1807. The Cardinal was the last male branch of the House of
Stuart.

[11] From the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht, in April, 1718,
until 1739, the only events that appeared at times to threaten
the _general_ tranquillity of Europe which prevailed during the
above period, arose from the Rebellion in Scotland, in favour of
the Pretender, in 1715, which was suppressed by the Battle of
_Sheriffmuir_, on the 13th of November of that year. Charles XII.,
of Sweden, also espoused the cause of the Pretender in 1717, but
the death of King Charles, in the following year, put an end to
the projected expedition to Great Britain. In 1719 Spain supported
the Pretender with troops, which were, however, defeated at
_Glenshiel_, on the 10th of June, 1719. This was followed by the
British expedition against Spain, but in January, 1720, the Spanish
Monarch accepted the conditions of Peace. In 1726 Spain made an
unsuccessful attempt to recover _Gibraltar_, and in 1729 a treaty
of Peace was concluded at Seville, which remained unbroken for the
ten following years.

[12] The “_Pragmatic Sanction_” was published by the Emperor
Charles VI. on the 17th of April, 1713, whereby, in case of
his having no male issue, his daughters were to succeed to his
hereditary dominions, in preference to the sons of his late
brother, Joseph I.

[13] See list of British regiments which served in Flanders and
Germany between 1742 and 1748, during the “_War of the Austrian
Succession_.”--Appendix, page 224.

[14] The following tradition has been preserved in the
regiment:--The facings and breeches of the THIRTY-FIRST being of
the same colour as those worn by the _Third “Buffs,”_ King George
II. mistook it for the latter regiment, and called out “_Bravo,
Buffs_,” with a view of animating the men to further gallantry;
and when reminded that it was the THIRTY-FIRST, and not the “Old
Buffs,” His Majesty then rejoined, “_Bravo, Young Buffs_;” and this
name, valuable for the time and manner of its being conferred, has
been since retained by the Regiment.

[15] Although the results of the _Battle of Dettingen_, fought
on the 27th of June, 1743, were not equal to those attending the
victories gained over the French by Edward the Third and Henry
the Fifth, yet there are circumstances which render the conflict
at _Dettingen_ similar to those of _Creçy_ and _Agincourt_. At
_Creçy_, on the 26th of August, 1346, King _Edward the Third_ and
his son _Edward the Black Prince_ were present; and at _Dettingen_,
_King George the Second_ was accompanied by his son the _Duke of
Cumberland_. It was the _début_ of both the Royal Princes on the
tented plain, and the chivalrous bearing of the _Black Prince_,
particularly his behaviour to the prisoners, finds a parallel
in the conduct of the _Duke of Cumberland_, who refused to have
his wound attended to, until the surgeons had examined that of a
French officer, the Count De Fenelon, who had been taken prisoner
and conveyed to the Duke’s tent. “Begin,” said His Royal Highness,
“with the wound of the French officer; he is more dangerously hurt
than I am, and stands more in need of assistance.”

The disadvantage under which the British fought at _Dettingen_ was
equal to that at _Agincourt_, and the impetuosity of the enemy, in
both instances, prevented the English army perishing from want of
provisions.

All these battles are likewise noted for the number of the French
Royal family and nobility who were present; and the battle of
Dettingen is further remarkable as being the last action in which a
British Monarch commanded the army.

The want of provisions and tents, unfortunately, compelled the
victors to abandon the field of battle, otherwise Dettingen might
have rivalled many of the achievements recorded in British History.

[16] “The Dutch, in their flight, breaking in on the _English_
ranks, were fired upon by those troops, which did them considerable
damage; a _Highlander_ in Lord Semphill’s (forty-second) regiment
being asked ‘Why he fired upon them; they were his friends?’
replied, ‘I am sure they are the greatest enemy we have seen this
day.’”--_Biggs’s Military History of Europe from 1739 to 1748._

[24] While stationed at Jersey, a soldier of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment displayed the following example of courage and presence
of mind:--On the 4th of June, 1804, a salute had been fired in
honor of the anniversary of the birthday of King George III. The
bombardier, whose duty it was to deposit the slow match in the
magazine on the Town Hill at St. Heliers, after the performance of
the ceremony, neglected to observe whether it was extinguished;
it unfortunately was still alight, and set fire to the building;
there were within the place three hundred and twenty-five barrels
of powder, and, from its central situation, an explosion would
have destroyed the greater portion of the town. Private William
Pentenny, of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, assisted by two inhabitants
of Jersey, broke open the magazine, when another moment’s delay
would probably have been too late, the fire having nearly reached
the spot where the powder was deposited, when he entered. With
infinite coolness and decision, he carried the nearest barrels
away in his arms, and continued so to act until the whole stock
was removed out of danger. This important service was highly
appreciated. The Patriotic Fund at Lloyd’s awarded Private William
Pentenny a pension of 20_l._ a year, while the states of Jersey
conferred an additional 12_l._ upon this deserving soldier, and
presented to him a gold medal, struck on purpose to commemorate
the achievement, which he was permitted to wear. The Governor,
Major-General the Honorable William Stewart, ordered a ring of
silver lace to be worn round his arm as a further distinction.

[25] This extract is from an excellent pamphlet published in
Edinburgh soon after the event, by a “_Passenger_.” It was written
by Major Duncan M‘Gregor of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, who was
afterwards the Lieutenant-Colonel of the ninety-third Highlanders.

[26] General Avitabile, one of the military instructors of the
Sikhs, was a native of Italy, and at the conclusion of Napoleon’s
bright, but evanescent career, sought employment in the East. He
was handsomely rewarded by the Sovereign of the Punjaub, Runjeet
Singh, together with another Italian officer, named Ventura,
and two Frenchmen, Allard and Court, for introducing European
tactics into the Sikh army. Runjeet Singh also conferred the
governorship of Peshawur upon General Avitabile, and by his
vigorous administration it was reduced from a state of anarchy to
one of comparative security. Peshawur signifies “_advanced post_,”
that name having been conferred upon it by its founder, the Mogul
Emperor Akbar, in consequence of its being the frontier town of
India towards Affghanistan.

Runjeet Singh died in 1839, and his son and successor, Kurruck
Singh, being of weak intellect, was shortly afterwards deposed,
when his son, Noo Nehal Singh, assumed the reins of Government.
His death, which occurred in returning from his father’s funeral,
caused the throne to be again vacant, and the crown was bestowed on
Prince Shere Singh, a twin-son of Runjeet Singh. Shere Singh was a
firm friend to the English, and by his interference Major-General
Pollock was permitted to proceed with his army through the Punjaub
to Cabool in 1842, although the Sikh Sirdars were disposed to
attack the British troops.

[27] Vide Memoir of Lieut.-Colonel Skinner, Appendix, p. 226.

[28] The Punjaub derives its name from two Persian words (_punj_,
five, and _aub_ waters), signifying _five waters_. In fact there
are _six_ rivers intersecting the country, namely the _Indus_,
_Jhelum_, _Chenaub_, _Ravee_, _Beas_, and _Sutlej_. The course of
the _Beas_ is much shorter than the five other rivers, so that it
appears to have been disregarded when the name of the Punjaub was
bestowed.

[29] On the death of Assistant-Surgeon Gahan, Assistant-Surgeon
Patrick Gammie, of the 80th regiment, was appointed to take medical
charge of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment.

[30] Vide Memoir of Colonel Bolton, inserted in Appendix, page 225.

[31] Vide Memoir of Major Baldwin, inserted in Appendix, page 230.

[32] Shortly after the storming of the village of _Aliwal_, an
European officer in the Sikh service was given in charge to the
regiment, having surrendered himself as a prisoner to an officer
of one of the cavalry regiments in the Company’s service. He said
his servant had galloped off with his charger, and, being rather
stout, preferred giving himself up to the chance of running away;
his name was John Potter, a native of Maidstone in Kent; he had
deserted from the Company’s Artillery twenty years before, and was
at this period a Colonel of Artillery in the Sikh service, having
a native wife and family at Lahore. At first he was kept a very
strict prisoner, but the severity of his confinement was gradually
relaxed, and when the army encamped before Lahore, he was released
altogether. The Governor-General afterwards permitted him to hold
an appointment in the Sikh service.

[33] This officer was promoted from Quarter-master-Serjeant to
Ensign after the battle of Ferozeshah.

[34] This part of the action is represented in the engraving of the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment at the battle of Sobraon.

[35] In some copies of this General Order it was erroneously stated
that Brigadier Hicks commanded the first brigade: he was not at the
battle of Sobraon.

[36] Vide pages 146 and 165 of Regimental Record.

[37] A beautiful silver inkstand has been recently presented
to Lieut.-Colonel Spence, by the Officers of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment. It is an elegant testimonial, and is tastefully
embellished with military trophies, a soldier of the regiment being
introduced on the two extremities, in the position to receive
cavalry,--the whole surmounted by the British Lion. The following
inscription is engraved on the testimonial:--

  Presented to

  LIEUTENANT-COLONEL SPENCE, C.B.,

  By Lieutenant-Colonel Staunton and Officers of the THIRTY-FIRST
        Regiment,
  As a token of their esteem and attachment,
  On his leaving the Regiment, in which he had served for a period of
        forty-one years,
  With high distinction to himself and honor to his Country.




HISTORICAL RECORD

OF THE

SECOND BATTALION

OF THE

THIRTY-FIRST, OR THE HUNTINGDONSHIRE

REGIMENT OF FOOT.


[Sidenote: 1804]

Napoleon Bonaparte, upon being raised in May 1804 to the dignity
of Emperor of the French, increased his immense preparations to
carry into effect his project for the invasion of England, that
he might, by one great effort, crush the power of the British
people, who appeared as a barrier to his ambitious designs. This
menace of invasion had aroused the spirit of the British nation;
patriotic enthusiasm pervaded all ranks; and among the measures of
defence[38] adopted by the Government was the introduction of the
“_Additional Force Act_” which was passed on the 14th of July 1804.

[Sidenote: 1805]

Under this Act of Parliament, a _second battalion_ was added to the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment, which was to be formed of men raised in the
county of Chester for limited service.

The second battalion was embodied by July 1805, and in October it
proceeded from Chester to Winchester, where the first battalion was
stationed.

[Sidenote: 1806]

After the first battalion had embarked for Sicily in April 1806,
the second battalion continued at Winchester until June following,
when it proceeded to Gosport.

[Sidenote: 1807]

On the 8th of January 1807, the second battalion embarked at
Gosport for Guernsey, where it arrived on the 15th of that month.
In May 1807, the battalion proceeded to Ireland, and was stationed
at Limerick.

[Sidenote: 1808]

In March 1808, the battalion was removed from Limerick to Dublin.

Important events had in the meantime occurred on the Continent,
which occasioned the second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment
to be ordered on active service. Napoleon, having reduced Germany
to submission to his will, and forced Russia to accede to his
decrees, next attempted the subjugation of Spain and Portugal. The
Spaniards and Portuguese rose in arms to assert their national
rights, the French Emperor having conferred the crown of Spain on
his brother Joseph, who relinquished the throne of Naples in favor
of Marshal Murat.

In the summer of 1808, Portugal was delivered by a British army
under Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley; and in the autumn
Lieut.-General Sir John Moore received orders to advance with a
body of British troops from Portugal into the heart of Spain; at
the same time several regiments were embarked from the United
Kingdom to co-operate in the enterprise.

The second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST, which had proceeded in
August to Fermoy, marched on the 8th of September to Monkstown for
embarkation, and sailed in a few days afterwards to Falmouth, where
a fleet was assembling with a force for service, the command of the
troops being held by Lieut.-General Sir David Baird. In a short
time, the fleet sailed, and arrived in the Bay of Corunna on the
23rd of October. The THIRTY-FIRST did not, however, land with the
army, the battalion being despatched to Lisbon, where it arrived on
the 5th of November.

Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock, who commanded in Portugal at
this period, detached some regiments towards the frontier, with a
view of reinforcing Lieut.-General Sir John Moore in Spain. The
THIRTY-FIRST, being one of the corps destined for this service,
marched with a force under the command of Brigadier-General Richard
Stewart from Lisbon, on the 18th of December, upon Castello Branco,
where the battalion arrived in ten days.

The communication with Lieut.-General Sir John Moore being at this
period suddenly interrupted, Brigadier-General Stewart was ordered
to halt, and unfavourable intelligence being received from Spain,
Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock determined to concentrate his army
near Lisbon, and the further advance was, therefore, countermanded.

[Sidenote: 1809]

The second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST, and the other corps of
the division, commenced their march to the rear on the 1st of
January 1809. On arrival at Santarem, the intelligence of Sir
John Moore’s advance upon Sahagun had reached head-quarters, and
the anticipated danger being thus drawn from the frontiers of
Portugal, Brigadier-General Stewart was again ordered to halt. His
head-quarters continued at Santarem, and the THIRTY-FIRST occupied
cantonments in the neighbourhood of Bucellas. A month’s march in
incessant rain had seriously damaged the appointments, and the men
being indifferently provided with shoes, rendered a rest in this
pleasant quarter of infinite benefit.

In the meanwhile, the army under Lieut.-General Sir John Moore
had continued its retreat over two hundred and fifty miles of
mountainous country, constantly repulsing the attacks of the enemy.
The British army arrived at Corunna on the 11th of January, being
closely followed by Marshal Soult, who occupied a position on a
height above the town, in order to make an attack on the troops
while proceeding to embark. This operation commenced on the 16th
of January, and the French descending from the heights in three
columns, a sanguinary action ensued. Lieut.-General Sir John
Moore received a mortal wound from a cannon-ball, and his country
was deprived of an officer, who, both in his professional and
private character, had acquired universal esteem and admiration.
Lieut.-General Sir David Baird lost an arm, and the command
devolved on Lieut.-General Sir John Hope, who vigorously maintained
the action, the British remaining masters of the field. The
embarkation for England was effected on the following night, no
further molestation being offered by the enemy.

No change was made in the disposition of the army in Portugal
until the middle of March, when Lieut.-General Sherbrooke, and
Major-General John Randoll McKenzie, with their corps arrived.
The army was then drawn together between Lumiar and Sacavem, in
which position it encamped until toward the end of April, when
Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock commenced his advance towards Spain
on the 24th of that month; and when Lieut.-General Sir Arthur
Wellesley, who had arrived at Lisbon with reinforcements, assumed
the command of the army, the force was assembled at Leiria. The
first object of Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley was to dislodge
Marshal Soult from Oporto, and he accordingly marched towards that
city at the end of April.

A corps of British and Portuguese was detached, previous to Sir
Arthur Wellesley’s march upon Oporto, under Major-General McKenzie,
to watch the right bank of the Tagus in observation of Marshal
Victor in Estremadura. The second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST
joined this army, and remained posted at Thomar until after the
famous passage of the Douro by the British General, and the fall of
Oporto, which compelled Marshal Soult to retreat.

In the month of June the second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST was
at Cortiçada with Major-General McKenzie’s head-quarters, and in
that officer’s division reached Placentia, whence on the 17th of
July it commenced its march to Oropesa, where it arrived on the
20th. A junction with the Spanish army under General Cuesta was
effected here, and on the 22nd the advanced guards, to which the
THIRTY-FIRST belonged, moved forward to the attack on the French
posts at _Talavera_. The enemy’s position was turned by the British
cavalry and infantry, while the Spanish General drove the French
on in front. On the 25th, in consequence of General Cuesta having
followed the enemy, two divisions of infantry were sent across the
Alberche to Casa Legas. The second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST
was in that commanded by Major-General McKenzie, and was brigaded
with the twenty-eighth and forty-fifth regiments.

On the 27th of July, when General Cuesta had retreated from
Alcabon under cover of Lieut.-General Sherbrooke’s divisions,
Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley withdrew to the position of
_Talavera_, leaving Major-General McKenzie on the Alberche to
protect the movement. When the French, on the 27th of July, crossed
this river, Major-General McKenzie’s division was posted near the
Casa des Salinas, his infantry in the forest, and cavalry on the
plain.

The attach was somewhat sudden, and the THIRTY-FIRST and
eighty-seventh regiments, which were in the wood on the right of
the Alberche, sustained some loss. As the enemy increased his
numbers on the British side of the river, Major-General McKenzie
fell back gradually, and entering the position by the left of the
combined army, took up his ground in a second line, in rear of the
foot guards. In the dusk of the evening the enemy commenced his
attack on the British left, but failed; in the night the attack was
repeated, and on the morning of the 28th of July the French renewed
the attack on the height on the British left, and were again
repulsed with considerable loss. After a pause of some hours the
attacks were renewed upon the whole British front, and the action
became general. Brigadier-General Alexander Campbell’s division,
on the British right, sustained the assault of the enemy’s fourth
corps, assisted by Major-General McKenzie’s brigade. “The English
regiments, putting the French skirmishers aside, met the advancing
columns with loud shouts, and breaking in on their front, and
lapping their flanks with fire, and giving no respite, pushed them
back with a terrible carnage. Ten guns were taken; but as General
Campbell prudently forbore pursuit, the French rallied on their
supports, and made a show of attacking again: vain attempt! The
British artillery and musketry played too vehemently upon their
masses, and a Spanish regiment of cavalry charging on their flank
at the same time, the whole retired in disorder, and the victory
was secured in that quarter.”[39]

The ten captured guns remained in possession of the
British;--Major-General John Randoll McKenzie was killed;--and the
second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, under Major John
Williams Watson, conducted itself in such a manner as to merit
notice in the despatch, as well as approbation in General Orders.
Major Watson received a medal, and was afterwards promoted to the
rank of Lieutenant-Colonel for his conduct on this occasion.

The THIRTY-FIRST, in the actions of the 27th and 28th of July,
had Captain William Lodge, two serjeants, and forty-two rank and
file _killed_; Captains Nicolls and Coleman,--Lieutenants George
Beamish, Adderley Beamish, and Girdlestone,--Ensigns Gamble and
Soden,--Assistant-Surgeon Edwards,--eight serjeants, and one
hundred and eighty-two rank and file, _wounded_. Most of the
wounded fell into the hands of the French, on the abandonment of
Talavera afterwards by the Spanish General. Assistant-Surgeon
Edwards, who was left in charge of the wounded, died shortly
afterwards.

The news of the brilliant victory of _Talavera_, gained over the
French army commanded by Joseph Bonaparte in person, excited
great joy in England, and Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley was
raised to the peerage by the title of Viscount Wellington. The
Royal Authority was afterwards given for the THIRTY-FIRST to bear
the word “TALAVERA” on the Regimental Colour and Appointments, to
commemorate the distinguished conduct of the second battalion on
that memorable occasion.

After the battle of the 28th of July, the second battalion was
posted to Major-General Tilson’s brigade, in the division commanded
by Major-General Rowland (afterwards Viscount) Hill; and on the 3rd
of August marched from Talavera, in order to oppose the French, who
had entered Estremadura by Placentia.

On the 3rd of September, the head-quarters arrived at Badajoz,
and the army was distributed about Elvas, Campo Mayor, and other
places, the THIRTY-FIRST being in the division cantoned at Montejo.
The troops had suffered greatly on the march from Talavera,
generally from dysentery, brought on by bad food, fatigue, and
exposure. When the second battalion had rested awhile in its
position, the sickness that had been kept off in a great measure
by the previous excitement, now visited the men severely, and a
considerable number died.

[Sidenote: 1810]

When Viscount Wellington broke up from the Guadiana in the month
of December, and crossed the Tagus, he left Lieut.-General Hill,
who had been appointed to serve on the Staff in the Peninsula as
a Lieut.-General, after the battle of _Talavera_, with a force of
ten thousand men, British and Portuguese, at Abrantes. Among the
former was the second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST; it continued
at that place until February 1810, when Lieut.-General Hill, on the
approach of Marshal Mortier on Badajoz, marched to Portalegre, and
occupied that strong position. He made a move on the 23rd of April
through the Sierra de St. Marmede, which had the desired effect of
relieving General O’Donnell at Albuquerque, the enemy retiring to
Merida. Lieut.-General Hill was once more at Portalegre on the 26th
of April, and on the 15th of May he again quitted his cantonment,
by which movement he disengaged Badajoz from the attention of the
enemy, who had made a reconnoisance on the 12th of that place, and
relieved General Ballasteros, returning in a few days afterwards to
his old position.

During the continuance of the division at Portalegre, it was always
on the alert, owing to General Regnier’s movements in Estremadura.
In the beginning of July, Lieut.-General Hill concentrated his
corps at Campo Mayor, previously to an expedition into Estremadura
in conjunction with the Marquis de Romana. General Regnier had,
however, frustrated this plan, by quitting Merida on the 10th of
July, and marching upon Aleonete and Almaraz, effected the passage
of the Tagus on the 16th. Lieut.-General Hill made a parallel
movement, and crossing the river at Vilha Velha, was at Castello
Branco on the 21st; he encamped at Sarzedas, in front of the
Sobreira Formosa, remaining some time in observation between the
Estrella and the Tagus.

Upon Marshal Massena concentrating his force for the invasion
of Portugal, Lieut.-General Hill fell back from his position at
Sarzedas, and on the 21 st of August, arrived on the Alva. On the
26th, the THIRTY-FIRST in Lieut.-General Hill’s corps, crossed the
Mondego, arrived on the _Sierra de Busaco_, and was posted on the
right, across the road leading over the mountain ridge to Peña
Cova, but the battalion was not engaged in the action.

When General Regnier attacked the position held by the third and
fifth divisions, Lieut.-General Hill withdrew towards his left to
support them; it was unnecessary however, these divisions having
repulsed the enemy, and he therefore continued in his original
position.

After the battle of Busaco, fought on the 27th of September, the
army withdrew from the Sierra, and Lieut.-General Hill’s division
marched on Thomar, arriving there on the 4th of October; whence
continuing its retreat by Santarem, it took up its ground, on the
8th, on the right of the Torres Vedras lines at Alhandra, on the
right of the Tagus, in which position the second battalion of
the THIRTY-FIRST had several skirmishes with the enemy, without
sustaining much loss. The battalion remained at Alhandra, opposite
which was the second French corps under General Regnier.

On the 17th of November, the second division crossed the Tagus
at Villada upon Abrantes, where the French were in retreat. Upon
Marshal Massena taking up a position at Santarem, it halted at
Chamako, where the head-quarters were stationed; the troops being
so distributed as to have an eye to the enemy, and prevent his
crossing to the south of the Tagus. Lieut.-General Hill returned
to England on account of ill health in December, and Marshal Sir
William Carr (now Viscount) Beresford succeeded him in the command
of his division, which amounted to fourteen thousand men, British
and Portuguese.

[Sidenote: 1811]

The hostile armies remained in the same positions until the
beginning of March, when Marshal Massena broke up from Santarem,
and Major-General the Honorable William Stewart, with a body of
troops, of which the THIRTY-FIRST formed part, crossed the Tagus at
Abrantes, and moved to Thomar, while Marshal Beresford remained at
Barla, and did not join in the pursuit of Marshal Massena.

Towards the end of March, Sir William Beresford arrived at
Portalegre with twenty thousand infantry, two thousand cavalry,
and eighteen guns, with orders to relieve Campo Mayor, and besiege
_Olivenza_ and _Badajoz_. The first object was effected on the
25th of March; it was an affair of cavalry only. On the 6th of
April, the passage of the Guadiana took place at Jurumenha, and
the army occupied a position on a strong range of hills. On the
9th of April, _Olivenza_ was summoned, and not surrendering the
army encamped round it. General Latour Maubourg having retired
to Llerena, Marshal Beresford leaving the fourth division, with
Colonel Madden’s cavalry, opposite Olivenza, took post on the 11th
at _Albuhera_, the infantry being on the 16th drawn nearer to
_Badajoz_, which place was invested on the 8th of May.

On the 8th and 10th of May, the French made two sorties, but were
driven back with considerable loss. Marshal Soult’s approach to
relieve Badajoz having been ascertained, the siege was raised on
the night of the 12th, and moving to _Albuhera_, the British were
in position on the 15th of May.

The second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST was on the left of
Lieut.-Colonel Colborne’s brigade, in the division under
Major-General the Honorable William Stewart, which was drawn up,
in one line, behind the village of _Albuhera_; its right on a
commanding hill, over which the Valverde road passed; its left on
the road to Badajoz.

On the morning of the 16th of May, the grand attack was made by
the French on the right of the position, and in a line at right
angles to it: this point was contested by the Spaniards without
success,--they gave way, and the French columns pushing on, seized
the crown of the hill, and bringing up their reserves, established
their batteries in position on it. At this moment Major-General the
Honorable William Stewart brought forward Lieut.-Colonel Colborne’s
brigade, and arrived with it at the foot of the hill, while all
was in confusion above. The Major-General rushed on in open column
of companies, attempting to form his line in succession as the
battalions arrived. The THIRTY-FIRST, the left of the brigade, was
still in column, when four regiments of hussars and lancers, which
had been concealed by the heavy rain falling at the time, passed by
the right flank to the rear of the line.

“_One battalion only_ (_the_ THIRTY-FIRST) _being still in column,
escaped the storm, and maintained its ground, while the French
horsemen, riding violently over everything else, penetrated to all
parts._”[40]

Major-General the Honorable William Lumley sent some squadrons of
cavalry to take the attention of the Lancers, but the THIRTY-FIRST
continued to hold the height, while the Spaniards would not
advance, and Marshal Soult still kept his columns together on the
point he had assailed. Major-General Hoghton’s brigade coming up
in good order, under Major-General the Honorable William Stewart,
and being soon afterwards reinforced by a portion of the fourth
division, relieved the second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST from
the difficulty of its position.

The THIRTY-FIRST had two serjeants and twenty-six rank and file
_killed_; and Captains Fleming and Knox, Lieutenants Butler,
Gethen, and Bolton; Ensigns Wilson and Nicholson; four serjeants,
and one hundred and sixteen rank and file, _wounded_.

Major George Guy Carleton L’Estrange, who commanded the
battalion, at the battle of _Albuhera_, was promoted to the rank
of Lieut.-Colonel in the army for his conduct on that day, and
received a medal. Viscount Wellington alluded to his gallantry in
the following terms:--

“There is one officer, Major L’Estrange, of the THIRTY-FIRST, whom
I must recommend, in the strongest manner, for promotion in some
way or other. _After the other parts of the same brigade were swept
off by the Cavalry, this little battalion alone held its ground
against all the ‘colonnes en masse.’_”

Captain Peter Fearon, of the THIRTY-FIRST, distinguished himself on
the same day in command of the Lusitanian legion, and received a
medal for his conduct.

The Royal Authority was afterwards given for the THIRTY-FIRST to
bear the word “ALBUHERA” on the regimental colour and appointments,
to commemorate the distinguished conduct of the second battalion on
that memorable occasion.

The army was again in position during the 17th of May, the enemy
appearing to meditate another attack; the remainder of the fourth
division, however, arrived by forced marches from Jurumenha, and on
the 18th Marshal Soult retreated, followed by Marshal Beresford,
who left the Portuguese to make a show of investing Badajoz. The
infantry had no affair with the enemy during his retreat; and when
he assumed a position at Llerena, the operations terminated.

Major-General Hill at this period rejoined from England, and the
second siege of _Badajoz_ commenced on the 30th of May.

The second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST continued under
Lieut.-General Hill, to which rank he was promoted on the 4th of
June 1811, in the covering army, which was posted between Merida
and Albuhera. Having been much reduced in the late action, it
was formed, with the sixty-sixth regiment, into a Provisional
Battalion, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Colborne.

When Marshal Soult advanced, and the siege of Badajoz was raised,
the covering army was once more concentrated on the position of
Albuhera. The French Marshal did not, however, attack; on the 17th
of June, the British crossed the Guadiana, and prepared for the
probability of an engagement with the united corps of Marshals
Marmont and Soult. In July, the British were relieved from their
presence, and the Commander-in-Chief, Viscount Wellington, leaving
Lieut.-General Hill to watch Estremadura, at Portalegre, Villa
Viciosa, and Estremos, with ten thousand men, put the rest of the
army into quarters near the Tagus.

The THIRTY-FIRST continued with Lieut.-General Hill in the second
division: this part of the army was constantly on the alert, but
nothing very important occurred until October.

On the 9th of October, Lieut.-General Hill’s force was concentrated
behind Campo Mayor, and on the 22nd marched to drive Marshal Girard
from Caçeres: at daylight on the 28th of October, the British
General surprised the French Marshal at _Arroyo dos Molinos_, in
which brilliant affair the second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST was
present.

The army returned to its cantonments about Portalegre immediately
afterwards, and remained in them until the 24th and 25th of
December, when it moved upon Merida, and arrived there on the 30th
to surprise General Dombrouski, and attack General Drouet. They
both retired, abandoning magazines of wheat, and Lieut.-General
Hill took up his cantonments at Merida on the 6th of January, 1812.

[Sidenote: 1812]

Immediately afterwards Lieut.-General Hill fell back upon the
frontiers of Portugal, while the grand army was investing _Ciudad
Rodrigo_, and occupied Portalegre.

In March, _Badajoz_ was invested for the third time, and
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill’s[41] corps again formed part of
the covering army. He halted at Almendralejos, while Lieut.-General
Sir Thomas Graham (afterwards Lord Lynedoch) took post at Zafra.
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill’s division then moved forward,
and took post at Medellin. When the breaches at Badajoz were
nearly practicable, Marshal Soult, having effected a junction with
Generals Drouet and Daricau, advanced to relieve it. Viscount
Wellington thereupon determined to fight him at Albuhera.
Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Graham then fell back towards that place,
and Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill having destroyed the bridge at
Merida, marched from the Upper Guadiana to Talavera Real. Marshal
Soult did not however advance in time, and _Badajoz_ was taken on
the 6th of April.

After the fall of Badajoz, when Viscount Wellington marched towards
Beira, two divisions of British infantry, in one of which was the
second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST, remained with Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill in Estremadura, to cover Badajoz during the
re-establishment of its works. Nothing occurred in the army until
the 12th of May, when six thousand men, with twelve field-pieces,
crossed the Guadiana at Merida, and joining the battering train
and pontoons, formed the force destined to surprise the French at
_Almaraz_.

The THIRTY-FIRST remained in position on the Guadiana, while the
expedition proceeded to attack the French works on the Bridge at
_Almaraz_, on the Tagus, which were captured on the 19th of May.
The bridge having been destroyed, and the communication between the
several divisions of the French army rendered more difficult, the
British troops returned to the south of the Guadiana.

A great part of June was passed in operations against General
Drouet, until he was reinforced on the 18th of that month with
General Barrois’s division of infantry, and two divisions of
cavalry. Hereupon Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill fell back
gradually to Albuhera, and took up a position on the former field,
awaiting an attack. The enemy did not advance, and on the 2nd of
July, Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill broke up from Albuhera, and
moved upon General Drouet, who retired towards Cordova. At the end
of July, Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill was at Llerena, and the
second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, in Brigadier-General
Byng’s brigade, was detached to Merida. General Drouet made a
demonstration, but no action of infantry ensued.

After the victory gained by the army under Viscount Wellington on
the 22nd of July at Salamanca, the troops under Lieut.-General Sir
Rowland Hill penetrated the Spanish provinces: during the month of
August they were engaged in the pursuit of General Drouet, and in
the beginning of October they were on the Tagus, between Aranjuez
and Toledo.

While the army under the Marquis of Wellington, which title was
conferred upon him after the victory of Salamanca, was engaged
in the siege of the Castle of _Burgos_, the second battalion of
the THIRTY-FIRST regiment remained at Aranjuez. In consequence
of the necessity of raising the siege of Burgos, and retreating,
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill broke up from his ground on the
Tagus, to effect a junction with the grand army, which commenced
its retrograde movement from Burgos on the 21st of October.

On the 30th of October, Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill, having
taken up a position of defence on the Jarama, was pressed by
the enemy, who attacked the bridge of Aranjuez. The French were
repulsed by Colonel Skerrett, with the forty-seventh (of which he
was the Lieutenant-Colonel), and part of the ninety-fifth regiment,
now the Rifle Brigade. The retreat continued without molestation;
and on the 8th of November, the troops under Lieut.-General Sir
Rowland Hill were at Alba, while the Marquis of Wellington occupied
the heights of San Christoval. The brigade of the second division,
in which the second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST was posted, being
in the neighbourhood of the fords of Encinas.

On the 14th of November, the enemy passed the river near that
place, and the Marquis of Wellington moved with the second division
to attack him, while the remainder of the troops were ordered
towards the Arapiles in the evening. No engagement occurred. The
enemy fortified himself at Mozarbes, on the ground he had taken
up the night before, and moved bodies of cavalry and infantry to
the communication with Ciudad Rodrigo. The superiority of numbers
on the part of the French caused the British army to continue its
march to Ciudad Rodrigo, which it reached on the 19th of November.
Thus ended the retreat from Burgos. The men had suffered greatly
on the march and required rest; the enemy had pressed the retreat
closely with his cavalry, and made an attack upon the rear upon
the passage of the Huebra; the roads were difficult, and in some
parts impassable. The second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST did not
share in the hardships of the main retreat until it had crossed the
Tormes.

Marshal Soult having retired to the Upper Tormes, towards the pass
of Banos, it was reported that he intended to invade Portugal by
the valley of the Tagus. Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill’s division
was therefore moved to the right as far as Robledo, to cover the
pass of Perales. King Joseph, however, in December, took up his
position for the winter, and the allied army was also distributed
in quarters.

Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill’s division occupied Coria and
Placentia, the THIRTY-FIRST being cantoned in the latter place.

[Sidenote: 1813]

The allied army remained in cantonments until the month of May
1813; on the 19th of that month the second battalion of the
THIRTY-FIRST, in the second division, broke up from its winter
quarters, and, forming a part of the right wing of the army, shared
in the operations during the advance upon Burgos and Vittoria; in
the plan for the action of the 21st of June, before _Vittoria_,
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill’s corps, composed of Morillo’s
Spaniards, Sylveira’s Portuguese, and the second British division,
forming the right of the allied army, was to attack the enemy’s
left, and forcing the passage of the lower Zadora, at Puebla,
assail the French on the heights beyond, entering the plain of
Vittoria, by the defile of La Puebla. The river was passed about
ten o’clock A.M., and Morillo’s Spaniards assailed the mountain
with his first brigade; but meeting with much resistance on the
heights, called up his second brigade, which, the French being also
reinforced, was supported by part of the second division, while
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill, with the rest, passed through
the defile, and, seizing the village of _Subijana de Alava_, held
his ground: he thus connected his own right with the troops on
the mountain, and maintained this forward position, although
the French made great efforts to dislodge the allies from this
vantage-ground.

Meanwhile the fourth division crossed by the bridge of Nanclares.
The action on the British right was severe, and sustained with
great gallantry. The French, being driven from all their defences,
retreated with such precipitation towards Pampeluna as to abandon
all their baggage, artillery, ammunition, military chests, and the
court equipage of King Joseph, whose carriage being seized, he
had barely time to escape on horseback. The defeat was the most
complete that the French had experienced in Spain.

The bâton of Marshal Jourdan was taken, and the Prince Regent,
in the name and behalf of his Majesty, appointed the Marquis of
Wellington a Field-Marshal. In a most flattering letter, the Prince
Regent thus conferred the honor:--“You have sent me among the
trophies of your unrivalled fame, the staff of a French Marshal,
and I send you in return that of England.”

During part of the day, the second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST
was stationed to cover a brigade of guns: its loss was not very
great, being one private killed, and thirteen wounded. Captain
Girdlestone was the only officer of the THIRTY-FIRST who was
wounded.

Lieut.-Colonel Leith received a medal for his conduct in command
of the battalion, and the Royal Authority was afterwards given
for the word “VITTORIA” to be inscribed on the Regimental Colour
and Appointments of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, to commemorate the
gallantry of the second battalion in that battle.

The second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment shared in the
pursuit of the enemy after his defeat at Vittoria, and, when the
Marquis of Wellington marched on the 26th of June to intercept the
French General Clausel, it remained with the other corps of the
second division for the siege of _Pampeluna_.

Although the enemy had withdrawn his right and left into France,
he maintained his centre in force in the rich valley of _Bastan_,
which afforded numerous strong positions, and the troops under
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill, having been relieved from the
blockade of Pampeluna, advanced to dislodge the French. On the 4th
of July, and the three following days, General Gazan was driven
from the valley of Bastan by the troops under Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill, and the positions abandoned by the enemy were
occupied by the British. Major-General Byng’s brigade, of which the
THIRTY-FIRST formed part, with some Spanish corps under General
Morillo, took possession of the Pass of _Roncesvalles_ on the 7th
of July. In this celebrated valley the THIRTY-FIRST remained for a
few days.

Marshal Soult having arrived at Bayonne on the 13th of July to
command, as Lieutenant of the Emperor, the united French army of
Spain, amounting to above seventy-eight thousand men, exclusive of
garrisons, collected more than sixty thousand of his own left, and
advanced on the 25th of July to force the Pass of _Roncesvalles_.
The brigade which had been ordered to occupy the Pass, and of
which the THIRTY-FIRST formed a part, kept the French in check for
several hours, but was obliged to fall back, on perceiving that a
strong body had succeeded in turning the position.

The THIRTY-FIRST had two privates killed, and three wounded, in
the action on the 25th of July. On the 28th and 30th of July, the
battalion was engaged in the attack made upon the enemy on the
heights in front of _Pampeluna_, and had Captain Girdlestone,
Ensign Smith, and Quarter-Master McIntosh, together with
thirty-three rank and file, wounded:--two rank and file were killed.

Lieut.-Colonel Leith received a clasp, in addition to his former
medal, for his conduct on these occasions.

The THIRTY-FIRST regiment subsequently received the Royal
Authority to bear the word “PYRENEES” on the Regimental Colour and
Appointments, to commemorate the services of the second battalion
in these several combats, which have been designated the “_Battles
of the Pyrenees_.”

On the 31st of July, Major-General Byng’s brigade captured a large
convoy near _Elizondo_, and made many prisoners.

The British troops resumed their position in the Pyrenees, awaiting
the capture of St. Sebastian and Pampeluna. St. Sebastian was
captured on the 31st of August, and on the 31st of October the
French garrison of Pampeluna surrendered prisoners of war.

Pampeluna being captured, the right of the allied army, which had
been employed in covering the blockade, became disengaged, and
the British Commander looking down from the lofty Pyrenees on the
well-guarded territory of France, resolved to carry the war into
the heart of that country. The British army, early on the morning
of the 10th of November, descended into the valleys on the French
side; the division of which the THIRTY-FIRST formed part entered
France by the Pass of _Maya_, having sustained some loss in the
capture of one of the enemy’s redoubts. Only one man belonging to
the battalion was killed, but Captain Girdlestone and eleven rank
and file were wounded. Marshal Soult’s army was driven from his
fortified position on the river _Nivelle_, and several guns and
prisoners were captured. The French being pursued on the following
day, retired to their fortified camp near Bayonne.

Captain Thomas Samuel Nicolls was promoted to the rank of Major
in the army for his conduct on this day, and the THIRTY-FIRST
afterwards received the Royal Authority to bear the word “NIVELLE”
on the Regimental Colour and Appointments, in testimony of the
gallantry of the second battalion in that action.

The passage of the river _Nive_ was effected on the 9th of
December: the THIRTY-FIRST passed over without the loss of a man,
one serjeant only being wounded.

Lieut.-Colonel Leith received an additional clasp for his conduct
on this occasion, and Captains Patrick Dowdall and Peter Fearon
were promoted to the rank of Majors in the army.

On the 13th of December, the second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment shared in the action at _St. Pierre_, near Bayonne,
when the enemy abandoned two pieces of cannon, which were taken
possession of by Captain Hemsworth’s company.

The Marquis of Wellington, in his despatch dated _St. Jean de Luz_,
14th December 1813, thus alluded to the conduct of the brigade
under Major-General John Byng,[42] of which the THIRTY-FIRST formed
part.

  “I had great satisfaction, also, in observing the conduct of
  Major-General Byng’s brigade of British infantry, supported
  by the fourth Portuguese brigade, under the command of
  Brigadier-General Buchan, in carrying an important height from
  the enemy on the right of our position, and maintaining it
  against all their efforts to regain it.

  “_Two guns and some prisoners_ were taken from the enemy, who
  being beaten at all points, and having suffered considerable
  loss, were obliged to retire upon their entrenchment.”

In a very interesting life of the late Viscount Hill, by the
Reverend Edwin Sidney, A.M. is the following account of the action
at _St. Pierre_, near Bayonne.

  “This great service was thus performed by Sir Rowland Hill.
  The enemy, who had failed in all their attempts with their
  whole force upon Lord Wellington’s left, withdrew to their
  entrenchments on the night of December 12th, and passed a large
  body of troops through the town of Bayonne. With these, on
  the morning of the 13th, they made a desperate attack on Sir
  Rowland Hill. This, as has appeared, was not unexpected; and
  Lord Wellington had placed at his disposal not only the sixth
  division, but the fourth division, and two brigades of the third.
  Soult’s objects were to gain the bridge of _St. Pierre_, to
  make himself master of the road to St. Jean Pied de Port, and
  to break through the position of the allies. For these purposes
  he put forth his whole strength, and was completely vanquished.
  Even before the sixth division arrived, Sir Rowland Hill had
  repulsed him with prodigious loss; and although he skilfully
  availed himself of a high ground in retreating, he could not
  stand against the famous charge of General Byng, and was entirely
  defeated. It was a battle fought and won by the corps of Sir
  Rowland Hill alone and unaided. At the instant of victory Lord
  Wellington came up, and in the ecstasy of the moment of triumph,
  caught him by the hand, and said, ‘Hill, the day is your own.’”

The THIRTY-FIRST had seven rank and file _killed_, and three
serjeants, two drummers, and twenty-seven rank and file _wounded_.

Lieut.-Colonel Leith, who received a cross for his conduct, was
slightly wounded. Ensign Hardy died of his wounds.

Brevet Major Peter Fearon, of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, who
commanded the fifth Portuguese Caçadores, received an additional
distinction to the medal which had been granted him for the battle
of Albuhera.

The THIRTY-FIRST subsequently received the Royal Authority to
bear on the Regimental colour the word “NIVE,” to commemorate the
gallantry of the second battalion in the actions which ensued on
the passage of that river.

No further actions occurred during the few remaining days of the
year 1813; and the army occupied winter-quarters.

[Sidenote: 1814]

Leaving their cantonments at the village of St. Pierre, the
THIRTY-FIRST advanced with the troops under Lieut.-General Sir
Rowland Hill, in the middle of February 1814, when the French
corps, under General Harispe, were driven from Hellete, and
afterwards forced from a position on the heights of _Garris_ on
the 15th of February. The battalion had one private killed, and six
rank and file wounded. Brevet Major Peter Fearon, who commanded the
fifth Portuguese Caçadores, died of his wounds. The other officer
wounded was Captain Knox, who was subsequently promoted to the
brevet rank of major.

On the 27th of February, the second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST,
in Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill’s division, crossed the Adour,
on the right of _Orthes_, with the loss of only two rank and file
wounded.

Lieut.-Colonel Leith gained another distinction, and the
THIRTY-FIRST afterwards received the Royal Authority to bear
the word “ORTHES” on the Regimental Colour and Appointments, in
commemoration of the conduct of the second battalion in that battle.

Advancing rapidly against the enemy, Lieut.-General Sir Rowland
Hill engaged him at _Aire_, on which occasion the THIRTY-FIRST had
Ensign Hardcastle (Captain in the third Portuguese Caçadores) one
serjeant, and two rank and file wounded.

On the 10th of April, the second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment was in action with the French in the suburbs of
_Toulouse_, and had one private wounded.

During the night of the 11th of April, the French army evacuated
Toulouse, and the white flag was hoisted. On the day following,
the Marquis of Wellington entered the city amidst the acclamations
of the inhabitants. In the afternoon of this day intelligence was
received of the abdication of Napoleon; and had not the express
been delayed on the journey by the French police, the sacrifice of
many valuable lives would have been prevented. A disbelief in the
truth of this intelligence occasioned much unnecessary bloodshed
at _Bayonne_, the garrison of which made a desperate sortie on the
14th of April, and Lieut.-General Sir John Hope (afterwards Earl of
Hopetoun) was wounded and taken prisoner. Major-General Andrew Hay
was killed, and Major-General Stopford was wounded. This was the
last action of the Peninsular war.

The advance of the Allied troops into the heart of France led to a
Treaty of Peace, by which Louis XVIII. was restored to the throne
of that kingdom, and Napoleon Bonaparte was permitted to reside at
Elba, the sovereignty of that Island having been conferred upon him
by the Allied Powers.

The war being ended, the second battalion of the THIRTY-FIRST
regiment was ordered to return to England. It marched from Toulouse
to Bourdeaux on the 3rd of June, and on the 12th of July embarked
in the Rodney, disembarking on the 23rd at the Cove of Cork, whence
it immediately marched to Middleton.

In commemoration of the services of the second battalion, the
THIRTY-FIRST subsequently received the Royal Authority to bear the
word “PENINSULA,” on the Regimental Colour and Appointments, in
addition to the names of the several actions in which the second
battalion had taken a prominent part, during the war in Spain
from 1808 to 1814, namely, “TALAVERA,” “ALBUHERA,” “VITTORIA,”
“PYRENEES,” “NIVELLE,” “NIVE,” and “ORTHES.”

Lieut.-Colonel Alexander Leith was nominated a Knight Commander
of the Order of the Bath for his conduct in command of the second
battalion during the Peninsular war.

Lieut.-Colonel George Guy Carleton L’Estrange, who was promoted
from major in the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, to the rank of
Lieut.-Colonel in the twenty-sixth regiment on the 15th of
December 1812, was nominated a Companion of the Order of the Bath
for his conduct while serving with the second battalion of the
THIRTY-FIRST regiment.

On the 23rd of September, the _second battalion_ proceeded to
Portsmouth, where it was disbanded on the 24th of October 1814, the
officers and men, fit for service, being transferred to the _first
battalion_ of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, at that period stationed
in Sicily.

_Memoir of the Services of_ COLONEL SAMUEL BOLTON, C.B. _of the_
THIRTY-FIRST _Regiment_.

This officer was appointed an ensign in the THIRTY-FIRST regiment
on the 5th of February 1807, in which regiment he was promoted to
be lieutenant on the 6th of April 1809. Lieutenant Bolton served
with the second battalion during the Peninsular war from 1808 to
1814, and was present at the battles of Talavera, Busaco, and
Albuhera, in the last of which he was wounded: took part in the
capture of Marshal Girard’s division at Arroyo dos Molinos on the
28th of October 1811, and shared in the battle of Vittoria; also in
the actions in the Pyrenees, at the Nive, Garris, Orthes, Aire, and
Toulouse.

Lieutenant Bolton was appointed adjutant to the second battalion
on the 31st of March 1813, but returned to his duty as lieutenant
upon the reduction of the second battalion on the 24th of October
1814. He was promoted to the rank of captain on the 24th of October
1822; and on the 7th of February 1825, embarked with the left wing
of the regiment for the East Indies. Captain Bolton was promoted to
the rank of major in the THIRTY-FIRST regiment on the 14th of June
1833, and to that of lieutenant-colonel on the 24th of November
1835.

Lieut.-Colonel Bolton served in the Affghanistan campaign of 1842,
and commanded the THIRTY-FIRST regiment in the action at Mazeena,
in the Shinwaree valley, on the 26th of July 1842; at Tezeen on
the 13th of September 1842, and at the occupation of Cabool by
Major-General Pollock.

For his services in Affghanistan, Lieut.-Colonel Bolton received
a medal, and was promoted to the rank of colonel on the 23rd of
December 1842; he was also appointed aide-de-camp to Her Majesty,
and was nominated a Companion of the Most Honorable Order of the
Bath.

Colonel Bolton served with the army of the Sutlej in 1845, as
Brigadier to the first brigade under the command of General Sir
Hugh (now Viscount) Gough, Commander-in-Chief in India at that
period. Colonel Bolton received a severe wound at the battle of
_Moodkee_ on the 18th of December 1845, from the effects of which
he died on the 4th of January 1846.


LIEUT.-COLONEL THOMAS SKINNER, C.B.[43]

Lieut.-Colonel Thomas Skinner, the eldest son of Lieut.-General
John Skinner, while at Eton College, was on the 25th of January
1816, appointed to an ensigncy in the sixteenth regiment of foot,
to which regiment his father had been attached for thirty-nine
years, before he attained the rank of Major-General; Ensign
Skinner joined the sixteenth regiment in Ireland in the year
1817, then commanded by the late Major-General (then Colonel)
Tolley. Major-General Tolley, the best Greek scholar of his day
at Westminster, amused his leisure with classical literature, and
invited the young Etonian to share his studies; and thus making
complete his education, fortunately imbued him with that taste
for letters which secured to him through life a most agreeable
resource. In 1819, the regiment being ordered to Ceylon, he
obtained, by purchase, a lieutenancy on the 6th of August, and
proceeded to that colony. While there he was employed to make the
roads constructed by the late Lieut.-General Sir Edward Barnes,
afterwards Colonel of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment. Lieutenant Skinner
was appointed adjutant to the sixteenth regiment on the 20th of
April 1820, and did duty in that capacity until 1822, when his
Commanding Officer returned to England, and obtaining leave of
absence for his young friend, they travelled home together through
India and Egypt, visiting Malta and Sicily, and thence through
Italy and France to England. Lieutenant Skinner was promoted to an
unattached company on the 9th of October 1823, and on the 20th of
March, 1824, was appointed Captain in the THIRTY-FIRST regiment.
In February 1825, he sailed with the left wing of the THIRTY-FIRST
in the _Scaleby Castle_ for Calcutta, the regiment being ordered
to reinforce the army at that time acting in Burmah; but owing to
the burning of her consort, the _Kent_ East Indiaman, in the Bay
of Biscay, with the right wing, the regiment was inefficient, and
remained in garrison at Calcutta. In 1829, Captain Skinner returned
home on leave of absence in the _Cartha_, and nearly suffered
shipwreck on the coast of Wales. The vessel being driven by storm
when off Liverpool, was unable to weather Bardsea Island, and
fortunately passed safely through the narrow channel between that
rock, and the coast of Carnarvon into Pwelli Bay. He did not lose
his time in India; for with his brother, Captain James Skinner, of
the sixty-first regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, he travelled
to the sources of the Ganges and the Jumna, an account of which
was published in 1833, from letters written at the time, in two
volumes, entitled “_Excursions in India_,” and the work passed
through two editions. During his leave of absence he travelled
over England and Scotland, and made himself as well acquainted
with those parts of his native land, as, in the course of his
professional duties, he had previously become with Ireland. In
December 1833, by permission of General Lord Hill, Commanding in
Chief, he travelled by the Holy Land and Bagdad to India to rejoin
the THIRTY-FIRST regiment. An account of these travels, in two
volumes, was published in 1836, under the title of “_Adventures
during a Journey overland to India_” which also passed through two
editions. On the 24th of November, 1835, he was promoted Major in
the THIRTY-FIRST regiment. Emulous of his father’s skill as an
officer of Light Infantry, he diligently cultivated that branch
of the service, availing himself of the opportunity of practising
manœuvres in the field afforded to those serving in India, by
the collection of large bodies of men at the principal stations.
In 1840, his health being affected by the climate, Lord Hill
considerately forwarded to him, through the General commanding in
India, leave of absence, of which he declined to avail himself,
as he thought his services might be useful in the then state of
India. On the 23rd of November 1840, he was entrusted to take from
Chinsurah a large body of recruits, about twenty young officers,
and about twenty-two young women and as many children, to their
destinations where they arrived in health, and without complaint of
any sort against them in the districts through which they passed.
The Commander-in-Chief in India thus expressed his thanks for this
unprecedented success in such duty.

  “The Commander-in-Chief takes an early opportunity of conveying
  his best thanks to Major Skinner, of Her Majesty’s THIRTY-FIRST
  regiment, for the forethought, caution, and exertion shown by him
  in marching a body of 489 recruits from Chinsurah to Cawnpore and
  Agra, without the loss of a man, except one accidentally drowned
  while bathing in the Soane. His Excellency requests that Major
  Skinner will report to him in what degree the medical officers
  contributed to this very desirable result, in order that their
  skill and attention may be duly appreciated and remembered.”

Major Skinner, for this service, was rewarded with the appointment
of Commandant of the Convalescent Depôt at Landour.

Upon the march of the army under Major-General Pollock to
Affghanistan, where Captain James Skinner, of the sixty-first
Bengal Native Infantry, was reported to be a prisoner, having been
wounded on the retreat from Cabool, Major Skinner resigned at once
his lucrative and pleasant post, and by forced journeys, joined
the THIRTY-FIRST regiment, in February 1842; his anxiety for his
brother, whom he had hoped to be in part the means of rescuing,
only appeased by the distressing certainty of his violent and
untimely death. Major Skinner rendered very important services at
the battle of _Mazeena_, for which he was particularly thanked by
Brigadier Monteath; Major Skinner’s account of the transaction was
also included in the despatches published in the “London Gazette.”

From the fatigue and exposure in the action at _Mazeena_ on the
26th of July 1842, Major Skinner was seized with the fever of that
country, living, to avoid the heat and dust, in a hole dug in the
ground, the air being pestilent and the water corrupt, from the
mortality of animals. His life was, however, spared for the service
of his country. Though still suffering from the malignant disease,
which rest might then have cured, he commenced his labours, being
removed from the sick list on the very day he marched with the
second division, under Major-General McCaskill, commanding, on the
8th of September 1842, the advance guard to Soorkhab, on the 9th
to Jugdulluck; a running fight being kept up the whole way; on the
10th to Kutta Sung; and on the 11th the rear-guard to Tezeen. He
was specially thanked in Major-General McCaskill’s despatches for
the manner in which he performed these duties. In the afternoon
of the 12th of September he was despatched to the heights of the
Huft-Kotul, and commenced at daylight of the 13th, by attacking
the enemy on the heights, those operations which ended in the
victory of Tezeen. Major-general Pollock stated, “that the Major’s
duty was performed with great gallantry, and his operations
contributed much to frustrate the attempts of the enemy on the
right flank.” The Major-General enclosed in the despatches the
detailed account of Major Skinner’s movements, which were published
in the “London Gazette.”

Proceeding from Tezeen to Cabool on the 10th of October, he
commanded five companies of the THIRTY-FIRST regiment at the
destruction of the Great Bazaar, which, from the skilful
arrangement of the force, was effected almost without loss of life.
On the march from Cabool to India his conduct was thought from
time to time deserving of praise by those under whom he acted. On
his arrival at Ferozepore, he was chosen for the imposing duty of
commanding the Guard of Honor, consisting of artillery, cavalry,
and infantry, escorting the embassy to Lahore.

On the 23rd of December 1842, he was promoted to the rank of
lieut.-colonel in the army, was three days afterwards made a
Companion of the Most Honorable Military Order of the Bath, and
was presented by the government of India with the silver medal
of Cabool, bearing on one side “_Cabool_ 1842,” and on the other
“_Victoria Vindex_.”

Unfortunately Lieut.-Colonel Skinner did not live long to enjoy the
rewards of his useful services, for his decease occurred on the 5th
of May 1843, at Mussoorie, in the Himalaya Mountains, from disease
brought on by privation and fatigue during the Affghan campaign.
Lieut.-Colonel Skinner was buried the next morning at Landour with
military honors, the arms of a native corps being borrowed for the
European invalids stationed there at their own request. They formed
the funeral procession and firing party, an honorable mark of
respect never before paid by them on any similar occasion. The body
was attended to the grave by every European, civil or military, in
the place, and by a very large proportion of the native population,
to whom he had been previously known as commandant, and by whom he
was greatly loved and deeply lamented. His brother officers erected
over his remains a tomb of Delhi stone, and his death was announced
to the regiment by Colonel Bolton in a regimental order, which did
full justice to his merits “_as a good and gallant officer_,”
expressing at the same time, that “_he was devotedly attached to
his profession, and that he was the warm advocate and steady friend
of the well-deserving soldier_.”


MAJOR GEORGE BALDWIN.

This officer commenced his military career as ensign in the
thirty-sixth regiment, on the 2nd of June 1808. He served in
Holland during 1809 and 1810, and was present at the capture of
Walcheren and siege of Flushing. Ensign Baldwin was removed from
the thirty-sixth to the third Ceylon regiment on the 4th of April
1811, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in the fourteenth
regiment of foot on the 9th of November 1814. Lieutenant Baldwin
was present at the memorable battle of Waterloo, for which he
received a medal, and served at the storming of Cambray on the 24th
of June 1815. He exchanged from the half-pay of the seventy-fifth
regiment to the THIRTY-FIRST on the 14th of March 1822, and
embarked for India on the 7th of February 1825, with the right
wing of the regiment on board the ship _Kent_, which was burnt at
sea on the 1st of March following. Lieutenant Baldwin received a
severe injury when the ship was in flames, by an iron spike running
into his thigh. Lieutenant Baldwin was promoted to the rank of
Captain in the THIRTY-FIRST regiment on the 14th of June 1833. He
served in the campaign of Affghanistan in 1842; was present in
the action at Mazeena on the 26th of July 1842; at Tezeen on the
13th of September following; and at the occupation of Cabool by
Major-General Pollock. For his services in Affghanistan he was
rewarded with a medal, and received the brevet rank of major on the
23rd of December 1842. On the 8th of October 1844 he was promoted
to the rank of major in the THIRTY-FIRST regiment. Major Baldwin
served with the army of the Sutlej in 1845, was present at the
battles of Moodkee and Ferozeshah; in the latter he was mortally
wounded. Major Baldwin died on the 30th of December 1845.

As the _Thirtieth_, _Thirty-first_, and _Thirty-second_ Regiments
were originally raised, in 1702, as _Marine Corps_, and served in
that capacity until the year 1714, when they were retained, as
Regiments of regular Infantry, on the Establishment of the Army,
the following account of the _Marine Corps_ is appended,--it
being found impracticable to record the earlier services of the
_Thirtieth_, _Thirty-first_ and _Thirty-second_ Regiments distinct
from those of the _Marine Corps_, in consequence of their being
employed, from 1702 to 1714, _by detachments_ on board the Fleet,
and engaged on various services at Sea, as well as on land,
according to the purposes for which they were originally raised.

MARINE CORPS.


The advantages arising from the services of corps trained to the
use of arms _on board of ship, as well as on land_, were found
when the British navy acquired a superiority over that of other
nations of Europe; and as the safety of Great Britain, from its
insular position, chiefly depends on the efficiency and excellence
of her fleets, the importance and value of _Marine Forces_ have
consequently been at all times acknowledged and appreciated by the
Sovereign, as well as by the Nation at large.

[Sidenote: 1664]

The first corps raised for Sea-service, of which history gives
an account, is that which was formed by King Charles II., in the
year 1664, when the war with Holland took place: this corps was
commanded by the Duke of York (afterwards King James II.), then
Lord High Admiral of Great Britain, and was designated “_The
Admiral’s Maritime Regiment_.”[44]

[Sidenote: 1672]

In the year 1672 a dispute on the subject of naval precedence,
and other causes, gave rise to another war with the Dutch, and
battalions for _Sea-service_ were formed, as the occasions of the
State required, by drafts from the land forces, which were embarked
on board the fleet; several companies of the Foot Guards were
employed on the Marine duty; these companies were engaged in a
sharp fight with the Dutch fleet on the 28th of May, 1672, in which
upwards of two thousand men were killed; they were also engaged in
several other actions during the war which ended in February, 1674.

[Sidenote: 1689]

In 1689 King William III. incorporated “_the Admiral’s Regiment_”
(which was then considered the third regiment of Infantry) in the
Second, now the Coldstream, regiment of Foot Guards. Two Marine
regiments were, about the same time, established for service on
board the fleet, which were disbanded in 1698.

[Sidenote: 1702]

On the recommencement of hostilities, in 1702, with France and
Spain, both of which nations possessed powerful fleets as well
as numerous armies, the British Parliament felt the expediency
of enabling the Queen to increase the efficiency of her navy, by
forming _Corps of Marines_, which could act at sea as well as on
land.

Six regiments were accordingly added in the year 1702 to the
regular Army as _Marine corps_, and six other of the regular
regiments of Infantry were appointed for _Sea-service_; as shown in
the following list.

The six Regiments of Marines were:--

  Colonel Thomas Saunderson’s, now thirtieth foot.
  Colonel George Villiers’s, now thirty-first foot.
  Colonel Edward Fox’s, now thirty-second foot.
  Colonel Harry Mordaunt’s; disbanded in 1713.
  Colonel Henry Holl’s; disbanded in 1713.
  Colonel Viscount Shannon’s; disbanded in 1713.

The six regiments of Foot for _Sea-service_ were:--

  Colonel Ventris Columbine’s, now sixth foot.
  Colonel Thomas Erle’s, now nineteenth foot.
  Colonel Gustavus Hamilton’s, now twentieth foot.
  Colonel Lord Lucas’s, now thirty-fourth foot.
  Colonel Earl of Donegal’s, now thirty-fifth foot.
  Colonel Lord Charlemont’s, now thirty-sixth foot.

Her Majesty’s Order for levying this body of men was contained in
the following Royal Warrant, dated 1st of June, 1702:--

  “ANNE R.

  “Our pleasure is, that this establishment of _six regiments of
  Marines_, and six other regiments for _Sea-Service_, do commence
  and take place from the respective times of raising.

  “And our further pleasure is, that the order given by our dearest
  brother the late King, deceased, and such orders as are, or shall
  be, given by us, touching the pay or entertainment of our said
  forces, or any of them, or any charges thereunto belonging, shall
  be duly complied with, and that no new charge be added to this
  establishment without being communicated to our High Treasurer,
  or Commissioners of our Treasury for the time being.

  “Given at our Court at St. James’s, on the first day of June in
  the first year of our reign.

      “_By Her Majesty’s Command._
      “GODOLPHIN.”


Other regiments were also embarked, at different periods, during
the war, on board the fleet to act as Marines, and the efficiency
and usefulness of these corps, while so employed, were attested by
the capture of several fortresses in Spain; more especially that of
Gibraltar in 1704, the taking of which was effected by the Navy and
Marines.

Rules and Instructions for the better government of the Marine
regiments were issued by authority of Her Majesty Queen Anne, on
the 1st of July, 1702, in which it was directed, “That when on
shore they were to be quartered in the vicinity of the dock-yards,
in order to guard them from embezzlement, or from any attempt that
might be made on them by an enemy.”

Full instructions were also given as to their pay, subsistence, and
clothing, which directed, “that the same deductions should be made
for clothing as was usual in the land forces. Also that one day’s
pay in every year be deducted from officers and soldiers for the
Hospital.

“When on board ship they were to have an equal proportion of
provisions with the seamen, without any deductions from their pay,
the soldiers receiving short allowance money like the seamen.”

In order to render such portions of the Marine regiments as might
be on shore, useful on all occasions when their services might be
required, Her Majesty directed, that it should rest with herself,
or with the Lord High Admiral, the Prince George of Denmark, to
dispose of them at such places nearest to the several dock-yards as
might be judged most convenient; and as there might be occasion for
labourers to despatch necessary public works, Her Majesty empowered
the High Admiral, or the Commissioners for executing that office,
to cause to be employed in the dock-yards so many of the marine
soldiers as might be judged fitting, and to make them such daily
allowance for their labour, besides their ordinary pay, as should
seem reasonable.

The Marine forces being thus placed under the control of the Lord
High Admiral, His Royal Highness was pleased in 1702, to nominate
Colonel William Seymour (of the fourth regiment of foot) to
superintend the whole, with the rank of Brigadier-General, whose
peculiar duties were to observe, that the men were comfortably
quartered, that the officers were attentive in their respective
departments, and that the marine soldiers, when embarked on board
of ship, were supplied with proper sea-clothes and other suitable
necessaries. When the Marines were serving afloat, they were to be
under the command of the Naval Officers of the ships.

The Uniform of the Marine forces consisted of high-crowned
leather-caps, covered with cloth of the same colour as the facings
of the regiment, and ornamented with devices, the same as the caps
worn by the grenadiers; scarlet frock-coat; buff waist-belt; black
pouch carried in front, with bayonet-belt attached; buff gaiters.

During the reign of Queen Anne, certain Independent Companies of
Marines were raised for the purpose of aiding in the defence of the
British possessions in the West Indies.

The first important service on which the Marine corps were employed
in this reign, was on board the fleet under Admiral Sir Cloudesly
Shovel, then commanding in the Mediterranean, who was instructed to
make every possible arrangement, by conciliation or by conquest,
among the dependencies of the French and Spanish monarchies, in
order to ensure a cordial reception of the Archduke Charles of
Austria, in opposition to Philip, Duke of Anjou, of France, to the
throne of Spain.

[Sidenote: 1704]

After some delays, the Archduke arrived at Lisbon under Admiral Sir
George Rooke, on the 25th of February, 1704, in order to concert a
plan of future operations with his ally the King of Portugal.

Sir George Rooke, after cruising with the fleet on the coast
of Portugal, returned to Lisbon, and took the Prince of
Hesse-Darmstadt on board, with whom he sailed on the 20th of
April to Barcelona. On the arrival of the fleet before Barcelona,
the Prince of Hesse sent a letter to Don Velasco, the governor,
requiring him to surrender the town, which he refused. Information,
however, being received that the city would declare for Charles
III. if a show of attack were made,--sixteen hundred Marines were
accordingly landed at the request, and under the command, of
Major-General the Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt, on the 19th of May,
1704: this force, being found to be inadequate for the purpose, was
re-embarked on the following day.

The next object of attack was the Rock of _Gibraltar_, where the
Prince of Hesse landed in the afternoon of the 21st of July, 1704,
with 1800 British and Dutch Marines. Acting upon the decision of a
council of war, His Highness proceeded to cut off all communication
with the mainland, to bombard the place, and to reduce it to the
obedience of Charles III., King of Spain. The governor, on being
summoned, refused to surrender, alleging that all the garrison had
taken an oath of allegiance to King Philip V.

Admiral Sir George Rooke having directed a strong force to proceed
against the South Mole, the enemy was driven from his guns; several
boats, manned and armed, were then detached under the command of
Captain Whitaker, of the Navy, who soon obtained possession of the
great platform: about one hundred of the besiegers, whose impetuous
bravery had carried them within the effects of a mine connected
with the fort, were killed or wounded by the explosion; the rest,
advancing rapidly, gained a redoubt half-way between the mole and
the town. The Governor, at the urgent desire of the inhabitants,
was induced to capitulate, and the Prince of Hesse took possession
of the garrison on the evening of Sunday the 24th of July 1704.
The loss in effecting the capture of this important fortress was
sixty-one killed, and two hundred and six wounded. The attack of
the seamen was one of the boldest and most difficult ever made,
being obliged to climb up rocks and precipices. Thus was taken, in
three days, a fortress since made impregnable to all assaults.

The loss of Gibraltar disconcerted the measures of Philip V., and
of his grandfather Louis XIV. Eight thousand men, under the Marquis
de Villadarias, were immediately detached from the Spanish army
to retake the fortress; and the French Admiral received orders
to engage the British and Dutch fleets, and to co-operate in the
recapture of Gibraltar. The hostile fleets engaged on the 24th of
August, about eleven leagues south of Malaga, and, after each had
suffered severely, they were separated in the night. The enemy
retired to Toulon, and Sir George Rooke sailed to Gibraltar. Here,
after having held a Council of War, it was determined to return
home; and the confederate fleet sailed for England, arriving at
Spithead on the 25th of September. Sir John Leake and Admiral
Vanderdussen were left at Lisbon to protect the coast of Portugal,
and relieve Gibraltar, if it should be besieged as was anticipated.

The Marquis de Villadarias commenced the siege of Gibraltar on the
22nd of October, and the garrison, composed of Marines, under the
command of the Prince of Hesse, sustained a siege by seven thousand
men. The purpose of the enemy was to have stormed from the South
Mole, united with the desperate attempt of a Spanish forlorn-hope
climbing the rock, and a general attack from the mainland. The
fortress was maintained against very superior numbers; and the fire
of the enemy’s batteries having damaged the works, a body of men
was landed from the fleet to assist in the defence. Brigadier Fox,
and several other officers and men, having been killed on the 5th
of December, 1704, aid was solicited from the army in Portugal.
Admiral Sir John Leake accordingly sailed from Lisbon on the 10th
of December, with a fleet, having on board a battalion of the first
and second foot guards; Barrymore’s regiment, now thirteenth foot;
Donegal’s regiment, now thirty-fifth foot; the Dutch regiment of
Waes; and a Portuguese regiment; amounting in all to upwards of
three thousand men. On their passage they fell in with the enemy’s
squadron under Monsieur de Pointi, but they succeeded in arriving
at Gibraltar, although some of the transports had separated.

These corps were safely landed on the 18th of December, and the
Prince, strengthened by this reinforcement, made a sortie on the
23rd, and destroyed the lines, that had been erected within a
hundred and sixty paces of the palisade.

[Sidenote: 1705]

The Marquis de Villadarias, having received a considerable
reinforcement, evinced a disposition to storm the place, and on the
2nd of February, 1705, an attempt was made against the Round Tower,
to ascertain what might be effected by a larger force. On the 7th
the enemy attacked with five hundred chosen grenadiers, French and
Walloons, commanded by Lieut.-General Thouy, and supported by one
thousand Spanish troops. They ascended the hill in perfect silence
at daybreak, and again attempted to storm the Round Tower, which
was defended by Colonel Borr, of the Marines, now thirty-second
regiment. The assailants, by throwing from above great stones
and grenades on his men, at last obliged him to retire into that
part of the works where the foot guards were posted. Flushed with
success, they advanced too far; when they were gallantly charged
by Colonel Moncall, of Barrymore’s (thirteenth) regiment, and
driven from the Round Tower. Colonel Rivett, of the Coldstream foot
guards, having got up the rock on the right of the covered-way with
twenty grenadiers, favoured very much Colonel Moncall’s success.
The garrison by this time had assembled, and kept up so destructive
a fire that the enemy was obliged to make a precipitate retreat,
losing seventy men killed on the spot; upwards of two hundred
wounded; and one captain, four lieutenants, and forty men taken.
The loss on the part of the garrison was twenty-seven men killed,
and one hundred and twenty wounded.

Marshal de Tessé arrived with additional troops to carry on the
siege; the garrison also received fresh reinforcements from
Portugal, besides supplies of every description. Admiral Sir John
Leake sailed from the Tagus on the 6th of March, 1705, and his
arrival in the bay of Gibraltar on the 10th, was again so sudden,
that he completely surprised the Baron de Pointi, together with the
whole of his squadron, consisting of live ships of the line, three
of which were captured, and two were driven on shore, and burnt by
the enemy.

After a siege of seven months the enemy retired, in April, giving
up all hopes of being able to make any impression on the fortress:
his efforts were then confined to a very feeble blockade.

The fortress of Gibraltar, seated upon the territory of Spain,
was thus rendered subject to the British crown by the bravery of
its Navy and Marines: its possession was subsequently secured by
the defence made against the renewed efforts of the Spaniards in
1727, and by the glorious defence sustained by the troops, under
General Lord Heathfield, for three years, from 1779 to 1782, when
it exhibited to the nations of Europe a brilliant instance of
the combined exertions of the British navy and army against the
repeated, but unsuccessful, attempts of Spain and France to recover
this important fortress.

After the Spaniards and French had desisted from further attempts
to retake Gibraltar, the Marine corps were distributed in the
several ships of war which were collected in the Tagus, in order to
co-operate with the land forces on the coast of Spain.

Towards the end of May, the English fleet, with about five thousand
land forces on board, under the joint command of Admiral Sir
Cloudesly Shovel and General the Earl of Peterborough, sailed
from St. Helen’s, and arrived at Lisbon on the 20th of June. King
Charles went on board the Ranelagh on the 23rd of July, and the
Dutch fleet having joined in the Tagus, the confederate squadron
sailed on the 28th, and anchored at Gibraltar on the 11th of
August. The Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt, with the battalion of foot
guards, and the thirteenth and thirty-fifth regiments, embarked,
and the fleet sailed for Altea Bay: form thence it again proceeded
on its voyage, and anchored before Barcelona on the 22nd of August.

The Earl of Peterborough commenced active operations against
_Barcelona_ by an attack on the strong fortress of _Montjuich_,
situated on the opposite part of the town, at which the
disembarkation took place, the troops having landed near the river
Bassoz, about three miles east of Barcelona, on the 23rd and
24th of August. On the 28th, King Charles went on shore, when the
inhabitants of the neighbouring towns and villages flocked to the
camp, and many took arms to act as guerilla-bands and miquelets. A
difference of opinion on the part of the Dutch General occasioned
some delay, but it was ultimately determined to attack the fortress
of _Montjuich_ by storm.

The storming party, consisting of four hundred grenadiers, with
a support of six hundred musketeers, commanded by the Earl
of Peterborough and the Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt, commenced
their march about ten o’clock on the night of Sunday the 13th
of September round the mountains, and were followed by another
detachment, and a party of dragoons. After traversing many miles of
rugged mountain scenery, by different tracks, the storming party
appeared about break of day at the foot of the mountain. Colonel
Southwell of the sixth foot, which was then acting as Marines, was
ordered to head the attack, and he succeeded in driving the enemy
from the outworks into the castle. Upon this success the Prince of
Hesse, advancing with great eagerness through all the fire, was
shot with a musket-ball in the thigh, and upon being carried to
an adjacent cottage, expired: this accident somewhat damped the
spirits of the soldiers;--at the same time a large reinforcement
was seen advancing from the town to aid the garrison in the Castle,
and the troops received orders from some inferior officer to
retire. The Earl of Peterborough rushed to the spot, countermanded
the order, seized the half-pike out of Lord Charlemont’s hand, and
rallied and led back the soldiers to the posts they had so nobly
won. The Spaniards, who were advancing from the town, turned back,
and the outworks of the Fortress of Montjuich were thus gained;
batteries were constructed, and the inner works were assailed with
cannon-balls, bombs, and grenades. On the 17th of September the
Fort surrendered, and thus facilitated the siege of the _City of
Barcelona_, which was prosecuted with vigour. The Admirals even
relinquished for a time their natural element, and acted on shore
as General Officers;--they came daily from their ships with a body
of men formed into companies, having captains and lieutenants of
their own. Cannon and mortars were dragged up steep precipices
by the men; and a breach being declared practicable, a body of
soldiers prepared to attack the town: further effusion of blood
was spared, however, by the surrender of the garrison, which
capitulated on the 9th of October.

The capture of Barcelona gave additional reputation to the
arms of the allies, and this splendid achievement was regarded
with astonishment throughout Europe. It was accompanied by the
submission of nearly all Catalonia; and Boyer, in his history
of these wars, observes, “all the generals, admirals, officers,
private soldiers, and seamen, engaged in this memorable expedition,
deserved each their share of the honour.”

[Sidenote: 1706]

King Charles and his counsellors, instead of exerting themselves
to provide for the security of the towns which had come into
their possession, and collecting the means for future conquests,
spent their time and money in balls and public diversions. The
breaches in _Barcelona_, and the fortress of _Montjuich_, were left
unrepaired, and the garrison unprovided for a siege. Meanwhile
King Philip was obtaining reinforcements from the favourers of
his cause in Portugal, Italy, Provence, Flanders, and the Rhine,
and he soon appeared at the head of above twenty thousand men to
recapture the provinces he had lost. A powerful French and Spanish
force approached Barcelona by land; a French fleet appeared before
the town, and the garrison, being weak in numbers, regiments were
hurried from other places, one English regiment travelling one
hundred and twenty miles on mules, in two days, to take part in the
defence of Barcelona. The siege was commenced in the beginning of
April, 1706, when the soldiers repaired the breaches, and entered
upon a resolute and desperate defence. A severe conflict took place
on the 21st of April at _Montjuich_, in which Lord Donegal, of the
thirty-fifth regiment, lost his life, and several prisoners were
taken by the enemy; but when the garrison was nearly exhausted, its
numbers decreased by deaths, wounds, sickness, and other causes, to
about a thousand effective men, and a practicable breach was ready
for the enemy to attack the place by storm, the English and Dutch
fleet arrived with five regiments of foot; the French fleet hurried
from before the town; and the reinforcements were landed.

The French, who had prepared to storm the place on the 10th of May,
relaxed in their efforts, and raised the siege on the following
day, making a precipitate retreat.

The important city of _Barcelona_ being thus relieved, the
fleet sailed on the 12th of May, and landed the forces of every
description on the coast of Valencia. This was preparatory to an
attack on _Alicant_. The capture of _Carthagena_ was in the interim
effected, and a garrison of six hundred marines under Major Hedges
was established for its defence.

The fleet arrived off _Alicant_ on the 26th of June, when the
Governor-General Mahoni, was summoned to surrender: a refusal
being made by the garrison, consisting of one thousand soldiers,
and many inhabitants of the town who had volunteered in its
defence, the bombardment of the city was resolved upon.

Brigadier Richard Gorges, who succeeded the Earl of Donegal, as
colonel of the thirty-fifth regiment, then serving as marines,
moved from Elcho on the 21st of July to within a mile of Alicant,
and all the marines of the fleet, with eight hundred seamen, were
landed on that day, and on the following morning:--the bombardment
commenced on the evening of the 22nd. A detachment of the navy,
under Admiral Sir George Byng, rendered very essential service by
dismounting many of the enemy’s guns on the coast. On the 24th of
July the marines arrived from Carthagena, and were immediately
landed; after four days the troops had gained possession of the
suburbs, and all the boats were manned, and armed, in order to
attack the town. On the 29th of July the ships having made a
practicable breach on the Round Tower, at the west end of the
place, and another at the middle of the curtain, the soldiers
advanced to storm them. General Mahoni retired into the Castle, and
was again summoned by Brigadier Gorges, and was at length obliged
to surrender his charge on the 25th of August, after a most gallant
resistance, and a heavy loss.

The fleet proceeded to _Iviça_, where it arrived on the 9th
of September: the governor immediately saluted, and tendered
submission to King Charles III. It was next resolved to attack
_Majorca_, which surrendered on the 14th of September: a garrison
of one captain, one lieutenant, and one hundred marines, was placed
in this island.

[Sidenote: 1707]

In June, 1707, an opportunity offered of co-operating with the
Duke of Savoy and Prince Eugene, in an intended attack upon Toulon:
the fleet proceeded for the coast of Italy, where it anchored, on
the 28th of June, between Nice and Antibes, about a league from
the Var: after a conference between the commanders-in-chief, it
was decided that a joint attack should be made upon a part of the
enemy’s army then entrenched upon that river: the positions, being
evacuated by the enemy, were immediately occupied by six hundred
British seamen and marines: the passage was thus secured for the
Duke of Savoy to prosecute his designs, and frigates were stationed
along different parts of the sea-coast: every aid was afforded by
the fleet both as to men and cannon; but the enemy having daily
augmented his forces, and having made a successful sally, the siege
was raised on the 10th of August, 1707, after a loss of more than a
thousand men. The French, from a sudden dread of consequences, sunk
a number of their largest ships of war, which were ever after unfit
for service.

[Sidenote: 1708]

King Charles having urged the reduction of Sardinia, with a view
to open a passage for his troops in Naples to attack Sicily, as
well as to secure a supply of provisions for his armies, a body
of marines was withdrawn from _Tarragona_, a strong sea-port and
garrison in Catalonia, to assist in this enterprise. On the 12th
of August, 1708, the whole arrived before Cagliari, the capital
of Sardinia; and on receiving an equivocal answer to the summons
to surrender, the bombardment commenced on that evening, and
continued, without intermission, until the next morning, when at
the break of day Major-General Wills (thirtieth regiment) and the
whole of the marines, with one Spanish regiment, were landed. The
place, in consequence, almost immediately surrendered.

The whole having been re-embarked, the fleet again set sail on the
18th of August, 1708, for _Minorca_, and arrived at Port Mahon on
the 28th of that month.

At this period _two_ of the Marine regiments were drafted, and
the officers and men were incorporated into the other _four_, now
employed on this service: this measure had become necessary in
order to supply the casualties which had occurred, and to render
these corps effective. For this purpose all the marines capable of
duty, were drawn from the fleet about to return home, in order to
assist in the reduction of an island, which, it was expected, would
make a spirited and tedious defence.

The first attack was against _Fort Fornede_, which was cannonaded
by two of the ships, and surrendered after a contest of four hours;
a detachment having been pushed to _Citadella_ the capital, it
surrendered without resistance:--the batteries were opened on the
works defending the town of _Port Mahon_ on the 17th of September,
when, after a short but brisk fire, and the loss of only six men, a
lodgment was effected under the walls of St. Philip’s Castle; and
on the next day the place surrendered.

Thus was this strong fortress, and the important _Island of
Minorca_, gained by a force of only two thousand four hundred men;
the garrison consisted of one thousand soldiers, with upwards of
one hundred pieces of cannon mounted.

Admiral Sir George Byng arrived at Lisbon on the 14th of October,
from Portsmouth, having Her Majesty the Queen of Portugal on board;
but although many other objects of service were in contemplation,
nothing further was attempted during the remainder of the year 1708.

On the 28th of October, 1708, the decease of His Royal Highness
the Prince George of Denmark, Consort of Her Majesty Queen Anne,
and Lord High Admiral of England, took place.

[Sidenote: 1709]

In the early part of the year 1709 a plan was formed to attack
_Port Royal_ in the province of Nova Scotia, at that time in
possession of the French: for this purpose a body of four hundred
marines was embarked, and the expedition was entrusted to the joint
conduct of Colonel Nicholson of the Marine forces, and Captain
Martin of the Navy. The squadron proceeded for Boston, where they
were reinforced by some ships, and provincial auxiliaries: for this
intended conquest a council of war was held, and arrangements were
made for the debarkation of a body consisting of two thousand five
hundred men, which took place on the 24th of September. On the 1st
of October the Governor surrendered the fortress, and a garrison of
Marines took possession. The fortress was named _Anna-polis Royal_,
in honour of Queen Anne, in whose reign it was conquered.

At this period the prospects of King Charles III. in obtaining
the monarchy of Spain, had become very gloomy and doubtful. The
town of Alicant had sustained along and obstinate siege, against
very powerful forces of Spain and France. The garrison, consisting
principally of Marines, exhibited the most heroic perseverance in
maintaining the place. The fleet under Admiral Sir George Byng, and
the troops on board, under the command of General Stanhope, were to
have attempted its relief, and the squadron was at the same time
to have attacked the enemy’s lines along the sea shore; but the
weather continuing severe, and heavy gales preventing communication
with the town, the Commander-in-Chief deemed it necessary to
propose terms of surrender, and the remainder of the brave troops
were embarked on board of the fleet, which now proceeded to
Tarragona, Port Mahon, and afterwards to Barcelona. During the
remainder of the year 1709, the fleets attempted nothing beyond the
protecting of the convoys of provisions, where they were considered
necessary, and in harassing the commerce of the enemy.

[Sidenote: 1710]

On the 13th of March, 1710, Admiral Sir John Norris arrived at Port
Mahon, as Commander-in-Chief of the Naval forces. After making
arrangements for disposing of the ships and troops in attacks upon
the enemy, he proceeded to Barcelona on the 18th of June, in order
to concert future operations with His Majesty King Charles III.

An expedition was planned against the _Isle of Cette_ in the
province of Languedoc, where the troops and Marines were landed on
the 13th of July. The place made a feeble resistance, and the Fort,
upon which were mounted eighteen pieces of cannon, surrendered on
the same day. The regiment of Stanhope, and three hundred Marines,
advanced against Adge, and the town was delivered up without
resistance.

The Isle of Cette was shortly afterwards recovered by the French
army, under the Duke of Roquetaine; but the British troops had
previously re-embarked.

[Sidenote: 1711]

In the early part of the year 1711 it was resolved to make
an attack on the town of _Quebec_, the capital of the
French possessions in Canada, for which service Admiral Sir
Hovenden Walker and Major-General John Hill were appointed
Commanders-in-Chief; a large fleet of ships of war formed part of
the armament, which was to be further strengthened by troops from
the American colonies; they were directed to proceed to Boston in
New England, and to make arrangements for this undertaking. They
reached Naerlaskel near Boston on the 24th of June, and having
collected the provincial corps, and withdrawn the Marines from
Anna-polis Royal, which had been occupied by these corps since its
surrender in 1709, they sailed for the object of their destination,
after many delays, on the 30th of July.

The expedition did not reach the River St. Lawrence until the 21st
of August, when it encountered storms, and being furnished with
pilots who were unacquainted with the navigation of that river,
eight transports, a store ship, and a sloop were lost by shipwreck,
and upwards of eighty persons, including officers, soldiers, and
women, principally belonging to Colonel Kane’s fourth regiment, and
Colonel Clayton’s thirty-seventh regiment, perished in this fatal
service.

A scarcity of provisions had arisen, and it was then determined
by a council of war that further operations should be abandoned.
Some of the corps proceeded to Anna-polis Royal, and the squadron
returned to England in the month of October, 1711, after having
left the provincial auxiliaries upon their own coast.

On the 17th of April, 1711, the decease of Joseph I., Emperor of
Germany, occurred, and Charles III., of Spain, was elected Emperor
of Germany at Frankfort, by the name of Charles IV., on the 12th
October following. Further attempts on the part of the British
Government, in the cause of King Charles were now unnecessary, as
he was called upon to assume the Imperial throne of his country.
His Majesty embarked at Barcelona, on the 27th of September, on
board of the confederate fleet, and sailed for Italy.

[Sidenote: 1712]

[Sidenote: 1713]

In the year 1712 negotiations were entered into by Great Britain
and France, and peace was restored by the treaty of Utrecht on
the 31st of March, 1713. By this treaty it was settled, that
Great Britain should retain possession of Gibraltar, Minorca, and
Nova Scotia, which had been conquered during the late war, and in
effecting which, the Marine corps, which had been formed during the
reign of Queen Anne, greatly contributed.

[Sidenote: 1714]

On the return of peace, as concluded by the treaty of Utrecht, in
1713, the corps of Marines, which had been formed in the reign of
Queen Anne, were ordered to be disbanded; they were considered to
be part of a war establishment, and a spirit of public economy, as
well as of jealousy against a standing army, particularly in the
early periods after the Revolution of 1688, afforded to the leaders
of parliamentary debates, and of popular prejudices, grounds of
objection to the maintaining of such corps after the termination of
hostilities.

The arrangements consequent on the general peace having been made,
a great reduction in the forces took place. These arrangements had
scarcely been decided, when the decease of Her Majesty Queen Anne
took place on the 1st of August, 1714, and King George the First
ascended the throne.

Soon after His Majesty’s accession, the peace of the kingdom was
disturbed by the hostile designs of King Louis XV. of France, who
had supported and encouraged James Francis Edward Stuart, son of
His late Majesty King James II., in his endeavours to obtain the
throne of Great Britain; but the loyalty of the people, and the
courage of the troops, defeated the attempts for the restoration of
the Stuart family.

King George I., being supported by the parliament, adopted
active measures for increasing his army, and resisting the plans
of his enemies. Six additional regiments of cavalry, from ninth
to fourteenth dragoons, were raised. The establishments of the
regiments of infantry were increased, and in consideration of the
gallant and extensive services of the Marine corps during the late
war, Wills’s, now _thirtieth_, Goring’s, now _thirty-first_, and
Borr’s, now _thirty-second_, were incorporated with the regiments
of infantry of the line, and ranked according to the dates of their
original formation in 1702.

[Sidenote: 1739]

From the year 1714 to 1739 no corps of Marines, except four invalid
companies, were kept on the establishment of the army.

For several years Spain had beheld with great jealousy the growing
commerce and increasing naval consequence of Great Britain,
particularly in the neighbourhood of her possessions in South
America, where Spain had endeavoured to monopolize the whole
commerce and wealth of Mexico and Peru; the vessels of foreign
powers were forbidden, under severe penalties, to approach within
a certain distance of her American possessions; and to enforce
this, the American seas were filled with Spanish cruisers, whose
enormities at length attracted the attention of the British
parliament. After fruitless representations to the court of
Madrid for redress, the British ministry at length determined on
hostilities; and, with the acclamations of the nation, war was
formally declared against Spain on the 23rd of October, 1739.

It was again considered necessary to form an efficient maritime
force in distinct regiments, by which means the corps of the
regular army could be embarked when required for continental
services, and the marine regiments could be employed, either
on board of ships of war, or at the naval stations, as might be
considered best for the public service.

Orders were issued for augmenting the land forces, and also
for forming _six regiments of marines_, each to consist of ten
companies of seventy privates in each company, and to be commanded
by

  1st, Colonel Edward Wolfe, from 3rd Foot Guards;
  2nd, Colonel W. Robinson, from Handasyd’s 22nd regiment;
  3rd, Colonel Andrew Lowther, from 2nd Foot Guards;
  4th, Colonel John Wynyard, from Tyrrell’s regiment;
  5th, Colonel Charles Douglas, from Howard’s regiment;
  6th, Colonel Lucius Ducie Moreton, from 3rd Foot Guards.

In order to facilitate the speedy formation of these corps, and to
render them effective, five men from each company of the regiments
of foot guards were appointed serjeants and corporals; and further,
that they might be rapidly completed, a bounty of thirty shillings
per man was allowed to 1800 men who volunteered from the regiments
of infantry to the marine corps: by these energies, the whole of
the marine regiments were soon raised and disciplined.

On the prospect of the commencement of hostilities Admiral Vernon
had sailed for Jamaica, where he arrived in October, 1739, with a
fleet of five ships, having 200 marines on board, and proceeded
from thence to _Porto Bello_, the destined object of his attach,
which was at that time the great mart for the wealthy commerce of
Chili and Peru; the attempt was fraught with many difficulties, but
it was undertaken and performed with spirit and promptitude.

On the 21st of November, 1739, the attack was commenced by the
ships, in line of battle, against the Iron Castle, a strong
fort at the north point of the entrance into the harbour. The
Spaniards flying from several parts of it, an instant debarkation
of the seamen and marines from on board the Burford, Norwich, and
Worcester took place under cover of those ships, and the fort was
carried. Upon the 22nd an attack was intended against the whole,
but the enemy displayed the white flag as a signal of surrender.
After destroying the fortifications, which from their strength
required some time, the Admiral with his squadron sailed for
Jamaica on the 13th of December, 1739.

[Sidenote: 1740]

In the year 1740 an additional regiment, of four battalions, was
authorised to be raised in America, and the royal standard was
erected at New York, as the signal-post to which every volunteer
marine was to repair. The field officers and subalterns were
appointed by the King, and the captains of companies were nominated
by the American provinces. Colonel Spotswood, of Virginia, was
appointed colonel-commandant of the whole. It was supposed that,
from climate, the natives of that continent were better calculated
for the service to which they were destined, than Europeans. Their
uniform was camblet coats, brown linen waistcoats, and canvas
trousers. This regiment, which was afterwards commanded by Colonel
Gooche, was considered as the FORTY-THIRD regiment of infantry of
the line.

In January, 1740, an augmentation of 340 men, and of one lieutenant
in each company, was made in each of the six regiments of marines,
and twenty men were added to each of the four companies of
invalids, and a similar number to the retired marine establishment.

The utility of the corps of marines was now universally admitted,
and in a letter addressed to the Duke of Newcastle, then first lord
of the treasury and prime minister, by Admiral Vernon, previously
to his sailing with an expedition to the West Indies, he thus
expressed himself on the subject of marine soldiers:--

  “I could wish that we” (alluding to ships of war) “had each a
  company of regular troops on board, which would strengthen us
  in numbers, and their expertness in handling their arms would
  incite our seamen to the imitation of them. If we should come to
  a general war with France as well as Spain, I believe your Grace
  will have already perceived, from the difficulty of manning our
  ships, the necessity of converting most of our marching regiments
  into marines.

  “I have always looked upon our fleet as what must not only
  protect our trade, but secure to us the blessings of a Protestant
  succession, being strongly convinced in my own judgment, that
  preserving a superiority at sea is the best security of His
  Majesty’s government, as well as the trade and prosperity of this
  kingdom.”

The sentiments expressed by Admiral Vernon, in favour of the
marines, were drawn from the acknowledged usefulness of the corps
so employed in the naval expeditions during the reign of Queen Anne.

In the year 1740 _four_ additional regiments of marines were
raised, viz.:--

  7th, Colonel W. Cornwall;
  8th, Colonel W. Hanmore;
  9th, Colonel C. Powlett;
  10th, Colonel J. Jeffreys.

Each regiment consisted of ten companies of 100 men in each
company, which, with officers included, amounted to 1155 in each
regiment. The _six_ regiments raised in 1739 were increased to the
same numbers of officers and men.

In February, 1740, the town of _Carthagena_, the capital of an
extensive and wealthy province in Terra Firma in South America, was
bombarded, and an attack was made upon Chagre, a fort situate upon
the mouth of a river of that name a little to the north-west of
the Gulf of Darien. The latter surrendered, after a sharp contest,
on the 24th of March, when the castle, situated on a rock, and the
custom house under its protection, were demolished and burnt.

These were all that could be performed until the arrival of
reinforcements and supplies from England. The fleet afterwards
returned to Porto Bello, and from thence to Jamaica.

Considerable exertions were made in England during the year
1740 with the view of attacking, more effectually, the Spanish
possessions in South America.

A large number of ships of war was assembled at Spithead under
the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Chaloner Ogle, and a land force,
consisting of Harrison’s (15th) regiment, Wentworth’s (24th)
regiment, and part of Cavendish’s (34th) regiment, was collected in
the Isle of Wight, and held in readiness, with the six regiments
of marines, to be embarked for service under the orders of General
Lord Cathcart, a nobleman of approved courage and experience in war.

The fleet, with the British armament, consisting of one hundred and
seventy ships, sailed from St. Helen’s in October, 1740; but being
overtaken by a tempest in the Bay of Biscay, it was dispersed.
The greater part of the vessels, being re-collected, the Admiral
prosecuted his voyage, and anchored at the neutral island of
Dominica, in order to obtain a supply of wood and water.

Unfortunately for the service, General Lord Cathcart fell an
early victim to the disease of the climate, and the command of the
expedition devolved upon Brigadier-General Thomas Wentworth, of the
24th regiment.

The sixth regiment of foot, under the command of Colonel John
Guise, who was appointed brigadier-general, was subsequently
ordered to proceed to the West Indies to reinforce the troops
employed in this enterprise.

[Sidenote: 1741]

The fleet, under the charge of Rear-Admiral Sir Chaloner Ogle,
arrived at Jamaica in January, 1741, and joined the force under
Vice-Admiral Vernon, who was thus placed at the head of the most
formidable fleet and army which were ever employed in those
seas. The conjoined squadrons consisted of twenty-nine ships of
the line, with nearly an equal number of frigates, fire-ships,
and bomb-ketches, well manned, and plentifully supplied with
provisions, stores, and necessaries. The number of seamen amounted
to 15,000; that of the land forces, including the American regiment
of four battalions (Colonel Spotswood’s) and a body of negroes
enlisted at Jamaica, did not fall short of 12,000.

The whole force sailed from Irish Bay in Hispaniola, and anchored
on the evening of the 4th of March in the _Grande Playa_, to
windward of the town of _Carthagena_, the intended object of the
attack.

The necessary arrangements having been made, the fleet moved
forward in two divisions on the 8th of March, in order to silence
the different forts, preparatory to the landing of the troops.

After about one hour’s cannonade, the forts of _St. Jago_ and _St.
Philip_ were deserted by the enemy, and were taken possession of
by the troops; and by the 15th all the soldiers, with their tents,
tools, artillery, and stores, were landed, the ground cleared, and
an encampment formed.

The reduction of the Castle of _Bocca Chica_ next took place,
which, on a practicable breach being made, it was determined to
storm; but, in consequence of a well-judged diversion of the
navy, the Spaniards retired without firing a shot, and when the
grenadiers advanced to storm at the hour appointed, they met no
resistance.

A panic had seized the enemy, who set fire to one of their ships;
taking advantage of this state, the boats resolved to attempt
the fort of _St. Joseph_, which was immediately evacuated. The
Spaniards appearing to be determined to sink their vessels, the
British crews proceeded to board the ship Galicia, which carried
the flag of the Spanish Admiral.

After various services the castle of _Grande Castello_ was gained,
and the enemy had sunk all their ships of war; preparations were
made for landing the troops near the town, in order to cut off all
communication with the main land.

Two channels having been made through the sunk vessels, with which
the Spaniards had blocked up the entrance of the harbour, the
troops and artillery were re-embarked, and commenced landing on
the 5th of April near the city; and, after a spirited contest, the
British bivouacked within a mile of the castle of _St. Lazar_,
which commanded the town. The men passed three nights in the open
air for want of tents and tools, which could not be landed sooner,
and the health of the troops became seriously injured.

As affairs were now drawing to extremities, and the men were fast
diminishing in numbers from hard duty and the effects of climate,
Brigadier-General Wentworth resolved to attack _St. Lazar_ by
escalade, it being judged necessary to forego the ceremonies of
a regular siege, and, however hazardous, to rest the issue upon a
storm.

Accordingly before daybreak on the 9th of April, a force under the
command of Brigadier-General Guise, of the sixth foot, consisting
of five hundred grenadiers, supported by a thousand Marines, and
some American and Jamaican levies, advanced against the enemy’s
lines in front of the fort; these were followed by a body of
Americans, with woolpacks, scaling-ladders and hand-grenades.

The grenadiers, led by Colonel Grant, of the fifth Marines,
rushed forward with astonishing bravery, and, leaping into the
entrenchments, carried the works in gallant style, driving the
Spaniards into the fort over a drawbridge which communicated with
the lines. Colonel Grant fell mortally wounded, and the troops,
after sustaining a most destructive fire for several hours with
intrepidity and perseverance, were ordered to retreat, having lost
many officers, and 600 men in killed and wounded.

This repulse was succeeded by the violent periodical rains; the
country was deluged with water; and the change of atmosphere, which
is always attended with epidemical diseases, produced the most
fatal effects. The troops were so drenched with rain, and their
health so seriously impaired, that all hope of further success
vanished; they were accordingly re-embarked, and the forts and
castle of the harbour of _Carthagena_ having been demolished, the
fleet sailed for Jamaica on the 6th of May, where it arrived on the
9th of that month. After re-embarking, the distempers, peculiar to
the climate, produced numerous casualties among the troops.

Thus terminated, for the time, the expedition to Spanish South
America, during which the persevering and undaunted bravery of
British Seamen, Soldiers, and Marines, and their patient endurance
under the most trying difficulties, were never displayed in a
greater degree.

In consequence of the heavy losses sustained at _Carthagena_, and
the mortality which continued to prevail after the troops returned
to Jamaica, it was not until the beginning of July, 1741, that the
fleet and army were in a condition to renew their operations. It
was then resolved to proceed against the _Island of Cuba_, where
they anchored on the 18th of July in Waltenham Bay, about eighteen
leagues to windward of _St. Jago_, the first object of their
intended attack. The troops were landed on the 24th, consisting of
nearly 4,000 men, including 1000, negroes raised by the Island of
Jamaica, with a view to sustain the peculiar duties of fatigue,
naturally expected to arise on this service.

After establishing a position on the side of the river, nearly
three leagues from the mouth of the harbour, the General pushed
some detachments into the country, which beat back the outposts of
the enemy, and in a few days returned to the camp with plentiful
supplies of provisions.

It was originally intended by the Commanders-in-Chief to have made
a joint attack upon _St. Jago_, but the want of unanimity ruined
every purpose, and contentious debates and dilatory measures,
instead of cordial co-operation and daring enterprise, took place;
while the interests of the country, and the lives of the troops,
were sacrificed to the prejudices and bad judgment of the officers
entrusted with so important a command.

After an interval of several months, during which nothing was
attempted towards effecting the conquest of the island, and when
sickness, the never-failing result of inactivity, particularly in
those climes, began its ravages, it was determined to evacuate the
island, which took place on the 20th of November, 1741, when the
regimental Returns were as follow:--

  +-----------------------------------------------+--------------+

The total loss of officers at the close of 1741 amounted to one
Commander-in-Chief, five colonels, ten lieut.-colonels, seven
majors, fifty-five captains, one hundred and sixteen subalterns,
and fourteen staff officers.

The heavy casualties in the Marine regiments are shown when it is
stated that these six regiments consisted of more than one thousand
men each, and that, only 2654 men returned.

The foregoing statement affords a sad record of the ill-judged
plans relating to the expedition to South America, both as to the
season of the year at which it was undertaken, and the deficiency
of means and arrangements with which it was attempted to be carried
into execution. Great disappointment and dissatisfaction were
consequently created in the feelings of the British public.

The transports returned to Jamaica on the 29th of November, 1741,
and the squadron continued at sea to meet the reinforcements which
were anxiously expected from England.

[Sidenote: 1742]

In January 1742, nearly 3000 men, including 2000 Marines, arrived
at Jamaica. Another expedition was now meditated, which put to sea
early in March; but adverse winds, the separation of the transports
having on board the working negroes, and the expectation of the
periodical rains being then about to set in, suggested to a Council
of War, held at Porto Bello, at the close of that month, the
immediate return of the whole armament to the port they had left:
the fleet arrived at Jamaica upon the 15th of May.

It was now considered desirable to detach a force to take
possession of _Rattan_, an island in the Bay of Honduras, and a
situation proper for maintaining a commercial intercourse with
South America, as well as the trade in logwood. An establishment
having been formed there in the early part of the year, it was
determined in a Council of War to send a force of 50 marines and
200 Americans, under Major Caulfield, in order to place the island
in a state of military defence.

On the 23rd of August the troops reached _Port Royal_, on the
south side of the island, where they formed a camp and erected
_Fort George_ to defend the harbour, as well as _Fort Frederick_
on the western part of it. A proportion of the Americans, who were
papists, formed a plot to render the settlement abortive, and to
rise upon the Marines. Her Majesty’s ship, the Litchfield, then in
the harbour, hearing the alarm-guns, instantly landed her party
of Marines, who, with those on shore, soon checked the daring
mutiny, secured the delinquents, and preserved the settlement to
the British Crown.

At this period it was necessary to detach 500 men to the assistance
of _General Oglethorpe_, in _South Carolina_, and to repel the
menaces of the Spaniards against the infant colony of _Georgia_.[45]

On the 23rd of September orders arrived at Jamaica for the recall
of Admiral Vernon and of General Wentworth; for providing the fleet
with a number of men from the Marines, sufficient to supply its
wants; and also to fill up the vacancies in the eight Independent
Companies raised for the defence of Jamaica (now the 49th
Regiment):--These services absorbed all the men who were considered
fit for duty, and the remainder were embarked for England.

After the departure of Admiral Vernon, the Naval Command devolved
on Sir Chaloner Ogle, who bore his testimony to the zeal and
bravery of the troops, whose gallant efforts and patient endurance,
under great privations, had been conspicuous throughout a series
of misfortunes. Upwards of 7000 Marines and nearly 4000 other
troops were the lamentable victims to pestilence and disease, but
not to defeat; and the objects which had been effected, although
not adequate to the hopes and expectations of the British Nation,
were distressing to the enemy, and embarrassing to the Spanish
Government.

[Sidenote: 1743]

In the early part of 1743 it was resolved to make another attempt
upon the continent of South America, and the conduct of the
operations was entrusted to Captain Knowles, of the Navy, who
had on board of his squadron 400 of _Dalzell’s_ (thirty-eighth)
_regiment_ and about _six hundred Marines_. They were first ordered
to rendezvous at Antigua, from which island they sailed on the 12th
of February with a view to an attack upon La Guira, a town in the
district of the Caraccas in Terra Firma. The attack was commenced
on the 18th, but, owing to a heavy swell, the ships could not
approach the shore, and the troops were consequently not landed.
After a heavy cannonade, which was ended only by the night, the
ships withdrew from the combat: the town suffered extremely, many
breaches being made in the fortifications; and the enemy sustained
a loss of more than 700 men. The British squadron suffered
considerable damage, and had nearly 400 men killed and wounded.

The fleet proceeded to Curaçao to refit, where preparations were
made for another attempt upon the sea-coast of Terra Firma. Having
been reinforced by some Dutch volunteers, Commodore Knowles sailed
from this island on the 20th of March, and steered for _Porto
Cavallo_, a town having a respectable force, and being in a good
state of defence.

On the 15th of April the ships anchored to the eastward of the
town, and on the 16th two vessels commenced a flanking fire against
_Ponta Brava_; and after the batteries were silenced, it was
decided to land the troops in order to take possession, and to turn
the guns against the castle, their retreat being secured by a ship
of war within pistol-shot, of the shore: by sunset the ships had
accomplished their object, and by dusk a force of 1200 sailors,
soldiers, and Dutch volunteers, was disembarked under the command
of Major Lucas.

About eleven at night the van had gained one of the fascine
batteries upon Ponta Brava, but the garrison having been alarmed,
and being prepared for resistance, this mixed detachment acted
under the influence of a panic, and retreated with precipitation to
the ships. On the 21st it was resolved to make another attack of
the squadron and forces against the castle and fascine batteries:
four ships were destined to batter the former on the 24th, while
three others were placed against the latter. The cannonading began
at eleven on the noon of that day, and was maintained with mutual
obstinacy till night, when, some of the ships having expended
their ammunition, and others being damaged, they were ordered
to anchor beyond reach of the enemy’s shot. This attack being
fruitless, and the troops being prevented from landing, it was
deemed impracticable to push the enterprise any further: it was
accordingly resolved on the 28th of April to return to Jamaica.

From the period of the commencement of hostilities against Spain in
1739, the conduct of the Court of Versailles had been equivocal,
and in the beginning of the year 1743 the projects of Louis XV.
were developed by the equipment of powerful naval armaments in the
ports of France, and by the assembling of armies on the sea-coasts,
the avowed aim of which was against the Crown and liberties of the
British Empire.

Being no longer able to restrain her views, France declared war on
the 20th of March, 1743, which was answered by a proclamation on
the part of Great Britain on the 31st of that month.

[Sidenote: 1744]

A force of 11,550 Marines was granted by Parliament as a part of
the establishment for the year 1744, at which period fleets were
detached to every quarter of the globe. A partial affair occurred
in the Mediterranean in May of this year, in which a party of
Marines disembarked from the Essex ship-of-war, and signalized
themselves: that ship being on a cruise gained sight of twenty-six
xebeques and settees, bound to Antibes, from whence they were to
carry troops to Italy: the former were a convoy to the latter,
which were laden with powder, cannon, ordnance stores, and
provisions: thirteen having taken refuge in the Creek of Casse, the
Marines were landed in order to co-operate with the boats, and to
repel any enemy that might appear to retard their progress: they
were attacked by a body of Spaniards, whom they beat back, and thus
effected the object on which they were employed: eleven vessels
were burnt and two captured.

The most active measures were adopted, by order of the Secretary at
War, for again completing the ten regiments of Marines, in order to
render them effective as speedily as possible.

[Sidenote: 1745]

Attacks having been made during the last year by the French upon
_Canso_ and _Anna-polis_ in _Nova Scotia_, the former of which they
burnt, the Northern Colonies of British America became alarmed for
their safety: an expedition was consequently commenced against
_Louisburg_; considerable levies were raised in the American
provinces, and a co-operating naval force, under Commodore Warren,
then commanding on the West India station, was ordered to repair
to Canso; the arrangements made for conducting this expedition
were carried into effect with that confidence and secrecy which
are always essential towards securing the success of a military
enterprise, and the exertions of the Americans were fully equal to
the important interests which they had at stake.

On the 4th of April the levies from New England, having reached
_Canso_, were encamped and brought into military order and
discipline preparatory to the arrival of other corps from the
several provinces, while the ships of war upon the coast, and some
stout privateers, continued off the harbour of _Louisburg_, in
order to cut off all intelligence of the projected enterprise. On
the 23rd of April Commodore Warren arrived at _Canso_, and by the
29th all the land forces were embarked, and proceeded to _Gabaras
Bay_, about four miles from the capital of _Cape Breton_.

On the 30th of April 2000 men were landed at noon, who beat
back a detachment of troops which was sent to prevent their
disembarkation. On that and the following day three hundred seamen
and _five hundred Marines_ were disembarked under cover of the
vessels ranged along the coast. The troops were under the command
of Brigadier-General William Pepperell, a native of Piccataway, and
Colonel of American Militia.

The French, conscious of the strength of their positions,
maintained possession of the city until their means of defence were
overpowered by the forces brought against them.

By indefatigable labour, the British Marines, and the American
provincials, succeeded in effecting an entrance into the harbour
on the 1st of June, 1745; _Louisburg_ capitulated, and with it the
whole dependency of _Cape Breton_; the object was attained with a
loss little exceeding 100 men.[46]

Two regiments were formed for service at Cape Breton, by Colonel
William Shirley and Sir William Pepperell, each consisting of ten
companies of 100 men per company: these were numbered the 50th and
51st regiments of infantry of the line.

[Sidenote: 1746]

In the year 1746 very serious complaints were made of the neglect
and delay which had occurred in the settlement of the accounts of
the Marine Corps, and a committee was appointed to investigate
the grievances which had been represented. The cause of the delay
was alleged to arise, in the first instance, from the absence of
regular and periodical muster-rolls, according to the practice in
regiments of the regular army. This system, it was stated, could
not easily be acted upon in the corps of Marines, who were employed
by detachments in the several ships of war. The investigation
produced, however, the effect of a large balance in the hands of
the Paymaster-General being repaid into the Bank of England, for
the benefit of those who were justly entitled to it.

The privations and inconveniences, which this meritorious body of
troops had continued to endure for several years, did not affect
their loyalty and steady allegiance, and they still remained the
useful corps, in periods of emergency, they had always proved in
former years.

For the service of this year (1746) nearly 12,000 Marines were
included in the parliamentary vote of the military establishment.
An expedition against Quebec was contemplated at this period, and
a considerable force was assembled at Spithead with that intent,
but delays took place until the season for such an attempt became
too late. Of this force Colonel Powlett’s (the ninth) regiment of
Marines formed a part.

The troops were afterwards destined against _Port L’Orient_, under
the directions of Admiral Lestock and Lieut.-General Sinclair.
Sixteen sail of the line and eight frigates, with 5000 troops,
exclusive of Marines, were the number employed on this occasion.
The long detention of so respectable a force until the period of
the equinox, endangered its progress along a hostile coast at so
critical a season, and gave time for the enemy to ascertain the
object of the expedition.

The fleet sailed from Plymouth on the 14th of September for the
coast of Brittany, and a debarkation of the troops was effected on
the 20th of that month, in _Quimperlay Bay_: on the 21st the troops
advanced in two columns against _Plymeur_, which surrendered, and
on the following day the whole moved on to a rising ground within
a mile of _Port L’Orient_, the ultimate object of their views.
Some affairs took place between the 21st and 26th of September,
when after a cannonade, which did considerable damage to the town,
a retreat was commenced under cover of the night. The French were
pouring in from all quarters, and the situation of the British
troops became critical.

After a loss of 150 men killed, wounded, and missing, a
re-embarkation was effected, and the fleet sailed on the 1st of
October for the Bay of Borneuff, off Quiberon, to the south of
Quimperlay: a detachment of Marines was entrenched at Quimperlay
to guard the landing-place; the remainder, under Colonel Holmes,
was united with the army: some troops were landed on the 4th of
October on the peninsula of Quiberon, and, after remaining ashore
some days, the whole returned to England.

[Sidenote: 1747]

The number of Marines for the year 1747 was eleven thousand one
hundred and fifty, as included in the parliamentary vote of that
year.

On the 28th of February, 1747, His Majesty King George II.
directed, that the several regiments of Marines, which were then
existing, or might hereafter be raised, should be placed under the
entire command of the Lords Commissioners for executing the office
of High Admiral of Great Britain and Ireland.

The following Royal Warrant was issued on this subject:--

  “_To Our Commissioners for executing the office of High Admiral
  of Our Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; and to Our
  Commissioners for executing the office of our High Admiral for
  the time being._”

  (Copy)

  “Whereas We have thought it necessary for the good of Our Service
  to put under your immediate and entire command all our Marine
  regiments now raised, or hereafter to be raised; Our Will and
  Pleasure therefore is, that you do lake upon you the immediate
  and entire command of the said Marine forces accordingly; and
  for the better government of our said Marine regiments, we have
  thought fit to empower and authorise you to prepare and publish
  such rules and ordinances as are fit to be observed by our said
  Marine forces under your command, hereby strictly charging and
  requiring the several colonels and other officers, who shall
  from time to time be employed in the said regiments, to take
  notice thereof, and in all respects to conform themselves to
  such directions accordingly, and to cause exact musters to be
  taken of them, as well at sea as on shore, and that the same
  be transmitted to our Commissary-General of Marines, in order
  to the more speedy clearing of the accounts of our said Marine
  regiments. And whereas, by the establishment, provision is made
  for such contingent charges as may arise in this service, and to
  the use of our said forces, you are hereby further authorized
  to direct the payment of the said money, in such proportions as
  you shall, in your discretion, think necessary, for the purpose
  aforesaid.

  “And for executing the several powers and authorities herein
  expressed this shall be your warrant. And so we bid you heartily
  farewell.

      “Given at our Court at St. James’s, this 28th
      February, 1746-7, in the 20th year of
      our reign.

      “By His Majesty’s Command.
      (Signed)      “CHESTERFIELD.”

Notwithstanding the disasters which had attended the expeditions
of the French in North America in the preceding year (1746), when
Louis XV. had equipped an extensive armament, under the command
of the Duke d’Anville for the recapture of Cape Breton, which was
rendered ineffectual by storms and other casualties, and by the
death of its commander, the French Monarch was not discouraged by
these disasters; but was resolved to renew his efforts against the
British colonies in North America, and also the settlements in the
East Indies. For these purposes two squadrons were prepared at
Brest, one commanded by Commodore de la Jonquière, and the other,
destined for India, by Monsieur de St. George.

Intelligence had been received by the British Government of these
preparations, and measures were adopted in order to counteract the
views of the enemy. The occasion afforded a renewed display of
the zeal and intrepidity of Vice-Admiral Anson and Rear-Admiral
Warren, who sailed from Plymouth on the 9th of April, in order to
intercept both squadrons, which were to set sail together. The
Vice-Admiral, on board of the “Prince George” of ninety guns, with
the Rear-Admiral, on board the “Devonshire,” and twelve ships more
under his command, received directions to cruise between Ushant and
Cape Finisterre on the coast of Galicia.

On the 3rd of May, 1747, they fell in with the French squadrons,
consisting of six large ships of war, as many frigates, and four
armed vessels equipped by the French East India Company, having
under their convoy about thirty ships laden with merchandize: those
prepared for war immediately shortened sail, and formed in line of
battle, while the rest, under the protection of the six frigates,
proceeded on their voyage with all the sail they could carry.
The British squadron was likewise drawn up in line of battle,
and the engagement began with great fury about four o’clock in
the afternoon. The enemy’s ships sustained the battle with equal
conduct and valour, until they were overpowered by numbers, and
they then struck their colours. About seven hundred of the French
were killed and wounded in this action; the English lost about
five hundred; and among them Captain Grenville, Commander of the
ship “Defiance,” nephew to Lord Viscount Cobham, an officer of the
most promising genius, and animated with the noblest sentiments of
honour and patriotism. Two of these prizes were the “_Invincible_”
and the “_Glory_,” which induced the Captain of the former to say
to the Admiral, on giving up his sword, “Sir, you have conquered
the _Invincible_, and _Glory_ follows you.” This blow was severely
felt by France, who had vainly flattered herself, that by means of
this armament she should render herself mistress of the Indian
seas, and by that superiority be enabled to wrest from the British
their most valuable possessions in that part of the world.

A considerable quantity of money, intended to answer the
contingencies of these expeditions, was found on board of the
French ships, which were brought to Spithead, and the treasure,
being landed, was conveyed in twenty waggons to the Bank of
England, escorted by a party of Marines, amidst the acclamations of
the populace.

For this achievement Vice-Admiral George Anson was created a Peer
of Great Britain, and Rear-Admiral Peter Warren was invested with
the Order of the Bath. The whole fleet received the thanks of the
Sovereign, through their Commander, Admiral Lord Anson.

The year 1747 was remarkable for other naval successes; about the
middle of June, COMMODORE FOX, with six ships of war, cruising in
the latitude of Cape Ortegal, in Galicia, took about forty French
ships, richly laden from St. Domingo, after they had been abandoned
by their convoy.

The fourteenth of October, 1747, was rendered memorable as another
day of triumph for the British Navy. REAR-ADMIRAL EDWARD HAWKE
sailed from Plymouth in the beginning of August, with fourteen
ships of the line, with instructions to intercept a fleet of
French merchant-ships bound for the West Indies: the British fleet
cruised for some time on the coast of Bretagne, and the French
ships sailed from the isle of Aix under convoy of nine ships of
the line, besides frigates, commanded by M. de l’Etendiere. The
two squadrons came in sight of each other in the latitude of
Belle Isle. The battle commenced about eleven in the forenoon,
and lasted until night, when all the French squadron, except two
ships, the “Intrepide” and “Tonnant,” which escaped in the dark,
had struck to the English flag. After despatching a sloop to
Commodore Legge, commanding a squadron in the Leeward Islands, to
take proper measures to intercept the French ships in the passage
to Martinique, and other French islands, ADMIRAL HAWKE conducted
his prizes to Spithead, and was rewarded with the Order of the
Bath; and the thanks of a grateful country were rendered to all the
officers, seamen, and Marines of the squadron.

In the latter part of 1747, _Admiral Boscawen_ had sailed from
England with a fleet of ships, and a number of Marines, and other
forces, in order to reinforce the British fleet in the East Indies,
with instructions to make an attack upon the _Island of Mauritius_,
and subsequently to effect the conquest of _Pondicherry_, which was
the chief object of the expedition.

After having reconnoitred the coast of the Mauritius, it was
ascertained that the powerful means of defence everywhere
presented, and the dangers in many places of approaching the
land, would involve a great sacrifice of men, and render success
ultimately doubtful; the coming on of the autumnal monsoons had
also an influence in the decision of a council, which was to
relinquish the attempt, and to proceed without delay for the _Coast
of Coromandel_, according to the prescribed plan of operations.

[Sidenote: 1748]

About the end of June, 1748, the Admiral quitted the Coasts of the
Mauritius, and proceeded to _Fort St. David_, where the troops were
landed, and encamped with all the necessary stores; the Marines
from four ships sent to Europe under Admiral Griffin, were added
to the battalion employed on this service. The forces employed
amounted to six thousand British and Native Auxiliary troops, and
upwards of one thousand sailors, trained to the use of small arms,
who were to form the besieging army. The battering cannon, mortars,
and every implement were conveyed by the squadron within two miles
of the town, while the land forces marched on the 8th of August
towards _Pondicherry_, about thirty miles distant.

After several unsuccessful attempts, the troops crossed the river
of _Arian Coupan_, and obtained possession of a strong situation
within a mile of that Fort; a communication was maintained from
thence with the fleet; and all the implements necessary for the
siege were landed.

On the 25th of September the batteries were completed, and began
to play; but, notwithstanding a combined cannonade on the part
of the squadron against the town, it was found that the enemy’s
fire gained an ascendency over the besiegers. The fatigues endured
by the troops, sickness becoming prevalent, and the rainy season
being daily expected, which would inundate the country, and render
retreat impracticable, afforded strong grounds, on which a Council
of War, held on the 30th of September, determined to abandon
the siege, to re-embark the men and stores, and to destroy the
batteries. The troops fortunately reached Fort St. David on the
evening of the 7th of October, after having demolished the fort of
_Arian Coupan_ on their way; the heavy rains which fell on the same
evening had nearly rendered the rivers impassable.

On the 13th of February, 1748, the British squadron in the West
Indies sailed from Jamaica under the command of Rear-Admiral
Knowles, on an expedition against St. Jago, in Cuba, for which
purpose some land forces were embarked at Jamaica, and being
joined with the Marines of the squadron, the whole put to sea; but
after persevering for some time against strong northerly winds,
which prevented their approaching that coast, the design was
given up, and the force was directed against _Port Louis_, on the
south side of Hispaniola, before which place it arrived on the
8th of March. The service was performed by the ships in line of
battle, which, after three hours’ heavy cannonade, compelled the
governor, M. de Chaleaunoye, to surrender, when Major Scott, with a
detachment of Colonel Trelawny’s, the forty-ninth regiment, and the
Marines, were landed, and took possession of the Fort in the name
of His Majesty. After having shipped or destroyed upwards of eighty
heavy cannon, and blown up the works, the whole were re-embarked;
and Rear-Admiral Knowles resumed his former design against St.
Jago, where he arrived on the 5th of April. The Plymouth and
Cornwall were ordered to enter the harbour, but after firing a few
broadsides at the castle, it was considered prudent to desist, and
the squadron returned to Jamaica.

The distresses of France arising from the destruction of her Navy,
and the annihilation of her commerce, compelled King Louis XV. to
express a desire for peace. Accordingly, a congress was held at
_Aix-la-Chapelle_, in order to negotiate the terms on which peace
could be restored. The desire expressed by the King of France, as
well as of Spain, did not, however, induce the British Government
to relax in its efforts to reduce the means which those powers
never failed to use, when opportunities offered, of thwarting the
measures of Great Britain.

The negotiations, commenced at Aix-la-Chapelle in June, 1748,
produced a Definitive Treaty of Peace, which was concluded on the
18th of October of that year, and was proclaimed on the 2nd of
February, 1749.

Among the many reductions which took place during 1748, consequent
on the General Peace, the Ten regiments of Marines were disbanded
in November of that year, the officers of which were placed on
half-pay.

[Sidenote: 1755]

The conditions of the Peace concluded with France in 1748, were
broken as soon as that Power had recovered from the effects of the
former war: the interval of six years had been devoted to extending
her Naval preparations, and to negotiations with other States, in
order to reduce, or destroy, the power of Great Britain.

After enduring many insults, and witnessing the hostile measures
which were preparing in the ports of France, the energies of the
British nation were again aroused, and in the spring of 1755
considerable augmentations were made in the Army and Navy, and
fifty companies of Marines were directed to be raised and placed
under the control of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.
These companies were formed into three Divisions, and stationed at
Chatham, Portsmouth, and Plymouth, and an Act of Parliament was
passed for the “Regulation of the Marine forces while on shore.”[47]

From the 5th of April, 1755, the Marine corps have constituted a
branch of the permanent national force, and have been provided for
in the annual votes of the House of Commons, on distinct estimates
produced at each session, of the Navy, Army, and Marines.


War was declared against France on the 18th May in the following
year (1756).

       *       *       *       *       *

The foregoing pages contain accounts of the services of the _Corps
of Marines_ from the earliest period of their formation, to the
year 1748, when they ceased to form a portion of the establishment
of the Army. These historical details afford numerous instances
in which the gallant exertions of the Marines have materially
contributed to the successes obtained by the Navy and Army, and to
the honours and advantages which have resulted from their combined
operations.

The services of the present Marine forces have been, as in former
years, highly useful and efficient, and by their uniformly good
conduct they have obtained the approbation of the Sovereign, and
the confidence of the Country.

[Sidenote: 1802]

As a lasting mark of approbation, His Majesty King George III. was
pleased, in 1802, to direct that they should be styled “_The Royal
Marines_,” as announced in the following Order, issued by the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty, and inserted in the London Gazette,
dated

      “_Admiralty Office, 29th April, 1802._

  “His Majesty has been graciously pleased to signify His Commands,
  that, in consideration of the very meritorious services of the
  Marines during the late War, the Corps shall in future be styled
  ‘THE ROYAL MARINES.’

      “By Command of their Lordships.
      (Signed)      “EVAN NEPEAN.”


On acquiring the title of _Royal_, the facings of the Marines,
which had been _White_, were changed to _Blue_, as in other Royal
corps of Infantry.[48]

[Sidenote: 1827]

On the 26th of September, 1827, New Colours were presented to the
Division of Royal Marines at Chatham, on the part of His Majesty
King George IV., by His Royal Highness the Duke of Clarence,
then Lord High Admiral of Great Britain, and General of Marines,
afterwards King William IV.

After alluding to the services of Marine regiments from the period
of their formation to the present time, His Royal Highness caused
the New Colours to be unfurled, and concluded his address in the
following terms:

  “His Majesty has selected for the Royal Marines a _Device_, to
  which their achievements have entitled them, and which, by his
  permission, I this day present to you;--a _Badge_ which you
  have so hardly and honorably earned:--From the difficulty of
  selecting any particular places to inscribe on these Standards,
  your Sovereign has been pleased to adopt ‘_The Great Globe
  itself_,’ as the most proper and distinctive badge. He has also
  directed, that his own name (_George IV._) shall be added to that
  peculiar badge, THE ANCHOR, which is your distinctive bearing,
  in order that it may be known hereafter, that GEORGE THE FOURTH
  had conferred on you the honorable and well-earned badge this day
  presented to you.

  “The motto, peculiarly your own, ‘_Per Mare; Per Terram_,’ has
  been allowed to remain; and surmounting the entire is the word
  GIBRALTAR, in commemoration of the important national services
  you performed there. In presenting these Colours, the gift of
  your Sovereign, into your hands, I trust,--I am confident,--you
  will defend them with the same intrepidity, loyalty, and
  regard for the interests of the country, that have marked your
  preservation of your old ones; and if you do, your Sovereign, and
  your Country, will have equal reason to be satisfied.”

FOOTNOTES:

[44] By Order in Council, dated 26th October, 1604, it was
directed, that twelve hundred land-soldiers should be raised, in
order to be in readiness for distribution in His Majesty’s fleets;
the whole to form one regiment, of six companies, under a Colonel,
with a Lieutenant-Colonel, and Serjeant-Major; each company
consisted of two hundred soldiers, with a captain, lieutenant,
ensign, drummer, four serjeants, and four corporals. The regiment
was armed with firelocks.

A subsequent Order in Council, dated 1st April, 1668, authorised
the drawing of such numbers of soldiers from the Foot Guards, for
His Majesty’s service at sea, during the summer, as the Lord High
Admiral might require.

[45] In 1732 trustees were appointed by charter to superintend
a new settlement in _Georgia_, situated to the southward of
_Carolina_ in America, and _Mr. James Oglethorpe_, General and
Governor of the Province, embarked at Gravesend with a number of
poor families to plant that Colony. In 1737, when the King of Spain
claimed as part of his territories, the Colony of Georgia, which
was considered to belong to Great Britain, General Oglethorpe was
authorised to raise a regiment of six companies of 100 men each,
for the defence of the settlement. The colonies of Georgia and
Carolina had been named from King George II., and his consort Queen
Caroline.

[46] Cape Breton was restored to the French after the peace of
Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. It was retaken in 1758 by Admiral Boscawen
and General Sir Jeffery Amherst, and finally ceded to Great Britain
at the peace of 1763.

[47] A _Fourth_ Division was added to the Establishment of the
Royal Marines, by Order in Council dated 15th August, 1805, and
stationed at Woolwich.

[48] The LAUREL was authorised to be borne as a testimony of the
gallantry of the Marines at the siege of Belle-Isle in the year
1761, and is encircled about the figure of the GLOBE on the Colours.




APPENDIX TO THE MARINE CORPS.


The following memoranda are appended to this narrative of the
services of the Royal Marines, in order to show the relative
positions in which the Marine regiments were placed, in respect to
_rank and precedence_, with the regiments of Infantry, during the
period the Marine regiments were borne on the establishment of the
regular army, and the ground on which the present corps of Royal
Marines have been authorised, when acting with the infantry of the
line, to take their station next to the _Forty-ninth_ regiment,
according to the date of their formation in the year 1755, as shown
in the following pages.

The rank of the several regiments of the British army was first
regulated by a Board of General Officers assembled in the
Netherlands, by command of King William III., on the 10th June,
1694.

Another Board of General Officers was assembled by order of Queen
Anne, in 1713, to decide on the rank and precedence of regiments
raised subsequently to 1694.

A third Board was assembled, by command of King George I., in 1715,
for the same purpose.

These Boards recommended that English regiments raised in England,
should take rank from the dates of their formation, and that
English, Scots, and Irish regiments, raised for the service of
a foreign power, should take rank from the dates of their being
placed on the English establishment.

The _Numerical Titles_ of regiments, as fixed on the principle
laid down in the reports of the Boards of General Officers, above
alluded to, were confirmed by the warrant issued by authority of
King George II., dated 1st July, 1751,--and also by the warrant of
King George III., dated 19th December, 1768, previously to which
periods regiments were generally designated by the names of their
Colonels.

1. The principle on which the Numerical Titles of regiments were
fixed, having been thus established by Royal authority, the
regiments of infantry which had been formed by King Charles II.,
on his Restoration to the Throne in 1660, and those which had been
subsequently raised in the reigns of King James II. and of William
III., were numbered according to the dates of being placed on the
English establishment,--from the _First_, or _Royal_, regiment to
the _Twenty-seventh_ regiment.

2. The regiments of infantry, which had been added to the army in
the reign of Queen Anne from the year 1702, and retained on the
establishment after the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, commenced with
the _Twenty-eighth_, and ended with the _Thirty-ninth_ regiment.

3. The _Fortieth_ regiment was formed in the year 1717, from
independent companies in North America and the West Indies:--the
command was conferred on Colonel Richard Philips.

4. The _Forty-first_ regiment was formed from Invalids in
1719:--the command was conferred on Colonel Edmund Fielding.

5. The other regiments of infantry, raised by King George I. on the
augmentation of the army in the year 1715, were disbanded in 1718,
after the Monarchy, in the line of the House of Brunswick, had been
established, and the Peace of the Kingdom restored.

6. The _Forty-second Highland_ regiment was formed in the reign of
King George II. from independent companies in Scotland, in the year
1739. It was originally termed “_The Black Watch_” and was placed
on the establishment on the 25th October, 1739:--the command was
conferred on Colonel James Earl of Crawford.[49]

7. The _Forty-third_ regiment was raised for service in America,
in the year 1740, by Colonel Andrew Spotswood, and afterwards
commanded by Colonel W. Gooche. It was disbanded in 1743.

8. The Ten regiments of Marines raised in 1739 and 1740, were
numbered from the 44th to the 53rd regiments, as shown in the
following list, viz.:--

The above ten regiments were disbanded in November, 1748.

9. The following seven regiments were raised, and added to the
establishment of the army, in January, 1741; and in consequence
of the disbandment of Colonel Spotswood’s, afterwards Gooche’s,
American Provincials, and also of the ten regiments of Marines, the
_numerical_ titles of six of these regiments were changed, after
the peace of 1748, as specified in the following list; viz.:--

  54th Regt., com. by Colonel Thomas Fowke, now the 43rd Regt.
  55th  ”          ”          James Long,       ”   44th Regt.
  56th  ”          ”          D. Houghton,      ”   45th Regt.
  57th  ”          ”          James Price,      ”   46th Regt.
  58th  ”          ”          J. Mordaunt,      ”   47th Regt.
  59th  ”          ”          J. Cholmondeley,  ”   48th Regt.
  60th  ”          ”          H. De Grangue, disbanded in 1748.

10. The _Forty-ninth_ regiment was formed in the year 1743, of
two companies of one of the regiments raised in the reign of
Queen Anne, which had remained at Jamaica, and of six other
companies formed in that colony. The command was given to Colonel
Edward Trelawny, then Governor of Jamaica. It was retained on
the establishment after the peace of 1748, and numbered the 49th
regiment.

11. On the recommencement of hostilities with France in 1755, fifty
companies of Marines were raised, under the direction and control
of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. These companies were
formed into _three divisions_, at the principal naval stations,
Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Chatham.[50] The _Corps of Marines_
having been raised in 1755, and since that period retained on the
establishment, as a branch of the permanent national force of
Navy, Army, and Marines, have been authorised to rank, when acting
with infantry of the line, _next to the forty-ninth Regiment_, as
directed by His Majesty King George IV. in the following General
Order, dated

      “_Horse-Guards, 30th March, 1820._

  “In reference to the _Regulations regarding Precedence of
  Regiments_ (as contained in page 10 of the General Regulations
  and Orders of the Army), His Majesty has been graciously pleased
  to command, that the _Royal Marines_, when acting with the Troops
  of the Line, shall take their station next to the forty-ninth
  Regiment.

      “By Command of H. R. H. the Commander-in-Chief.
      “HENRY TORRENS, _Adjutant-General_.”


12. In the year 1745 two regiments were raised for service in
North America, by Colonel William Shirley and Colonel Sir William
Pepperell. In 1754 they were numbered the 50th and 51st Regiments.

13. In December, 1755, eleven regiments were raised and added
to the establishment of the army; and in consequence of the
disbandment of Colonel Shirley’s and Sir William Pepperell’s
regiments in 1757, the eleven regiments, above alluded to, were
ranked two numbers higher in the list of regiments of infantry, as
shown in the following list; viz.:--

  52nd Regt., com. by  Colonel James Abercromby now the 50th Regt.
  53rd  ”          ”           Robt. Napier        ”    51st Regt.
  54th  ”          ”           H. Lambton          ”    52nd Regt.
  55th  ”          ”           W. Whitmore         ”    53rd Regt.
  56th  ”          ”           John Campbell       ”    54th Regt.
  57th  ”          ”           G. Perry            ”    55th Regt.
  58th  ”          ”           Lord C. Manners     ”    56th Regt.
  59th  ”          ”           John Arabin         ”    57th Regt.
  60th  ”          ”           Robt. Anstruther    ”    58th Regt.
  61st  ”          ”           Charles Montagu     ”    59th Regt.
  62nd Royal American,  } Col. The Earl of Loudon. ”    60th Regt.
  of _four_ battalions, }

14. In April, 1758, the _Second Battalions_ of the fifteen
regiments, undermentioned, were formed into distinct regiments, and
numbered as shown in the following list; viz.:--

   3rd Foot, 2d Batt., const^d     61st Regt.
   4th Foot,   ”         ”         62nd Regt.
   8th Foot,   ”         ”         63rd Regt.
  11th Foot,   ”         ”         64th Regt.
  12th Foot,   ”         ”         65th Regt.
  19th Foot, 2d Batt., const^d     66th Regt.
  20th Foot,   ”         ”         67th Regt.
  23rd Foot,   ”         ”         68th Regt.
  24th Foot,   ”         ”         69th Regt.
  31st Foot,   ”         ”         70th Regt.

  The Second Battalion of the 32nd  was constituted the 71st Regt.
        ”        ”            33rd   ”        ”         72nd Regt.
        ”        ”            34th   ”        ”         73rd Regt.
        ”        ”            36th   ”        ”         74th Regt.
        ”        ”            37th   ”        ”         75th Regt.

After the peace of Fontainebleau, in 1763, reductions were made
in the regular army, and the number of regiments of infantry was
limited to SEVENTY. The above 71st, 72nd, 73rd, 74th, and 75th
Regiments were consequently disbanded in that year.

15. The number of regiments of infantry continued at _Seventy_,
until the commencement of the American War in 1775, and the
renewal of hostilities with France and Spain in 1779, when it
was increased to _One hundred and Five_ regiments, exclusive of
_Eleven_ unnumbered regiments, and thirty-six independent companies
of Invalids.

16. After the General Peace in 1782 the number of regiments of
infantry was again reduced.

17. In consequence of an increase of possessions in India, and of
additional troops being necessary for the suppression of certain
native powers, which were hostile to the British Government,
additional corps were raised and embarked for the East Indies in
1779, and in subsequent years.

18. The present _Seventy-first_ regiment was raised in December,
1777, and embarked for India in 1779. Its number was changed from
73rd to 71st regiment in 1786.

19. The present _Seventy-second_ regiment was raised in December,
1777, and embarked for India in 1781. Its number was changed from
78th to 72nd regiment in 1786.

20. The _Seventy-third_ regiment was raised as the second battalion
of the forty-second (Highland) regiment, in 1777, and embarked for
India in 1781. It was formed into a distinct regiment, and numbered
the 73rd (Highland) in 1786.

21. The 74th (Highland), 75th (Highland), 76th, and 77th regiments
were raised for service in India in October, 1787, and embarked for
India in 1788.

22. The 78th (Highland), 79th (Highland), 80th, 81st, 82nd, 83rd,
84th, 85th, 86th, 87th, 88th, 89th, 90th, and 91st (Highland)
regiments were raised in 1793, immediately after the commencement
of the war with France, occasioned by the revolutionary and violent
proceedings in that country in 1793.

23. The 92nd (Highland) and 93rd (Highland) regiments were raised
and placed on the establishment of the army, the former on the 3rd
May, 1796, and the latter on the 25th August, 1800.

24. The _Scots Brigade_ was numbered the _Ninety-fourth_ regiment
on the 25th December, 1802. This corps had been formed in the
year 1568, for service in Holland against the oppression of
Spain. Being a British corps, its services were demanded from the
United Provinces by King James II. on the rebellion of the Duke of
Monmouth in 1685, after the suppression of which it returned to
Holland. It again embarked for England with the Prince of Orange
at the Revolution in 1688. It remained in Great Britain until the
Protestant cause had been established, and it re-embarked for
Flanders in 1691, and served in the campaigns of King William III.
It remained in the service of Holland until 1793, when it was
decided by King George III., upon the application of the British
officers remaining in it, to require the corps to return to Great
Britain. It was taken on the British Establishment on the 5th July,
1793. It then consisted of _Three_ battalions; in 1795 it was
reduced to _Two_ battalions, and embarked for Gibraltar. In 1796 it
was formed into _One_ battalion, and proceeded to the Cape of Good
Hope. It embarked, in 1798, for the East Indies, from whence, after
much distinguished service, it returned to England in 1808. It,
embarked for Cadiz and Lisbon, and served with great credit in the
Peninsular War, from January, 1810, to July, 1814. It was disbanded
at Belfast on the 24th December, 1818.

25. The _Rifle Corps_, commanded by Colonel Coote Manningham,
was formed and added to the establishment of the Army on the
25th August, 1800. On 25th December, 1802, it was directed to be
numbered the _Ninety-fifth_ regiment, but was taken out of the list
of _numbered_ regiments of infantry on the 6th February, 1816, and
directed to be styled “_The Rifle Brigade_.” It then consisted of
three battalions, which were distributed at the following stations,
viz.:--

  1st Battalion.--6 Companies with the Army of Occupation in France,
                  and 4 Companies at Shorncliffe.

  2nd Battalion.--6 Companies with the Army of Occupation in France,
                  and 4 Companies at Shorncliffe.

  3rd Battalion.--10 Companies at Dover. This Battalion embarked for
                  Ireland in March, 1816. It was disbanded at Birr on
                  the 24th of November, 1818.

26. The present 94th, 95th, 96th, 97th, 98th, and 99th regiments
were added to the establishment of the Army in the early part
of the year 1824, in consequence of the increased number of the
colonial possessions of the British Empire.


FOOTNOTES:

[49] The Corps, which had been formed in 1737 by Colonel James
Oglethorpe for service in Georgia and South Carolina, was disbanded
in 1749. It had not been ranked in the number of regiments of
infantry in the Official Records of the Army, although in some
publications of that period it was numbered the _Forty-second_,
regiment, according to its seniority and the date of its formation.

[50] A _Fourth Division_ was formed at Woolwich by Order in Council
dated 15th August, 1805.

NOTE.--The Compiler of these Records feels it a duty to
acknowledge, that he has derived a principal portion of the means
of drawing up the details of the services of the Marines from “_An
Historical Review of the Royal Marine Corps_,” _published in 1803_,
“_by Captain Alexander Gillespie, who served as an Officer in that
Corps upwards of twenty-four years_;” a work of considerable merit
and research, which reflects great honor on its author, as an
excellent scholar and a most zealous officer.

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
