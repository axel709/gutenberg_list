                           MY DAUGHTER ETHEL


   IN RECOGNITION OF LOVING SERVICE AND OF SKILLED AND PATIENT
   LABOUR, DEVOTED TO PREPARING THIS MATERIAL FOR THE PRINTERS




                                PREFACE


In these volumes, I have undertaken to present a record of the Indexes
which have been issued under the authority of the Church of Rome, or
which, having been compiled by ecclesiastics, were published under the
authority of the State, between the year 1546 (the date of the first
list of prohibited books which may properly be described as an Index)
and 1900, in which year was issued the second Index of Leo XIII, the
latest in the papal series.

To this record I have added a selection of the more noteworthy
examples of censorship during the earlier centuries of the Church (a
list which begins with a curious prohibition in 150, probably the
earliest instance of censorship by a Church council); a schedule of
the more important of the decrees, edicts, pastoral briefs, etc.,
issued under ecclesiastical authority, which had to do with the matter
of censorship; and a specification of certain censorship regulations
which, before the publication of the first Index, came into force
in the several States of Europe. Such a schedule of decrees and
regulations can, of course, lay no claim to completeness. I have
attempted simply to present examples of prohibitions and condemnations,
from decade to decade, which were typical or characteristic, and from
which some impression could be gathered as to the nature and the extent
of the censorship experiments throughout the centuries in the several
communities concerned.

A brief account has been added of the organisation and of the
operations of the Roman Inquisition and of the Congregation of the
Index, as it was from these bodies that emanated the series of papal
Indexes, and with them rested, from the middle of the sixteenth
century, the responsibility for the shaping of the general policy of
the Church in regard to censorship. The plan of the treatise does
not render it practicable to attempt any general survey of political
censorship or the censorship of the State, but I have presented a brief
selection of examples of State action in censorship, in order to make
the necessary comparison between the methods followed by the State
and those of the Church, and to make clear that the censorship of the
Roman Church was (at least outside of Spain) not so autocratic in its
principles, nor so exacting and burdensome in its methods, as was the
censorship which was from time to time attempted by State governments
acting for the most part under Protestant influence.

I have attempted to base upon these schedules and records some
conclusions as to the actual influence of the general system of
censorship, as connected more particularly with the enforcement of
the penalties prescribed by the Indexes, upon the production and
distribution of literature in the several communities which recognised
to a greater or less extent the authority of the Church. An interesting
indication of the extent of this influence is given through the
records of the business of the printer-publishers and booksellers
of the period, in such States as Italy, Spain, France, Germany, the
Netherlands, and England.

Finally, I have attempted, in the closing chapters, to make a study of
the literary policy of the modern Church as indicated in the latest
of the papal Indexes and in certain utterances by representative
Catholics concerning the censorship policy of the Church, which have
come into print during the past quarter of a century.

In collecting the material for the several schedules of Indexes,
decrees, etc., I am chiefly indebted to the treatise of Heinrich
Reusch, _Der Index der Verbotenen Bücher_, published in Bonn
in 1885. Dr. Reusch’s work may be described as monumental in the
thoroughness and authoritativeness of its scholarship. The information
presented in regard to the series of Indexes and decrees is most
comprehensive and precise. The compass of Reusch’s three volumes (which
comprise twenty-four hundred closely printed octavo pages) renders
them, however, unavailable for the use of the general reader. I have
knowledge of no work in English which presents, with any measure of
completeness, the record of the Indexes, and of no book in any language
which attempts a general survey of the purpose and results of the
censorship of the Church. It has seemed to me, therefore, that I might
render some service to the study of the conditions affecting literary
production and distribution, by utilising certain portions of the
material collected by Reusch in a work prepared for English-speaking
readers, which should present the schedule of the Indexes and a summary
of the more noteworthy of the decrees, edicts, briefs, etc., having to
do with censorship, and by connecting with this a study of the results
secured through this censorship policy of the Church and of the range
of its influence.

I have been able to include in the catalogue of Indexes certain titles
which were not listed by Reusch, and I have added the record of the
Indexes which have been published since the date of Reusch’s treatise.
I have not been dependent upon Reusch’s schedules for the contents
of the Indexes themselves, as I have been able to make a personal
examination of all of the more important Indexes in the series from
examples in my own library, and in the comprehensive collection of
my valued friend Mr. Archer M. Huntington. Mr. Huntington has, I may
mention, rendered a most important service to students of the Index
through his reprints, produced in facsimile, of five of the earlier
issues as follows: Louvain, 1546; Louvain, 1550; Cordova, 1550;
Cordova, 1554; Valladolid, 1559.

Certain Indexes have been selected from the long series as on one
ground or another entitled to special attention. For these I have
given, in addition to some analysis of the prefatory matter, the
accompanying Bull and the regulations, and a specification of the
more important of the literature which is represented in the lists
of the books condemned. Among the Indexes that call for such fuller
description and analysis are the following: Louvain, 1546, (usually
classed as the first in the series of the Church Indexes); Rome, 1559,
(the first in the series of papal Indexes); Trent, 1564, (the papal
Index which secured the widest and most continued influence); Rome,
1607, (the only expurgatory Index in the papal series); Rome, 1664,
(in which is presented the condemnation of Galileo); Rome, 1758, (the
Index which marked the beginning of the wider literary policy for the
Church); Rome, 1900, (the latest of the papal Indexes and the one which
must, therefore, be taken as expressing the present literary policy of
Rome). I have also given, with some detail, analyses of certain of the
Spanish expurgatory Indexes, as these present a class of censorship
quite distinct in character and not attempted outside of Spain.

Separate chapters are devoted to the treatment throughout the series
of Indexes of certain subjects of continued importance, such as the
relations between the Church and State, the consideration given to
Erasmus and to Luther, the treatment of the monastic orders, etc.

In Chapter IX of the second volume, is presented a study of the
influence of the Index upon the book-trade in the several States of
Europe. While there are in existence no trustworthy statistics for such
a record, certain general results can be determined from the history
of the printer-publishers and from the transfer of the centres of book
production and distribution from the States which were under the direct
control of the Index regulations to territories in which the action of
censorship was less effective, or, as in Holland, non-existent.

The titles of the works utilised or cited as authorities from which
quotations have been made will be found in the bibliography. I have
thought it desirable, for the convenience of later students of the
subject, to include also in this bibliography the titles of certain
other important works having to do with the subject of censorship, from
which I did not have occasion or opportunity to make citations.

I desire to express special acknowledgment to Dr. Mendham, whose
_Literary Policy of the Church of Rome_ was published in London
in 1834. The author made a thorough study of such of the Roman and
Spanish Indexes as were within his reach, and he has been able to
throw no little light upon the methods adopted in Church censorship.
His vivacious treatise, which may be said fairly to bristle with
controversial opinions and conclusions, constitutes a curious
antithesis to the volumes of Reusch, who hardly permits himself to
connect with his comprehensive catalogues and records any opinions
whatsoever.

For matters connected with the Inquisition, the authorities are the
well-known _Histoire de l’Inquisition_ of Llorente, and the monumental
_History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages_ by Henry C. Lea. The
first volume of Lea’s _History of the Inquisition in Spain_ comes
into publication just as my own work is completed. For the history of
the operations of the Church in Spain, operations which were largely
conducted under the authority of the Spanish Inquisition, I have,
however, been able to utilise Lea’s _Religious History of Spain_, which
for this division of the subject-matter is the book most frequently
cited. (In the Spanish chapters, in order to avoid the repetition of
the full title, the reference has been made simply to “Lea,” and is to
be understood as connected with the above volume.)

For matters connected with the book-trade and with the influence on
the work of the publishers of the regulations of the Index, the chief
citations are from Kapp’s _Geschichte des Deutschen Buchhandels_ and
from Putnam’s _Books and their Makers in the Middle Ages_.

The leading authority for the modern Catholic view of the literary
policy of the Church is the treatise on the Index by the Jesuit Father
Hilgers, which was published in Freiburg as recently as 1905, and which
is certainly a most forcible and effective example of controversial
writing.

A little volume by the Paulist Father Searle entitled _Plain Facts
for Fair Minds_, published in New York in 1895, is valuable for its
statement of the present policy of the Church in regard to the relation
of faith with science and as to the rightful influence of the authority
of the Church upon intellectual action.

A treatise by Charles Dejob, a French Catholic, which came into
print in Paris in 1885, has been found interesting for its effective
presentation of the Gallican point of view, both of the present date
and of the earlier centuries, in regard to controversial matters.

I have occasion to render a cordial personal acknowledgment to
the well-known scholar the Rev. Thomas J. Shahan, of the Catholic
University of America, for most friendly service and valuable
suggestions. I owe thanks also for friendly counsel received from the
Rev. A. A. Lambert, of the Paulist Fathers.

With the expectation that these volumes will be used chiefly for
purposes of reference, it has seemed desirable to arrange the material
according to the cyclopaedia method, under certain main headings
with sub-headings for the special divisions of each subject. Such an
arrangement involves, of necessity, some repetition, but it is hoped
that the convenience of securing for the presentation of each subject
division a larger measure of completeness, may outweigh the annoyance,
from the literary point of view, of an occasional reiteration.

                              CENSORSHIP




                               CHAPTER I

                INTRODUCTORY: THE INDEX AND CENSORSHIP


In any investigation of the development of literary production and of
the relations of the producers of books with the reading public, it is
necessary to give consideration to the influence exerted upon literary
activities, and upon the actual effectiveness of literature, by the
censorship and the restrictive measures instituted by the Church.

Church censorship may be said to have begun as early as 150, with an
edict issued by the Council of Ephesus, in which the _Acta Pauli_
(an unauthenticated history of the life of St. Paul) was condemned and
prohibited. During the centuries following, a number of similar edicts
or mandates were published by councils, by individual ecclesiastics,
and by civil officials acting at the instance of the authorities of
the Church, under which edicts the faithful were cautioned against the
pernicious influence of various works classed as heretical, and the
heretics who had been concerned in the production and circulation of
such writings were threatened with penalties ranging from confiscation
of property to imprisonment, excommunication, and death. A schedule of
these decrees and edicts will be found in a later chapter.

The revolution in the methods of the production and distribution of
literature brought about by the invention of printing in the middle of
the 15th century, had, as an immediate result, an enormous increase
in the influence upon the shaping of popular opinion of the written,
or rather of the printed word, that is, of thought in the form of
literature. The work of the printers was at first welcomed by the
rulers of the Church. They convinced themselves that the Lord had
placed at their disposal a valuable instrument for the spread of
sound doctrine and for the enlightenment of believers, and with this
conviction, they found funds for the support of a number of the early
printers and kept their presses employed in the production of works of
approved theological instruction.

It was in fact not until nearly three fourths of a century after
Gutenberg, when the leaders of the Reformation were utilising the
printing-presses of Wittenberg for the spread of the Protestant
heresies, that the ecclesiastics became aroused to the perils that the
new art was bringing upon the true faith and upon the authority of
the Church. If the people were to be protected against the insidious
influence of the new heresies, it was absolutely essential that
some system should be instituted under which the productions of the
printing-press could be supervised and controlled. The more active and
far-reaching the operations of the printers, the greater the necessity
for the watchful supervision of their work, and the greater at the same
time the difficulty in making such supervision complete and effective.
The requirement was met by the institution of a system planned to
permit no books to reach the public that had not been passed upon and
approved by ecclesiastical examiners appointed for the purpose. To
this end, the production and the circulation of any literature not
so approved were stamped as constituting a misdemeanour of the most
serious character, one that might, under certain circumstances, become
the final sin against the light, the offence against the Holy Ghost.

The German historian Pütter says[1]:

   “As a result of the great facility brought about in the
   production of books by the invention of printing, there came
   to be anxiety on the part of the authorities lest teachings
   destructive of religion or morality, or inimical to the
   interests of the State, should be given to the public. On this
   ground, the conclusion was in all countries promptly arrived
   at that no production should be permitted to come into print
   that had not been passed upon and approved by an officially
   instituted censorship, and that no printing-offices should
   be established excepting under proper license and effective
   supervision.”

In 1559, the responsibility for the censorship of literature was first
assumed directly by the papal authority through the publication of
the _Index Auctorum et Librorum Prohibitorum_, of Paul IV, the
first of a long series of papal Indexes, aggregating, up to 1899,
forty-two in all. It does not appear to have been the intention either
of Pope Paul IV or of his successors that the responsibility for the
system of censorship should be retained under the exclusive direction
of the papal authorities, and I find no record of objections having
been raised to the publication of the Indexes prepared by such
representatives of the Church as the theological faculties of the
Universities of Louvain and of Paris, or by the Inquisition of Spain.
There were, however, very material differences between the lists as
shaped in Rome of works condemned as heretical and the similar lists
issued within the same period in Louvain, Paris, or Valladolid; books
of undoubted heresy included in one Index would fail to find place in
another, and it is difficult to arrive at any consistently followed
principle or policy by which the selections of the different compilers
were determined.

In the absence of any definite instruction to the contrary, it
might at first be assumed from the wording of the prohibitions that
any and all of the Indexes, published under the direction of such
ecclesiastical authorities as those specified, must have been intended
to be equally binding on all the faithful, irrespective of political or
ecclesiastical boundaries. We know, however, as a matter of history,
that, in the majority of cases, no attempt was made to enforce the
prohibitions of the Index outside of the territory of the State in
which it had been promulgated.

It is difficult to secure any trustworthy information as to the
precise range of the effectiveness of these prohibitions, but it seems
probable that the Roman Indexes were held to be in force outside of the
immediate territory of the Church only after they had been formally
accepted and promulgated by the authorities, ecclesiastical and
political, of the individual States, such as Spain, France, the Empire,
etc.

The Index of 1559 was, as stated, the first of the series of papal
Indexes; but as early as 1542, the Inquisition of Rome had promulgated
a special edict prescribing penalties for the reading of heretical or
of doubtful books, and in 1545 was published the first Italian list of
prohibited books and authors. In 1571, under Pope Pius V, the task of
compiling the papal Indexes was confided to a body organised under the
name of the Congregation of the Index, which is still (1906) carrying
on its work.

The work of the framers of these Roman Indexes exercised an important
influence even in the States in which the papal prohibitions had not
been officially published, as the titles collected for them were
largely utilised by the makers of the Indexes of Spain, France, and
Belgium; and in like manner, the material put into print in Louvain,
Paris, and Valladolid formed the basis of certain of the Roman lists.

A more authoritative position in regard to the work of censorship was
taken by the Papacy through the publication, in 1564, of the Tridentine
Index. This Index, as well through its formulation of the rules for
censorship, as because of the greater comprehensiveness of its lists,
constituted the most authoritative guide that had yet been issued.
The Tridentine Index was promulgated, under the authority of pope and
of council, throughout all the Catholic States and also in countries
in which the Catholic Church, while no longer the ruling power, still
possessed followers. It was printed in a long series of editions
issued from all the more important publishing centres of Europe; its
lists formed the basis of all subsequent Indexes, while its rules were
accepted as the guide for future censors and compilers. After the
Council of Trent, a wider and more assured recognition was given by
churchmen throughout the Catholic world (from which must, curiously
enough, be excepted Catholic Spain) to the authority of the Papacy,
acting through the Congregation of the Index, to retain the general
direction and control of the business of censorship.

In 1758, two centuries after the publication of the Tridentine
Index, was issued the Index of Benedict XIV, the lists in which
represented better bibliographical work than had previously been
attempted, and which was particularly important as representing what
may be called the last attempt of the Papacy to maintain any general
censorship of the world’s literature. The series of papal Indexes from
time to time has been continued, the latest bearing date 1899; but the
compilers of these later Indexes content themselves with repeating
the general rules or principles by which the reading of the faithful
should be guided, while the lists of current publications are limited
almost exclusively to works by Catholic writers, and chiefly to works
of a doctrinal character, the teachings of which are found to be in
one respect or another open to condemnation. The proportion of books
absolutely prohibited becomes smaller, the greater number of the
works cited being placed in the lists of _libros expurgandos_,
the reading of which is forbidden only until certain corrections or
eliminations have been made, _donec corrigatur_. The Index of 1884
and that of 1899 bring forward from the more important of the preceding
papal Indexes the titles of the most noteworthy of the works condemned
in these. No attempt, however, is made to condemn (except under general
rules and principles) the increasing lists of modern Protestant
doctrinal books, or to characterise or differentiate the great mass of
the world’s literature. The printing-press had outgrown the machinery
of ecclesiastical censorship.

During the centuries in which the censorship of the Church was active
and comprehensive, it must have exerted a very material influence
over the relations of authors with their public; the effectiveness of
literature as an intellectual force in directing or shaping public
opinion was assuredly not a little hampered and restricted, while the
value of literary productions as property was seriously lessened and,
in certain territories, entirely destroyed. It is evident that if
the production, the sale, and the possession of copies of a book are
prohibited, the work can possess no property value within the territory
throughout which such prohibition can be enforced. Its possibilities
as property are either cancelled altogether, in case the prohibition
can be made effective throughout the entire possible market, or are
lessened in the proportion in which such market has been curtailed.
In fact, in the cases in which, under the more extreme penalties of
a censorship system, the purchase or the possession of a copy of
a condemned work involved fine, imprisonment, or excommunication,
the work might be said to possess a negative in place of a positive
commercial value. The author, and others interested with the author,
in securing a circulation for the book, might even be imagined as
offering, if not a bonus, something in the nature of a guaranty against
risks, to those who would co-operate with them in the dangerous task of
distributing copies.

The other obstacles that have been noted as standing in the way of the
development of literary property had been negative in their character.
The lack of realisation on the part of the literary worker himself
that he was producing anything entitled to be classed as property;
the difficulty on the part of the reading public in arriving at the
conception that there could be property in anything not material,
in such an abstract entity as a right; the physical impossibility,
in advance of the invention of printing, of the multiplication of
copies of a literary production by any method that should preserve
for the author any control over the text of each copy, or any share
in the selling price of the same; the limitations of the territory
within which, after the era of printed books had begun, and after the
development of public opinion had brought a community to the point of
recognising the property rights of one of its own literary workers,
such recognition could be made effective; the fragmentary character and
necessary inadequacy of the system of local privileges; and finally the
lack, during a long series of years after the invention of printing, of
any adequate publishing machinery for making known to possible buyers
the existence of books, for distributing the copies, and for collecting
the amounts paid by the purchasers;--all these obstacles operated
against the possibility of securing for producers of literature such
protection under the law and such recognition for the results of their
labours as had, in all organised communities, been for centuries
assured for other classes of producers.

Against such obstacles and difficulties, the recognition of literary
productions as property and the actual commercial value of the labour
of literary workers had, through the first century of printing been
making an assured, though fitful and interrupted, progress. Early in
the 16th century, however, the rulers of the State and the authorities
of the Church began to find occasion for alarm at the increasing range
of influence of the printed word, and came to the conclusion that if
the community was not to be undermined by heretical, dangerous, and
demoralising opinions, measures must be taken to maintain supervision
and control over the production of books.

The interference on the part of the political rulers was fitful and
intermittent, and appears at no time to have arrived at the dignity
of a continued policy or system. In a number of States, while the
rulers continued to claim for themselves the exclusive control of
the printing-press (as was, for instance, the case with Spain,
France, and the Holy Roman Empire), they were willing to confide to
the ecclesiastics the selection of the books to be condemned and
prohibited. The actual work of censorship, at least in the countries
which remained Catholic, fell, therefore, more and more into the hands
of the Church, and was, as a result, carried on with reference to
the clerical standard of orthodoxy and morality, and to the clerical
theories of what was required for the welfare of the community.

In the series of the Indexes, the proportion of works of a purely
political character was small as compared with the long lists of books
which had been condemned on doctrinal grounds. It is in order, however,
to bear in mind, as a limitation of this statement, that during the
two centuries in which censorship was the most active and exerted the
largest influence upon intellectual development, say from 1550 to 1750,
the minds of men were directed more largely to doctrinal questions
than to political matters. It was not the State but the Church whose
authority and existence had been assailed and the contest was fought
out over creeds and not political platforms.

When, with the outbreak of the Reformation movement, it became apparent
how great a range of influence was possessed by the printed sheet, the
problem which confronted the authorities of the Church was certainly
serious in more ways than one. For the space of fifteen centuries, the
education of the people had remained almost exclusively under the
direction of the Church. The faithful believers (and the unbelievers
were but few) had accepted their entire intellectual sustenance at
the hands of the priests. The instruction given in the parish schools
instituted by the Church was almost entirely oral, although some use
was made of written alphabet tables and of written psalters with the
musical notations.

The instruction for those who took up higher branches of study,
students who were for the greater part destined for the Church, was
naturally, during the manuscript period, carried on by the priests, not
only because but few others possessed anything that could be called
scholarship, but also because it was only in the collections of the
monasteries (the _armaria_) that the requisite manuscripts could
be found. It is true that with the beginning of the 13th century, the
educational work of the earlier universities, such as Bologna, Paris,
and Oxford, begins to assume importance; but even in the universities,
outside of the faculties of law and of medicine, the direction of the
instruction was retained very largely in the hands of the Church, the
lecturers in the department of philosophy, for instance, being almost
exclusively ecclesiastics.

During the 13th century, there does come into existence a body of
scholarship which is outside of the Church, but it remains the case
that, up to the time of Luther, the great mass of the people had looked
to Rome, and to teachers acting under the authority of Rome, for its
light and leading, intellectual as well as religious. The association
of education and intellectual training with the Church is in fact
fairly indicated by the use of the term “cleric.”

In 1516, the leaders of the Reformation, in beginning their long
contest against the abuses of the Church of Rome, a contest which
soon developed into a fight for the complete overthrow of the
papal supremacy, promptly availed themselves of the power of the
printing-press. While the words spoken in the pulpit or in the
market-place could reach at best but a few hundred of hearers the
tracts poured forth from the Wittenberg presses, the “flying-leaves”
(_Flüg-schriften_), carried the teachings of Luther and Melanchthon
to many thousands, and it was through the influence of these “winged
words” (_epea pteroenta_) that the revolt developed into a revolution.

To the devout adherents of the Church of Rome, and particularly to
those to whom had been given the responsibility for its government
and for the spiritual guidance of its members, the situation, not
only during these earlier years of fierce strife against Protestant
heresies, but throughout the succeeding centuries, presented the
gravest difficulties. There is something almost pathetic in the long
series of attempts made by popes, councils, bishops, congregations, and
inquisitors to protect the souls of the faithful against the baneful
influence of the ever-increasing tide of literature that was pouring
forth from the various publishing centres, and so much of which was
calculated to lead men astray from the true doctrines and to bring them
into risk of everlasting perdition. To ecclesiastical rulers, honestly
holding such a conviction, there was, of course, but one duty. They
must use every means in their power to suppress the heresies, and to
warn and protect their flocks. What were the fortunes or even the lives
of a few evil-minded or devil-inspired printers and writers as compared
with the eternal hopes of the great masses of men? Nay! It was better
that the misguided reader himself should, by prompt and, if necessary,
extreme penalties, lose all that he had in this world, rather than that
he should be permitted, in continuing to absorb heresy and in spreading
its leprosy abroad, not only to sacrifice his own soul, but also to
undermine the faith of his fellow-men.

The action of the Church was, therefore, not only logical and
reasonable; it was the only course that was possible for an
organisation to which, as its rulers undoubtedly believed, the
Almighty had confided the care of the spiritual welfare of mankind.
The safety of the soul depended upon the nature of the intellectual
sustenance taken in, whether through the ears or through the eyes. All
literature or instruction in any form, spoken, written, or printed,
must, therefore, before reaching the understanding, be sifted under
the authority of an all-wise and infallible Church. The believer must
be protected against harm, the doubter must be recalled to the true
path, and the heresies and the heretics must alike be exterminated.
While it was only after the active propaganda work of the Reformers
of Wittenberg had made clear the perils of the printing-press that
any general system of censorship was attempted, there had been, as
pointed out, instances of prohibited books centuries before the time of
Gutenberg. An heretical utterance in manuscript form was a restricted
or manageable evil, in that its influence was limited to the small
circle of clerics and could not, at least directly, reach the masses.
It was, however, none the less an evil which it was the duty of the
Church to condemn and to repress.

The record of the Index is also to be considered as an important
contribution to the history of literature. Thomas James, whose treatise
on the _Index Generalis Librorum Prohibitorum_ was printed
at Oxford in 1627, says in his preface that his book is addressed
particularly to the curators of the Bodleian Library to whom it should
serve as a guide concerning the works which it was particularly
desirable to collect and to preserve; only the curators must be sure to
secure the earlier and, therefore, unexpurgated editions. Bishop Barlow
writes that he has found the

   “_Indices Expurgatorii_ invaluable as records of the literature
   of the doctrines and opinions obnoxious to Rome.... Their
   _Indices Expurgatorii_ are very good common-place books and
   repertories (for that use we make of them) by help of which we
   may presently find what any author by them censured has uttered
   against the vulnerable parts of the Catholic system. In these
   _Indices_ we are directed to the book, chapter, and line where
   anything is spoken against any superstition or error of Rome; so
   that he who has the _Indices_ cannot want testimonies against
   Rome.”[2]

Reusch points out that the Indexes have preserved the record and
the purport of not a few works of interest and importance, the very
existence of which would otherwise have been lost sight of. It is also
the case that the Index lists have preserved the titles of a number of
works of comparatively trivial importance, which, if they had not been
fortunate enough to secure the condemnation of the Church, would have
fallen still-born from the press.

It was the practice, in making condemnation of books either through
a general Index or under a separate decree, to order destroyed
such copies of the condemned books as could be collected, and this
destruction was, as a rule, done by fire. In the record of censorship,
there are, however, a number of instances of books which had received
the honour of a special condemnation for burning, the titles of which
had not appeared in any Index issued by the Church or in any separate
papal or diocesan decree. The books so recorded were, with hardly
an exception, condemned under civil authority. The writers who have
brought together records of books condemned to be burned (of whom
Peignot is perhaps the most important) give, under the same general
heading, titles of books selected from the Index, books condemned
under special decrees of the Church, and works which had fallen under
the censorship of the civil authorities. As will be noticed in the
later chapters, the special emphasis given to the importance of a book
through the burning of copies in a public place, constituted a valuable
advertisement and usually extended its influence.

The history of the Index may be divided into two main periods. The
first begins, as far as the papal censorship is concerned, in 1559,
with the publication of the _Index Auctorum et Librorum_, prepared
under the instructions of Paul IV, and closes with the end of the
16th century, with the issue of the final appendices to the Index of
the Council of Trent. During this period, the chief and almost the
only subject-matters considered are the great questions raised by the
Reformation. In the second period, which closes with the Index of
Benedict XIV, issued in 1758, the controversies turn, as indicated by
the character of the works placed on the lists, on issues of doctrine,
opinion, and conduct arising within the Church itself. The writers
whose works are condemned during this period are for the most part
ecclesiastics of the Church.

The work done during the 19th century by the Congregation of the Index
may be said to belong to a third or modern period, in which, as
will be noted later, the censorship over literature and the literary
instruction for the faithful has for the most part taken the form
of statements of general principles in place of detailed lists of
pernicious books. The attempt to characterise the mass of the world’s
literature has been abandoned and the comparatively few titles named
are (with a few curious exceptions) those of doctrinal works emanating
from within the Church itself and the errors in which are, therefore,
likely to mislead believers.

It is to be borne in mind further in connection with the general
division of periods suggested by Reusch, that while the greater portion
of the work of the Index was carried on under the direct supervision of
the popes, a long series of Indexes were issued by authorities acting
independently of the Papacy, such as the Inquisition of Spain, the
theological faculty of the University of Paris, the theological faculty
of the University of Louvain, and other bodies.

The first Index, in point of date, of the long series, was in fact
issued not in Rome but in Paris, the second and third in Louvain,
the fourth in Valladolid, etc. The several dates will be given in
the schedules presented later. It is also noteworthy that, while the
papal Indexes were of course in form binding on the entire Church and
throughout all the States classed as Catholic, they were not actually
put into force in the several States unless or until they had been
accepted and confirmed by the respective rulers; and, as a fact, a
number of the papal Indexes were never so accepted either in France
or in Spain. The Church of Spain, acting through the Inquisition,
undertook to carry on an independent system of literary censorship and
of literary repression. The inquisitors condemned a number of works
which do not appear in the Roman lists, and declined to condemn not
a few books which had in Rome been classed as pernicious. A similar
course was taken by the Gallican Church, whose censorship was carried
on by commissions of ecclesiastics acting under the direct authority of
the Crown.

A necessary result of the condemnation of books by a number of
authorities was a large measure of confusion in regard to the status
of a number of books and of not a few authors. A faithful believer,
who was fully prepared to accept in regard to literature the guidance
of the authorities, may well have had cause for perplexity in finding
condemned and prohibited by one pope the works of an author whose
writings had received the special commendation of another, or in
being prohibited in Madrid from reading books which were permitted or
even recommended in Rome. In not a few instances, Indexes which had
been issued in regular course with the papal sanction were themselves
prohibited from being printed or promulgated in Spain, in France, in
Germany, or even in places as near to the papal seat as Venice.

During the period before the Council of Trent, the work of the
compilers of the Roman Indexes was chiefly based upon the Indexes
which had originated in Spain or in the Netherlands, while there is,
as said, occasionally ground for perplexity at the absence from the
Roman lists of works of undoubted heresy which had been duly condemned
by the censors of Valladolid or Louvain. It is not easy to understand
why the Papacy, having recognised the necessity for the exercise of
control over literary production, and over the operations of the
printing-press, should have permitted the system of Indexes to be
initiated anywhere but in Rome, and should have further permitted,
apparently without reprimand or protest, so large a proportion of the
long series of Indexes to be compiled and published by ecclesiastics
who, while claiming to be defending the true faith and to be carrying
out the policy of the Church, were not acting under the direct
supervision or authority of Rome. Independent action in such an
all-important matter as the direction of public opinion as expressed
through printed literature might have been considered a dangerous
precedent and undoubtedly did constitute an important factor in
strengthening the separate authority of the State churches of Spain and
of France.

Joseph Mendham finds in the Indexes the literary policy and the
doctrinal policy of the Church of Rome. He writes:

   “The Indexes issued by the Church of Rome may be regarded
   as a grand Index of the sentiment, spirit, and policy of an
   ecclesiastical empire, claiming with the most critical exactness
   the terrific appellation of the Mystery of Iniquity.

   “To no power but modern Rome is equally applicable the encomium
   of the poet on the ancient:

    _Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento;
    Hae tibi erunt artes; passisque imponere morem:
    Parcere subjectis et debellare superbos._

                                      Aen. VI, 852.

   “The other class of Indexes, the expurgatory, contains a
   particular examination of the works specified and indicates
   the passages condemned to be expunged or altered. For these
   Expurgatory Indexes, publicity was so little desired that it
   was the chief thing guarded against.... The copies were intended
   for the possession and inspection only of those to whom they
   were necessary for the execution of their provisions.... It was
   not thought desirable that the dishonest dealings of the writers
   of these censures should be known either to the authors who were
   injured and who would thus have an opportunity of justifying
   themselves, or to readers whose judgment must in many instances
   be at variance with that of the censors.”[3]

The framers of the several expurgatory Indexes found themselves
occasionally under the necessity of censuring and correcting the works
of writers accepted as the Fathers of the Church. Mendham gives an
example, from the Roman Index of Brasichelli, of a condemnation of
certain propositions printed by Robert Estienne, which propositions
are, he says, direct citations from the Fathers. Mornay, in his edition
of the Spanish Index of 1601, presents a list of similar condemnations
or expurgations of the texts of the writings of the Fathers themselves.
The propositions which, naturally enough, came under this condemnation
are those which appear to present grounds for the doctrine of
justification by faith and those which enforce the importance of the
injunction against the worship of images. The Jesuit Gretser, in
apologising for the action of the Church in the case of Bertram’s book,
makes the following interesting argument:

   “Although Bertram be prohibited, I deny that a Father is
   prohibited, for that one can properly be called a Father of
   the Church who feeds and nourishes to the faithful salutary
   doctrine, who being placed over the family of the Lord, gives it
   in due season its portion of the corn. If, therefore, instead
   of the food of salutary doctrine and the portion of corn, he
   offered and distributed cockles and tares and the burrs and
   briars of perverse doctrines, so far from being a Father he is
   but a stepfather, not a doctor but a seductor.”[4]

In another page, Gretser writes: “Who, therefore, is so stupid as not
to recognise that the Church or the sovereign pontiff, while he reviews
the lucubrations of his sons, and wherein he corrects these, performs a
service grateful to the authors and a work useful to posterity.”[5]

It is a natural inference from the assumption by the Church of the
responsibility of indicating in the Index lists the books which are
on one ground or another pernicious and which require important
corrections, that the further responsibility is assumed of approving
by implication the books not thus condemned or not corrected through
expurgation. While it is the case that the Church has never admitted
this responsibility, the contention is one which has often been raised
and which does not appear to have been answered. If the books that
are not condemned by the Index are considered as having been approved
or even sanctioned by the Church, it would follow that the authority
in the Church from which the Indexes emanate could be understood to
approve and to sanction those doctrines or assertions from the writers
within the fold of the Church which these condemning decrees have
failed to proscribe or to expurgate. Such a contention does not appear,
however, to be really well founded when we bear in mind the necessary
limitations, even in the earlier years of the work of the Index, of the
facilities possessed by the examiners in passing upon publications
originating in various countries and not always even printed in the
common ecclesiastical language. The criticism presents, however, one of
the most serious difficulties attending the assumption by the Church
of this responsibility for the control of literary productions, even
though this control be limited to the writings of members of the Church
itself.

The Indexes were certainly utilised, and were intended to be utilised,
as instruments for the suppression of heresy and for the maintenance
of true doctrine as interpreted by the rulers of the Church. The
chaplain of Philip II of Spain (Alphonso de Castro) has declared that
in his opinion the purification of Spain from heretics was due to the
fact that in Spain and in Spain alone the prohibition of heretical
literature was effectively enforced. The continued prevalence of
heresies in other countries, even in such Catholic States as France,
Italy, and South Germany, was, in the opinion of Castro, due to the
lack of effectiveness in enforcing the purification of literature.[6]
It is the inference of Mendham that the effect referred to by Castro
was due not to the simple prohibitions of the Index but to the
enforcing of these prohibitions under the thorough-going methods of
the Inquisition. Cardinal Pallavicino has assigned the preservation
of Italy from the infection of presumed heresy to the activity of the
Inquisition and particularly to the work done both by the Inquisition
and the Index of the Congregation in suppressing heretical literature.
He speaks as if there had been serious risk, in the absence of
persistent efforts of this kind, that Italy itself might embrace the
Reformation.[7]

Mendham, who writes always as a bitter controversialist, is of opinion
that the expurgatory Indexes, and the expurgatory work done quietly
without the use of Indexes, were utilised so as to modify in the later
editions the text of the writings of the Fathers and of the earlier
authorities of the Church, in the respects in which this text did not
appear to give consistent support to the accepted doctrine of the
later Church, or in which words were used by the authors which could
be interpreted and which had been interpreted in support of heresies.
It is not practicable, without a careful textual comparison of the
“orthodox” and approved editions of the Fathers with the editions of
earlier date and with those which the Church censors found occasion to
condemn, to say how far there may be any foundation for this severe
arraignment. Mendham goes on to suggest that it had been the hope of
the Church gradually to replace the former and original editions of
books of this class with the editions approved by the Church.

   “In this way, the mouth of antiquity should be thoroughly shut
   up and prevented from uttering any syllable or sound against
   the doctrines of the later Church.... By the addition of words
   where opportunity and pretence might serve, and by drawing the
   marginal notes and glosses of their friars into the texts of
   the Fathers (as has already been handsomely begun with certain
   texts) the mouth of antiquity should also be opened for them
   (the present leaders of the Church). There remained then only
   the rectifying of St. Paul and of the other scriptural writers
   whose authority being already set beneath that of the Church,
   it were not such great matter to submit it also to her gentle
   and moderate censures; especially for so good an intent as the
   weeding out of heresies and the preserving of the faith Catholic
   in her purity and glory.”[8]

Panzer makes reference[9] to an Index printed in Louvain as early as
1510. The title is recorded as follows:

_Die Cathlogen of inventargen van den Quaden verboden bouken: na
advis der Universiteyt van Louen. Met een edict of Mandement der
Keyserlicken Majesteyt. Te Louen geprint bej Sewaes van Sassen.
MCCCCCX. 4^o._

No copy of an Index of this date was known (1897) in the British
Museum, and it is not referred to by Reusch. Knapp, in his scheme for a
History of the Index, is in accord with Reusch in making that of Paris
of 1544 the earliest. It seems probable that Panzer has been misled as
to the date of the Flemish Index.

The series of Indexes is understood, therefore, to begin with the
middle of the 16th century (that is, a century after the invention
of printing), but from the earliest years of the organised Church,
attempts had been made from time to time to protect the faithful
against the pernicious influence of heretical writings, by the
destruction of the copies and by the punishment of the writers when
these were within reach of the strong arm of the Church and when they
refused to be convinced of their errors.

A number of the editions of the Roman Indexes, as for instance that of
1819, bear as their motto: “Many of them also which used curious arts
brought their books together, and burned them before all men” (Acts
xix, 19); while on others was printed a head-piece engraved on copper,
representing the believers burning their books of magic. The example,
however, of these early converts, under the influence of the eloquence
of Paul, bringing of their own free will, to be destroyed, books the
teachings of which were believed to be incompatible with the doctrines
of Christianity, does not constitute a fairly logical precedent for the
later practice of the Church in punishing by excommunication and in
other ways those who continued to read books condemned as heretical.

Throughout the Middle Ages, there are a number of examples of
prohibitions, emanating from various authorities, and applying
sometimes to single books or individual authors, and sometimes to
groups. It is not likely that during the manuscript period, the
duplication or reading of the books denounced was seriously affected,
except in the immediate locality in which the prohibition was issued.
These earlier attempts at censorship possess interest chiefly as
indications of the ecclesiastical policy and of the varying standards
of different periods and of different places, and also because the
titles of the works selected for condemnation were in part utilised by
the compilers of the Indexes.

A “Directory” of heresy was prepared early in the 16th century
by Nicholas Eymeric of Cologne, under the title of _Directorium
Inquisitorium_. This was reprinted in Venice in 1607, _cum commentariis
Francisci Pegnae_. This Directory was, says Reusch, utilised by Bernard
Lutzenburg as the basis for his _Catalogus Haereticorum_,--Catalogue
of Heretics,--first issued in 1522. In these two lists have been
preserved the names of a number of persons classed as heretics, of
whose books there is no record, and who may possibly even never have
written anything, or at least never have brought anything into print.
The Lutzenburg Catalogue was utilised in the compilation of the Index
of Paul IV.

After the middle of the 13th century, the papal condemnations of
specific books frequently included the specification of names of the
examiner or examiners, usually one or more of the cardinals. We have
here the beginnings of the body that became later the Congregation of
the Index.

In 1256, in a Bull issued by Alexander IV against a tractate of William
of Saint-Amour, of Paris, the Pope says that his action is based upon
the report of four cardinals, to whom had been confided the task of
examining the work. All copies are ordered to be burnt within eight
days, under penalty of excommunication. Saint-Amour’s essay presents a
very unfavourable picture of the condition of the Church of the times,
and is especially sharp in its strictures upon the newly instituted
mendicant orders. After the beginning of the series of official
Indexes, the list of works concerning which the judgment of the
Church was reversed under the authority of the different popes, or of
successive councils, becomes considerable, and may easily have proved a
perplexity to faithful believers who were prepared to accept as a final
guide the infallible authority of the Church.

Before the close of the 12th century, there appear to have been no
attempts on the part of the Church to restrict the reading of the
Scriptures, or the distribution of the manuscript copies of the
Scriptural books. During the 13th century, several of the synods held
in France issued prohibitions of the use or circulation of versions in
the vernacular of the Scriptural books, with the exception only of the
Psalms. A similar prohibition was enacted for popular versions of any
doctrinal or theological writings. The Church was gradually developing
the procedure, finally formulated as a general policy, under which
laymen were to be forbidden reading either the Scriptures or works of
doctrine except under the immediate direction of the ecclesiastical
authorities.

Between the years 1239 and 1320, a series of orders were issued by
successive popes, beginning with Gregory IX, for the destruction of
copies of the _Talmud_.[10] In the first portion of the 16th century,
a more tolerant view was taken by the papal authorities in regard to
the preservation of the literature and the learning of the Hebrews; but
Julius III and his immediate successors again ordered the destruction
of the _Talmud_. The work is also included in the first of the official
Indexes, that of Paul IV. In the Tridentine Index, the previous
prohibitions are relaxed, but under Clement VIII the _Talmud_ was once
more condemned.

The whole business of the supervision of literature and the control of
opinion was of necessity very materially modified by the invention of
printing. It was at first assumed that the control of literature by
the Church would be strengthened by the new method of book production.
The ecclesiastical authorities decided that no books should be printed
excepting under their own supervision, and if there had been any
effective means of carrying out such a decision, the printing-press
would speedily have become a mere means of expression of Church
doctrine and Church policy.

The multiplying of the printing-presses and the development of
machinery for the distribution of the copies of the printed books,
together with the rapid increase in the public demand for such books,
speedily, however, rendered impracticable the effort on the part of
the Church to retain the control of book production.

The Louvain Index of 1546 was, as will be noticed in the later summary
of the Indexes, followed by several Spanish Indexes which were for the
most part compiled and issued under the direction of the Inquisition,
and during the succeeding centuries, the general control of the
censorship throughout the dominions of Spain remained in the hands
of the Inquisition. There was, in such an arrangement, one manifest
advantage; the authority that determined the offence was the same as
that which put into force the penalties that had been prescribed. As a
result of this identity between the power that judged and condemned,
and the power that carried the condemnation into effect, the censorship
was effective throughout Spanish dominions to an extent which was never
reached under any censorship machinery that was put into force in other
States. A book that was condemned in Spain did actually pass out of
existence, as far, at least, as Spanish territory was concerned, and a
similar fate occasionally befell the author. The copies that had been
printed were destroyed, and the printing or circulation of further
copies was too perilous an undertaking to be ventured upon.

If the Inquisition had been in a position to carry on throughout
Europe, or even throughout the Catholic States, a censorship as
effective as that put into force in Spain, the extermination of books
would have been so considerable that there would have been brought
about a serious break between the literatures of the centuries.

In France, the censorship was exercised in a more fitful and less
consistent manner. The Indexes originating in France were for the most
part compiled, under the authority of the Crown, by the theologians of
the Sorbonne. Books were, however, from time to time condemned under
the direct supervision of the royal chancellor.

It is to be borne in mind also that a refusal on the part of the
chancellor to issue a royal privilege for a book served to prevent its
publication, at least in France (the edition must as a rule have been
printed before the examination of copies by the royal censors could be
made), and was, therefore, practically identical with a prohibition.
The title of such an unprivileged and therefore unpublished work would
as a rule not find its way into the lists of the French Index. The
extent of the repression or restriction of literary activity can,
therefore, not be fully measured by the number of titles on the lists
of works prohibited.

It was unquestionably the case that the censorship had a very material
influence in discouraging the production of literature, an influence
that might be classed as an indirect damage to the intellectual
development of the community. While the fact of such interference
in a country like Spain in which the provisions of the censorship
were, under the Inquisition, enforced with strictness and often with
severity, is fully established, there can of course be no data for
ascertaining the extent of the loss.

It is easy to understand that if an instructor in one of the Spanish
universities got into trouble with the Inquisition in bringing into
print a series of lectures, he would, in the majority of cases, have
kept his later studies or conclusions in the safer form of manuscript.
It is probable also that his associates on the faculty, or the students
who had followed his work, would in great part be deterred from
pressing their studies to a logical conclusion. Not only would the
books not be printed or even completed, but the lectures themselves,
on subjects that had once been stamped by the Church as pernicious,
would be stopped. The Inquisition was in a position to put an end to
any courses of study or lines of investigation that it found reason to
disapprove, and the record shows that it did not neglect the exercise
of its authority to such end.

In like manner, if the business of a printer-publisher had been broken
up or seriously hampered through penalties imposed for the crime of
circulating literature found deserving of condemnation, it is very
certain that such dealer, if continuing in business at all, would have
reason to avoid taking in the future any such undesirable risks, and
his competitors in the book-trade would wish to be equally conservative
in the selection or acceptance of books for their own presses.

Apart even from the cases of books which had been condemned as
heretical, and which had involved in their condemnation the authors,
the printers, and the booksellers, the whole system of censorship
constituted with its delays, its interference, and its fees or charges,
a very heavy burden upon the business of printing and selling books.
The details of the methods employed by the censors will be referred to
in a later chapter. Their operations, were, of course, not confined
to the supervision of books printed in Spain or prepared for the
Spanish press. An elaborate system of inspection was instituted for
books ordered by booksellers or by individuals from other countries.
Large numbers of these foreign publications were destroyed in the
customs-houses, while in other cases, as a milder judgment, the
supplies were refused admission and had to be returned to the shippers.
As a result, the business of importing books could hardly be made
profitable, and at times became dangerous. It is not surprising that,
in the face of such difficulties and under the hampering influence
of such burdens, the book-trade of Spain, during the three centuries
following the date of the first Spanish Index, was attenuated and
insignificant, and as compared with that of France, Germany, or the Low
Countries, played but an inconsiderable part in the community. It is in
fact difficult to understand how under these exceptional conditions,
any printer-publishers or booksellers should have been able to maintain
an existence.

In Italy, also, the publishers and booksellers worked during these
centuries under similar difficulties, but there were mitigating
circumstances. The Inquisition was able to retain in its hands only
a partial control of the censorship, while outside of the papal
States its authority was not infrequently set at naught. In fact, in
Venice, for a large portion of this period (to use a phrase of a later
century), the writs of the Inquisition “did not run,” an exemption
which was by no means the least of the several factors combining to
make Venice a centre of book-production. The division of the Peninsula
into a number of states or principalities was an important influence in
maintaining for the printer-publishers some measure of independence,
as the undertakings that were stopped or interfered with in one State
could, with no insuperable difficulties, be carried across the nearest
boundary and brought to completion in another. A further influence
serving to secure protection for the printing-press, and to promote
its activity, was the personal interest on the part of many of the
Italian princes in intellectual pursuits and in literary production,
an interest that caused them to compete with each other for the
possession of scholars and to offer special advantages to enterprising
printer-publishers, and which made them frequently willing, for the
sake of the literary prestige of their States, to brave the disfavour
of the ecclesiastical authorities. In Italy, therefore, while the
production and distribution of books was frequently interfered with
by the operations of the Congregation or by the Inquisition, it is
probable that (at least outside of the papal States) the actual
detriment caused by the censorship to intellectual interests was by no
means as great as, from the long list of mandates, prohibitions, and
penalties, might at first be inferred.

In France, the conditions which opposed and those which favoured the
freedom of the press differed in several respects from those which
obtained in Spain or in Italy. We have here to deal with a central
government whose authority over a fairly homogeneous territory was
for the greater part of the periods under consideration not seriously
questioned. The literary and publishing interests of the kingdom
were centred in the capital, and in fact, with the single exception
of Lyons, there were, outside of Paris, no publishing centres of
importance. The literary policy of the Church, expressed through the
theological faculty of the Sorbonne, could, therefore, conveniently
be brought to bear very directly upon the operations of the Paris
book-trade, the organised guild of which itself formed part of the
university. Finally, the authority of the Crown, acting through
the royal courts or directly through the chancellor, was, in form
at least, available for putting into effect any measures for the
supervision or restriction of literature with which the administration
might find itself, in accord. Notwithstanding, however, this
apparent completeness of the supervising machinery, the book-trade
of Paris was able to retain a very large measure of independence,
and its contributions to the literary productions of Europe were,
notwithstanding the censorship, of continued importance. Several
influences worked in its favour. The divines of the Sorbonne and the
leaders of the Gallic Church, while often actively opposed to scholarly
undertakings, were by no means prepared simply to register and to
execute the censorship decrees of the authorities of Rome. No Roman
Indexes were accepted as binding upon believers in France unless or
until they had been formally approved by the French Church and had been
put into effect by the authorities of the State. With an occasional
exception, such as that of the Index of the Council of Trent, the
Gallican censors preferred to frame their own Indexes and to adapt
these to the requirements and conditions of their own country.

The State was still less ready than the Church to accept as
authoritative instructions emanating from Rome in regard to the
character of the books that should be produced or should be permitted
in France. Successive kings took the ground that the final authority
in regard to censorship was vested in the State, that is to say in the
Crown. The divines of the Sorbonne were instructed or permitted to
pass upon the applications for privileges for books belonging to the
department of theology, but even for these, their dicta were not always
accepted and (as in the case of the Bibles of Estienne) were sometimes
entirely set aside by the Crown.

And finally, the University of Paris, for centuries the most
important in Europe, contended through a long series of years that
the supervision and control of the book-trade of the kingdom was
a university matter, and it succeeded for a series of years, with
occasional exceptions and set-backs, in maintaining this contention
very largely until, with the gradual extension of the powers of the
Crown, the direction of censorship and of privileges had been, with
nearly all other divisions of government, brought directly under royal
authority.

More than one scholar has been quoted as saying that the intellectual
life and development of Europe during the centuries between 1556 and
1800 could be traced by the lists of condemned books, and that these
books would in themselves constitute a fairly complete library for the
thoughtful student. There might be ground for con|plaint that, owing to
the remissness or ignorance of the censors, the lists included titles
of a number of works not valuable enough to deserve condemnation, and
omitted many of real value and continued importance. Irrespective of
such inconsiderable exceptions in one direction or another, there can,
I judge, be no question that a very large proportion, one may say by
far the largest proportion, of the world’s literature that stood for
intellectual activity and insight, literature which expressed the
conclusions of the greatest minds of their several generations, and
which stood for the development and the civilisation of the community
itself, had been placed by the Church in the Index of condemned and
prohibited books. Comparatively few of these books of light and
leading had been omitted (and those apparently through inadvertence)
and comparatively few books had been included which, apart from any
questions of heresy or pernicious doctrine, would, under a standard
not theological, be classed as dangerous or unwholesome for the
community. In fact, the service of the Index in suppressing or in
discouraging books _contra bonos mores_ may be characterised as
unimportant.

I have referred to the service to literature and to the intellectual
development of mankind (a service none the less important because it
was so entirely unintended) brought about through the action of the
Church in preparing Indexes that served to chronicle the books of the
thinkers and thus to preserve and extend their teachings. It is natural
to enquire to what extent this service was offset by the interference
with literary production and distribution caused by the burdens of
censorship and by the repressive measures of the inquisitors and other
censors. To such an enquiry there can be no very satisfactory answer.
The materials or data for any precise calculation do not exist. In the
chapter on the Index and the Book-trade, I have however presented such
general data as I have been able to secure concerning the effect of the
censorship regulations upon the operations in different States of the
printer-publishers and the booksellers.

It is evident that the extent of the influence of the system is not
to be measured by the number of books condemned after publication
or after being put into type. It is probable that the restrictions
and detriments placed in the way of literary production constituted
a more important influence on the intellectual life and development
of the people than the cancellation or expurgation of books that had
already come into existence. These latter might be reprinted, and to
a considerable extent were reprinted, in other countries, in which
case their authors would be able to feel that their work had not been
altogether without results. But the influence of the writers who were
deterred from writing, and of the lecturers who were afraid to continue
to speak, was lost not only for their own community but for their own
development, unless, as from time to time happened, they preferred
banishment to repression and silence. Whether the leaders of thought
were expatriated or were silenced, the effect in the home country on
the university centres and on the so-called educated circles was the
same.

At the very time when in Italy, France, Germany, and the Low Countries
the intellectual activities were greater than ever before known, and
minds working in new directions of research were expressing themselves
in varied and suggestive literary productions, scholarship in Spain
had been confined in a few fixed channels, its expression had become
stilted and reiterative, and the literature of thought, imagination,
and opinion had almost disappeared. It would be interesting to
ascertain whether an intelligent Romanist of to-day, who believed
conscientiously in the necessity, or at least in the wisdom, of
ecclesiastical censorship, would be prepared to accept as satisfactory
the results of such a system in the one country in which it had been
carried on with any measure of consistency and thoroughness.

It must at the same time be borne in mind that this censorship was not
imposed upon Spain by an authority from without. The power of Rome
was never applied, either in regard to literature or to other matters
controlled by the Church, with greater strenuousness or severity in
Spain than in France or in Italy itself. In fact, whether from choice
or from necessity, the direction of the affairs of the Church of Spain,
and the regulation of the discipline of its members, were left by the
Papacy to be controlled by the Spanish ecclesiastics themselves. The
Inquisition, as organised in Spain, was the creation of Spaniards and,
with hardly an exception, the inquisitors who during the centuries in
question carried on its work were Spanish in birth and in training.
The policy of placing in the hands of the Inquisition the creation
and the administration of a system of censorship of literature, and
the responsibility for the preparation of the Indexes, is one for
which the rulers of the kingdom, acting naturally under the influence
of their spiritual advisers, must be held directly responsible. The
ecclesiastics succeeded in convincing not one but successive Kings
of Spain that for the safety and welfare of the community literature
and education, higher as well as elementary, must be placed under the
supervision of the Church.

A further responsibility, however, for this abandonment to
ecclesiastical control of the intellectual life of the community
must rest with the people themselves. If the literary productions
of Spain were restricted and hampered to the point of crushing out
altogether, if the men of active minds were banished or made dumb, if
the business of the printer-publishers was brought to a close, and if
the few enterprising readers who, notwithstanding the instructions
of their confessors, might still venture to interest themselves in
current literature, were obliged to depend for their supplies upon the
chance of securing copies of the prohibited books smuggled in with
bales of merchandise, it was because the people of Spain had decided
for themselves that such methods were necessary for their spiritual
safety. It may well be a matter of surprise that, under the conditions
of censorship obtaining during the 16th and 17th centuries, it should
have been possible to bring into existence any such national literature
as that which is described by Ticknor and other historians. With a
censorship which, in form at least, differed very little in the several
great Catholic States of Europe, the fact that the Spaniards were
willing to accept and to give obedience to a series of regulations, of
penalties, and of prohibitions such as it proved to be impossible to
enforce in Italy, in France, or in Germany, is evidence of some special
quality in the Spanish nature.

In Italy, the fulminations of the Church in regard to heretical or
dangerous literature were, in form at least, as severe in their
penalties and as sweeping in their prohibitions as those which emanated
from the inquisitors in Spain. There appears, however, to have been
no period during which there was any consistent consecutive system
applied throughout the entire Italian peninsula in carrying out the
regulations that had been formulated by the Inquisition of Rome
or by the Congregation of the Index. The successive papal Indexes
were produced at considerable and very varying intervals. There is
no evidence in the series of these Indexes of any definite policy
in regard to the terms of years to be covered or the extent or the
classes of the literature which was to be considered. From time to
time, as successive popes assumed the papal chair, there would come
one possessing a larger measure of literary interests or a clearer
perception of the influence of literature upon the religious conditions
of the community. Instructions would then be given for the production
of a new papal Index, the lists in which would include, in addition to
the more important of the titles in the preceding Indexes, the works of
the later period the use of which was to be forbidden.

As will be made clear in the detailed record of the papal Indexes,
the attempt was made but once in Rome to produce an _Index
Expurgatorius_. The popes and the members of the Congregation,
who had the immediate responsibility for the work, appear to have
shrunk from a task with which the Spanish inquisitors had charged
themselves without hesitancy, namely the reshaping of books which had
already come into circulation and influence, in such manner as to
eliminate heretical passages or expressions which might in any way
conflict with sound doctrine. The fact that through such eliminations
and interpolations the purpose and character of the work might be
materially altered and the author might be made responsible for
utterances or opinions which were not his own, or the further fact
that through any such reshaping the literary form, and sometimes even
the actual sense of the narrative, was practically sacrificed, did not
trouble the minds of the revisers selected by the Spanish inquisitors.

The effectiveness of the prohibitions and regulations instituted
in Rome by the Congregation of the Index varied materially in the
different Italian States. The printer-publishers of Rome were naturally
obliged to give respect to the papal ordinances concerning literature,
but even in Rome itself it was usually not difficult to secure through
the booksellers, in Venetian, Florentine, or foreign editions, copies
of prohibited books. It was in Venice that, as far at least as the
territory of Italy was concerned, the smallest measure of attention was
paid to the prohibitions of the Roman Index. The contest instituted,
about 1580, by Paolo Sarpi against the authority of Rome to control
the printing-presses of Venice, was not the beginning but really the
culmination of a long series of active protests on the part not only of
the printers, but of the government of the republic itself. In fact,
the conflict in which Sarpi took place as leader was brought about
immediately by a renewal of attempts on the part of the Curia to secure
for Rome the control of censorship in Venice.

In the Catholic States of South Germany, the record of the censorship
of Rome is very similar to that which has been noted in the case of the
Italian States. There were times in which very strenuous censorship
regulations were issued, under the authority of either emperor or
prince, in such cities as Vienna, Basel, Nuremberg, Frankfurt, etc. The
immediate result of such ordinances was to check the operations and to
curtail the undertakings of the local printers, but the effect on the
final circulation of the books condemned was but inconsiderable.

In France, the prohibitions of the papal Indexes and the censorship
regulations instituted by the Roman Congregation of the Index were not
accepted as binding unless and until they had been confirmed by the
rulers of the Gallic Church, and there were but few instances in which
the French bishops attempted to take action in regard to censorship
excepting under instructions emanating from the Crown. There was, under
the successive kings, not a little variety of policy in connection with
censorship, and of method in carrying out the policy adopted. With
certain monarchs the influence of the ecclesiastics was much stronger
than with others, and during such reigns, the decisions concerning the
acceptance of the Roman Indexes and the work of preparing the Indexes
originating in France were left in the hands of the bishops. From reign
to reign, however, the precedent became more firmly established that
the final authority in the matter rested with the Crown, and that even
when the immediate direction of censorship was left with the bishops,
their power to act came to them not from the pope, but from the king.

Any jealousy that may have existed with the ecclesiastics against
interference on the part of the State with functions elsewhere held as
belonging to the control of the Church, appears in France to have been
more than offset by the determination of the Gallic Church to maintain
its full independence against Rome. Censorship in France remained,
therefore, a matter kept under the direct control of the Crown, to
an extent which was paralleled in no country excepting England. The
Kings of France, during the two centuries succeeding the invention of
printing, were for the most part more keenly interested in furthering
the operations of the printer-publishers, than in protecting the
doctrines of the Church and the faith of believers against the risks of
heretical literature. The undertakings of the printers had been made
part of the work of the royal university, and the literary achievements
of the Paris press brought prestige to the rulers of France.

Censorship was, of course, exercised, and in the case of theological
works, the supervision of which was confided to the divines of the
Sorbonne, the prohibitions and restrictions were not infrequently
narrow and burdensome. It was the case, however, that the press of
Paris was on the whole less seriously interfered with during the
censorship period than that of any other Catholic State. It was further
true, also, that while the prohibition of a book by the Sorbonne did
from time to time block the sale of the Paris edition, bringing serious
loss to the original publisher, it could not prevent the distribution
of copies even among French readers. A work that had proved of
sufficient importance to be placed on a Paris Index was pretty sure to
be promptly printed in Lyons or in Tours, and if or when the authority
of the censors had succeeded in stopping the operations of the
provincial printers, the presses of Geneva, Cologne, and Amsterdam were
always ready to supply the demand that was quite certain to continue
for a work classed as heretical or dangerous. The total circulation
and final influence of the book was, therefore, likely to be furthered
rather than restricted by the action of the censors.

In the Low Countries, and particularly in Holland, the operations of
the censors and Index-makers of Italy, Spain, and France constituted a
factor of not a little importance in furthering the development of the
book-trade. The printer-publishers of Holland kept themselves promptly
informed of the operations of the various authorities which had taken
upon themselves the task of supervising the literature of the world.
Early copies of all the original Indexes found their way, as soon as
produced, to Leyden, Amsterdam, and Utrecht, and were promptly utilised
by the enterprising Dutch publishers as guides for their publishing
undertakings. Within a few months of the time when the censors of Rome
or of Paris had completed, as they supposed, the cancellation of the
local editions of the condemned books, copies of the Holland issues
would begin to find their way, more or less surreptitiously, into
the hands of the readers of the country of origin. Literature is, in
this respect, like water; whatever the intervening obstacles, it is
pretty sure to find its level, or, like air, to find its way under the
pressure of the mass of the intellectual atmosphere to the points
where there exists an intellectual vacuum or need.

It is certain that at a time when, in the absence of journals,
there were but limited means of information as to the existence or
the character of literary productions, the Indexes proved to be
most serviceable guides concerning books for which communities were
waiting. The restrictions and prohibitions of the censorship system
brought serious and sometimes crushing difficulties upon publishing
undertakings in certain centres, but proved of invaluable service as
suggestions for active-minded readers throughout Europe, and also for
the undertakings of publishers in countries like Holland, who, free
from restrictions at home, were very ready to utilise their presses
for the profitable work of distributing abroad literature for which
the Church, in advertising it as heretical, had taken pains to prepare
the way and to provide a public. However great were the difficulties
brought through the Church censorship upon the book-trade in other
communities, it was certainly the case that for the printer-publishers
and book-distributors of Holland it secured very direct and
considerable advantages.

In England, even prior to the schism under Henry VIII, the Church of
Rome never secured any control over the censorship of the press. The
responsibility for the production of books had, with special reference
to the convenience of supervision, been concentrated at an early date
in the Stationers’ Company. The supervision of the operations of
this company was retained under the direct control of the Crown and
was carried out by officials appointed under royal authority. These
supervisors or censors were for the most part not ecclesiastics. Such
censorship as took place in England was in fact more largely political
than ecclesiastical. The perils guarded against had to do with assaults
upon the authority of the Crown rather than with opinions classed as
heretical by the Church.

It was also the case that while the book-trade of the realm had, very
conveniently for the censors, been centred in London and organised
under the Company of Stationers, there were from time to time presses
in activity outside of the capital, presses the work of which very
largely escaped supervision. Either through such county town issues
or by means of supplies imported from Holland, it is probable that
English readers who were prepared to interest themselves in heretical
literature met with no serious or continued difficulties in the way of
securing the desired material. For England as for Holland and North
Germany, the Indexes published at Rome and elsewhere served also as
convenient guides for the book-buying and the reading of the more
active-minded members of the community.

As before stated, it is not easy to arrive at any trustworthy net
result concerning the final effect upon the literary conditions of
Europe of the work of the ecclesiastical censors. The preceding brief
summary gives my impression as to the more immediate effect of the
censorship in the more important States which were within reach of
the supervision of the Church. It would appear as if the literary
conditions of each community had been hampered or interfered with in
almost direct proportion to the efficiency of the censorship machinery.
To the extent to which the prohibitions and restrictions of the Indexes
were carried out consistently, literary activity was checked, the
production of higher literature was lessened, and the intellectual
capacities of the people were stunted.

It seems hardly possible that the indirect service, to which
reference has been made, that was rendered by the work of the censors
in emphasising for communities not within the control of their
prohibitions the distinctive interest and abiding importance of the
prohibited books, could make an adequate offset for the sterilising
influence exerted within the communities that were under thorough
supervision and control.

The system of organised Church censorship had its origin during the
time of the Reformation in the necessity under which the Church felt
itself of protecting the faithful, and perhaps more particularly
the doubtful, from the influence of heretical arguments presented
in printed form. The earlier history of the Indexes is therefore
closely associated with the record of the conflict of the centuries
between Protestantism and the Church. This relation has, however, a
confusing effect in the attempt to estimate the direct influence of
the censorship upon literature, for the reason that the direction of
literary activities and the character of literary production were,
during the two centuries succeeding the first protests of Luther,
very materially affected, outside entirely of the influence of the
censorship, by the theological and controversial tendencies of
the time. The Reformation was an intellectual revolution, and the
contest was carried out on both sides with intellectual weapons.
These controversies had the effect of sharpening men’s minds and of
cultivating the capacity for thought, for analysis, and for reasoning
power. In reading the controversial literature which proceeded on the
one hand from such Protestant centres as Wittenberg and Geneva, and
on the other from Rome, Cologne, or Louvain, it may well be to-day a
matter of surprise that the writers were able to count upon circles of
readers likely to be interested in their dissertations and capable of
understanding the class of arguments presented. It was the case during
the 16th and 17th centuries not only that long series of controversial
works were prepared by scholars for the reading of scholars, but
that great masses of material, mainly in the form of pamphlets, were
placed upon the market for the instruction or the influencing of what
we should to-day call the common people. The tracts, “flyleaves”
(_flügschriften_), which were distributed from the presses of
Wittenberg were addressed directly to artisans, farmers, and peasants.
For a few years, the controversial literature of this class was
monopolised by the Protestants. The arguments of the defenders of the
Church were addressed to the scholars and preachers with the idea of
reaching through them the understanding of the common people. Before
the middle of the 16th century, however, Catholic writers also began to
give attention to the production of controversial literature addressed
directly to the common people. The historian who to-day examines the
files of this Reformation literature is struck by the high estimate
placed by the writers on both sides upon the understanding of these
readers among the people. It would be difficult to find to-day among
the peasants of Germany, or in the same classes of other countries,
any body of readers who would be prepared to interest themselves in
thoughtful literature of such a standard, or who would be competent to
follow the reasoning and the arguments of these controversialists of
the Reformation period. It may be borne in mind, as a credit to the
educational influence of the Roman Church, that these communities, the
common people of which were sufficiently intelligent to be influenced
to the point of revolution by the arguments of the Protestant leaders,
must have owed their education almost entirely to the priests of the
Church of Rome.

While, in this direction of controversy, the Reformation had a
stimulating effect on the intellectual interests of a number of the
European States, it may be admitted that in certain respects its
influence upon literature was hampering and restricting rather than
elevating. In the countries in which the Protestant opinions secured
control there was, for a considerable period at least, a decided
setback to the study of the classics and to all literary production
outside of the domain of theology or religion. The interest in
classical literature which had been initiated in Italy under the
so-called Renaissance and in connection with the rediscovery of the
great works of Greece, was for the time lost sight of in the Protestant
States of Germany and of the Netherlands and among the Calvinists of
France and of England. Classic writers were classed as “pagans” and
their works were discouraged as likely to have a worldly influence on
the minds of the faithful. The work in the universities in these States
was, outside of the theological faculties, more and more restricted
to what might be called utilitarian channels. The textbooks planned
by Melancthon and his associates were of distinctive service for
elementary education and undoubtedly represented a material advance
over the books of the same grade which had been utilised for the
elementary Catholic school. For a considerable period, however, the
educational advance stopped with this elementary work; and in the
universities there was a lack of higher grade teaching and a narrowing
of the whole course of training.

The letters of Erasmus emphasise the conviction that took shape
in his mind as to the essential injury brought upon the cause of
higher scholarship by the absorption of so large a proportion of the
active-minded thinkers in matters purely controversial. He believed
strongly in the necessity for radical reforms in the Church. He
recognised as clearly as did the Protestant leaders the enormity of the
evils which had been permitted to creep into the administration of the
affairs of the Church and to corrupt both the teachers and the hearers.
He looked with dismay, however, upon the operations of the reformers
when these took the shape of antagonism to the final authority of pope
or council and thus constituted an assault upon the very existence of
the Church Universal.

To Erasmus and to other scholarly readers in the Church whose devotion
to the religious purposes of the Church organisation was possibly
purer minded and more consistent than his own, men like Sir Thomas
More, and Dean Colet, it seemed essential for the wise management of
the Church upon which depended the maintenance of the true faith, that
the leadership and authority should be left in the hands of scholars.
They dreaded lest the establishment of the doctrine of individual
interpretation, of the right of believers to a direct relation with
their Creator, and the shaping of creeds and of rules of action apart
from the counsel and guidance of trained ecclesiastics, must of
necessity lead to such excesses as were evidenced in the performances
of the Anabaptists in Westphalia, or in the utterances of the fanatics
who incited the peasant revolt in Saxony.

It may be concluded, therefore, that while the machinery of
ecclesiastical censorship remained in force only in the countries
which the Reformation had not succeeded in detaching from the control
of the Church, there was no such immediate advantage, at least during
the half-century succeeding the work of Luther, in the production and
distribution of literature in the Protestant countries as might have
been expected to result from the freedom secured from the interference
of the ecclesiastics. By the close of the 16th century, however,
when the Protestant control of the States which have since remained
Protestant seemed to be fairly assured (an assurance which was, to be
sure, rudely interrupted twenty years later, by the opening of the
“Thirty Years War”), there came a reaction in the educational centres
in these States in favour of the work of higher education. The study of
Greek, and to a smaller extent that of Hebrew, was taken up in certain
of the Protestant colleges. A wide circulation was secured for the
text of the Greek Testament, which had been issued by Erasmus through
the presses of Froben in Basel, and in connection more particularly
with this Testament the study of Greek was carried on with increasing
interest in Wittenberg, Erfurt, and other of the educational centres
of North Germany. The introduction, for the purpose of Greek study, of
the editions of the great Greek classics, prepared by Aldus and one or
two other of the more enterprising printers, naturally brought with it
a renewed interest in the works of the Latin writers. These were no
longer classed as pagan frivolities but were accepted as belonging to
the intellectual property of the world.

This revival of letters, untrammelled by Church censorship, was,
of necessity, seriously interfered with during the ravages of the
“Thirty Years War.” A considerable period elapsed after the Peace of
Westphalia, in 1648, before the disasters and destructions of this long
contest were sufficiently made good to enable the natural interests
and activities of the people to resume their course. By the beginning,
however, of the 18th century, the larger intellectual activities of
the Protestant States of Europe had made themselves clearly apparent.
The literary production of these States not only greatly exceeded in
mass that of the Catholic States, but included a very much larger
proportion of what might be called the world’s books, that is to
say, of books which exerted a continued and increasing influence
from generation to generation. The great works of imagination, the
records of noteworthy scientific discoveries, the histories accepted
as authoritative, the treatises in higher metaphysics, were produced,
of course not exclusively, but in very much greater proportion, in the
countries which had either thrown off altogether the authority of Rome,
or which, as was the case with France, while still classed as faithful
to the Church, had practically refused to accept the supervision of
the Roman Church over their national literature. It may be concluded
that the theory upon which the censorship of the Church was based is
incompatible with the natural and complete development of the literary
potentialities of a people and interferes with the production of higher
literature in direct proportion to the effectiveness with which it may
be applied.

It may further be concluded that, excepting in the case of Spain,
the ecclesiastical censors did not succeed in hampering very
largely the literary production even in Catholic States, although,
as before pointed out, the general influence of the Church appears
always to have worked against the full intellectual development of
the communities that remained in the faith and that accepted the
ecclesiastical authority.

The wider enquiry as to the extent of the influence of the Church
censorship, during the three centuries of its greatest activity, upon
the literary production of Europe, that is to say, the question as to
how far, in case no censorship had been attempted, this literature
would have been different in character from or greater in importance
than, that which actually came into existence, must, I judge, remain
unanswered.

The responsibility for the policy pursued during the centuries since
the advent of printing for a censorship control of literature does not
rest alone with the Catholic Church. In all of the Protestant States,
attempts were made from time to time to control and to restrict the
operations of the printing-press. In the Protestant States of Germany,
the preparation of the local Indexes or lists of books condemned,
and the issue of the decrees for the separate condemnation of any
individual work, were in part placed in the hands of the Protestant
ecclesiastics and in part managed directly by the civil authorities.
The authority, however, under which the orders were issued and the
penalties were enforced was always that of the State. The edicts
were given out in Dresden, or in Berlin, as in Brussels, Madrid, or
in Paris, in the name of the ruler. The series of such decrees or
censorship actions is long and complex.

There can, of course, be no question that from the outset the leaders
of the Protestant Reformation believed as thoroughly in the necessity
and in the rightfulness of the censorship of literature as did the
ecclesiastics of Rome or of Spain. The duty of protecting the minds
of the faithful against the insidious and wrong doctrine was just as
clear to Calvin, to Zwingli, and to Luther, as it was to Loyola or
to Brasichelli. The Protestant ecclesiastics were, however, not in a
position to enforce or even to threaten any such penalties as could
be imposed by the authorities of Rome, and as in fact were imposed
most consistently and effectively by the Inquisition in Spain. They
had under their control no such dread penalty as excommunication. The
leaders of the Protestant faith were compelled to rely upon the civil
authorities of their several States for carrying out the provisions of
such censorship policy as might be decided upon, and concerning the
wisdom of which they had been able to convince the civil rulers.

Irrespective of the censorship initiated by the divines, which had for
its purpose the maintaining of a specific creed and the preservation
from attack of “sound theology,” there is record of a long series of
attempts (attempts which have in fact continued into the 20th century)
to enforce what may be called political censorship,--that is to say,
the control of literary production in the interests of the State and in
support of the authority of the State, against opinions believed to be
inimical to such authority. It may at once be admitted that the series
of Protestant prohibitions, whether ecclesiastical or political in
their origin, do not compare favourably with the similar prohibitions
issued under the authority of the Church of Rome. There is far less
consistency of purpose, and, at least as far as the political edicts
are concerned, there are more examples of bitter and brutal oppression
than can be matched anywhere in the States controlled by the Roman
Church outside of Spain.

The list of books which came into condemnation under such Protestant
censorship during the centuries in question was very much more
considerable than the aggregate of all the lists of the Indexes
issued in Rome or issued under the authority of the Roman Church.
The censorship policy of the Protestants was more spasmodic, and may
be admitted to have been directed on the whole by a less wholesome,
dignified, and honourable purpose. It represented very much more
largely the spirit of faction or of personal grievance, while the
political censorship was, of necessity, influenced by the action of the
party which happened for the moment to be in control or of the minister
who had for the time the ear of the ruler.

While in form this Protestant censorship may, therefore, be considered
as less defensible than that of the Church of Rome, it may be contended
that in fact it has proved on the whole much less serious in its effect
upon intellectual activities. In nearly all of the Protestant States,
the attempts on the part of the divines to exclude religious and
theological literature which was not in accord with their own dogmas
and opinion, were given up in the century succeeding the Reformation.
The censorship action of the State has, as we know, continued in
certain divisions of literature to the present day, but even under
this political censorship, it cannot be contended that literature
has been seriously repressed or even largely influenced. It is not
practicable, under the conditions obtaining in modern States and with
the active intercourse between the residents of such States, to repress
any literary productions for which a circle of readers is waiting. The
books condemned and prohibited in Berlin come into print in Leipsic,
or if the Imperial authority is sufficient to control conditions in
Leipsic, are produced without difficulty in Amsterdam or Leyden. It is
impossible to prevent the books so printed from finding their way back
even into the territory in which their production and distribution has
been absolutely forbidden.

Father Hilgers, whose work on the history of the Index of the Roman
Church constitutes the latest, and probably the best, authority on the
orthodox Catholic view of the purpose and the influence of the Roman
censorship, is able to make a very formidable indictment against the
operations of Protestant censorship, ecclesiastical and political.
Certain of the statistics collected by him are presented in the chapter
on Protestant censorship. He does not undertake to explain, however,
why it is that the literary activities repressed from the time of the
Reformation in the Catholic States have continued to develop and to be
strengthened in all the States which were outside of the control of
Roman censorship. He makes no reference to the very specific example
presented in his own German country of the transfer of literary
leadership and of publishing activities from the States of the South to
the States of the North, a transfer which went on in direct connection
with the success of the Church in controlling the printing-presses in
the territory of such States as remained Catholic.

The concentrated attention given during the period of the Reformation
and by the generations immediately succeeding the Reformation to
controversial issues had an important influence on the intellectual
development of the people. The effects produced upon general education,
and particularly upon primary education, were also important. The
students who had secured from the higher grade schools, established
by the reformers throughout North Germany, a common school education
such as prior to Melanchthon’s time had not been attainable anywhere in
Europe, were, in great part at least, not satisfied to let the work of
education be brought to a close with the end of their school course.
They pressed into the universities which had remained in existence
after the withdrawal of the Catholic instructors. New universities
were speedily required in many of the North German States to meet the
growing demand for higher instruction. The organisation of a number
of the important universities of North Germany dates from the century
succeeding the Reformation. These universities speedily became the
centres of literary activity and of publishing production. With the
relaxation of Catholic censorship, the publishers were free to prepare
for the public reprints of such old-time literature as was now being
called for. The study of Hebrew, discouraged and almost brought to
a close in the Catholic universities after the long persecution of
Reuchlin and his followers, was taken up with earnestness by Protestant
scholars who had so largely based their creed and their conduct on
the teaching of the Old Testament. The study of Greek, discouraged at
least for a time in Catholic France, after the banishment from Paris
of Robert Estienne with his printing-presses, was pressed with fresh
energy in Leipsic, in Leyden, and in Oxford.

It is not easy in this 20th century fully to realise the state of
mind of the individuals, whether ecclesiastics or civilians, whether
of Rome, of Paris, or of London, who have not hesitated to assume
for themselves the wisdom requisite to pass upon all divisions of
knowledge and who have been willing to take the responsibility for the
direction, the restriction, and the continued control of intellectual
activity in all realms of thought. I may recall the eloquent argument
in behalf of the freedom of the press which was made three centuries
back by one great thinker, who was at the time (as it is fair to
remember) protesting against the oppressive action not of the Church of
Rome, but of the Parliament of Protestant England. John Milton writes
in the _Areopagitica_:

   “For Bookes are not absolutely dead things, but doe contain a
   potencie of life in them to be as active as that Soule was whose
   progeny they are; nay, they do preserve as in a violl the purest
   efficacie and extraction of that living intellect that bread
   them. I know they are as lively and as vigorously productive
   as those fabulous Dragons’ teeth; and, being sown up and down,
   may chance to spring up armed men. And yet on the other hand,
   unlesse warinesse be used, as good almost kill a Man as kill a
   good Booke; who destroyes a good Booke, kills Reason itselfe;
   Kills the image of God as it were in the eye. Many a Man lives a
   burden to the Earth; but a good Booke is the pretious life-blood
   of a master spirit, imbalm’d and treasured but on purpose to a
   Life beyond Life. ’Tis true, no age can restore a Life, whereof
   perhaps there is no great losse; and revolutions of ages doe not
   often recover the losse of a rejected Truth, for want of which
   whole Nations fare the worse. We should be wary therefore what
   persecution we raise against the living labours of publick men,
   how we spill that seasoned life of Man preserved and stored
   up in Bookes; since we see a kinde of homicide may be thus
   committed, sometimes even a martyrdom; and if to extend to the
   whole impression, a kinde of massacre, whereof the execution
   ends not in the slaying of an elementalle Life, but strikes at
   that etherialle and first essence, the breath of Reason itselfe
   and slaies an Immortality rather than a Life.”[11]




                              CHAPTER II

                CENSORSHIP IN THE EARLY CHURCH, 150–768


“Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together
and burned them before all men.”[12] This reference to the action taken
by certain men in Ephesus under the influence of the eloquence of St.
Paul is frequently cited by upholders of the censorship policy of the
Church of Rome. Some of the more artistically printed editions of
the Index (such for instance as the first Roman edition of the Index
of 1758) contain, as a vignette title, a representation of Paul’s
converts casting into the flames their books of magic, and beneath
the print the verse from the Acts. The fact that St. Paul was willing
to have his disciples, in their zeal for their new-born faith, make a
voluntary sacrifice of writings believed to be incompatible with this
faith cannot, of course, in itself constitute a sufficient warrant
for the claim developed later by the Church of the right to destroy
all literature that its rulers considered to be pernicious, or for
the still larger claim of authority to inflict extreme penalties on
those who produced, multiplied, or possessed the works thus condemned.
An admonition to get rid of unchristian books is one thing, and the
imposition of excommunication (or of an unconscious liability to
excommunication), on the ground of the reading of erroneous doctrine,
is another and a very different thing. But the whole theory of Church
authority and of excommunication was, of course, a matter of slow
development through the ages that followed the preaching of St.
Paul. It was in fact not until the 16th century that there came into
existence anything that could be called a censorship policy or any
attempt at a general censorship system; but from the earliest periods
in the history of the Church there are instances of condemnations of
individual writers, and of prohibitions, under severe penalties, of the
manifolding or distribution of particular works. These prohibitions
are usually the result of one of the series of fierce controversies
about dogma that characterised the earlier centuries of the Church.
They emanate for the most part from councils, but they are occasionally
issued directly by the pope or by local bishops. In certain cases, they
take the form of an imperial edict, but even in these the initiative
comes from a council. It is probable that the influence either of
the councils or of the emperor in restricting the multiplication or
distribution of the writings that had been condemned was not very
effective. The edicts and decrees may be considered as representing an
expression of opinion (connected with one of the bitter theological
controversies of the day) rather than as regulations to be enforced.
There was in fact no machinery for the enforcement. The work of the
copying scribes could not be supervised, as was possible later for
the operations of the printers, and the manuscripts could be passed
from hand to hand among the sectarians, without the intervention of a
bookshop. There are instances of literary censorship on the part of the
imperial authorities of Rome before the institution of the Christian
Church. These are outside of the range of my present subject, but
certain examples may be cited as curiosities.


=Early Prohibitions of Literature.=--Tacitus remarks that Augustus
was the first ruler who undertook to punish a word written or spoken
(that is to say, a word unaccompanied by action). While the law of the
Roman Republic had recognised as deserving of punishment only criminal
deeds, the Emperor brought the authority of the law to bear upon
writings described as libellous or scandalous (_libelli famosi_).
He ordered, for instance, that the writings of Labienus should be
publicly burned. His successor, Tiberius, issued a still stronger
regulation for the supervision of undisciplined or insubordinate
writings. Cremutius Cordus was driven from his occupation and left
to die through poverty for the offence of speaking of Gaius Cassius
as “the last Roman.” His writings were ordered to be burned by the
Aediles. Tacitus speaks with scorn of those who, in the possession
of a little momentary power, undertake to crush out opinions not in
accord with their own, or to prevent such opinions from being handed
down to posterity. The writings of Vejinto were prohibited by Nero.
Concerning this prohibition, Tacitus writes: “So long as the possession
of these writings was attended with danger, they were eagerly sought
and read; when there was no longer any difficulty in securing them,
they fell into oblivion.” An edict ascribed to Domitian ordered that
the historian Hermogenes and any book-dealers who concerned themselves
with the distribution of certain writings of his which had libelled
the Emperor should be crucified.[13] The German historian Schmitz
is, however, of opinion that this so-called edict of Domitian was
apocryphal. It appears certainly, however, to have been the case that
the policy of these earlier emperors was decidedly opposed to any
freedom of expression of thought. If it is the case that in the later
centuries of imperial rule there are fewer instances of punishments of
writers or orders for the suppression of literature, the explanation
may be that literary activity had already been substantially repressed.
Justinian deposed from office Severus and certain other bishops
because they had been lax in their supervision of literature, and had
permitted the wide circulation throughout the realm of prohibited
books and pernicious writings. With the development of the Church of
Rome to the ecclesiastical headship of the world, the claim for the
supervision of literature and for the control of the productions of
authors was asserted by the Church as the legitimate successor of the
imperial authority. It is the opinion of Lea that the earliest act of
censorship, and perhaps the most sweeping, of the Christian Church
is that contained in the “Apostolic Constitutions” which purport to
have been written by St. Clement of Rome at the dictation of the
Apostles. These prefigure the Index by forbidding the Christians to
read any books of the Gentiles;--“the Scriptures should suffice for the
believer.”[14]

The following schedule of the more representative and important of
the prohibitions of the early Church is based chiefly on the record
presented by Reusch.

_150_ A. D. (_about_). _A synod of bishops of Asia Minor_, meeting
either at Ephesus or at Smyrna, prohibits the _Acta Pauli_. The _Acta
Pauli_ was an historical romance written about the middle of the 2d
century and having for its purpose the glorification of the life and
labours of St. Paul. The text of a portion of the work has recently
been produced in facsimile, from a Coptic manuscript, by Professor Carl
Schmidt of Heidelberg. The book is referred to by Eusebius and also
by Photius, who writes in the middle of the 9th century. There is an
earlier reference by Tertullian in his work on baptism, written about
200. According to Father Shahan, the work was condemned on the ground
that, although apparently the work of an “orthodox” Christian, it did
not present an authentic record. Notwithstanding this condemnation,
the _Acta Pauli_ continued throughout the earlier centuries of the
Church to secure circulation among Christians. This action of the
bishops of Asia Minor appears to be the first recorded instance of
ecclesiastical censorship of a work classed as heretical or at least as
not authentic.[15]

_325._ _The Council of Nicæa_ prohibits the _Thalia_ of Arius.

_325._ _The Emperor Constantine_ issues an edict directing the
destruction of the godless books of Porphyry and of the writings of
Arius. The penalty of death was ordered for any who might conceal
copies.

_398._ _The Emperor Arcadius_ issues an edict ordering, under penalty
of death, the destruction of the books of the Eunomians.

_399._ _Arcadius_ issues an edict ordering the destruction under
penalty of death (_humiliores capite puniuntur_) of all books of
magic art. These edicts of Arcadius were the result of the action
of the first two councils of the Church. It seems evident that the
extreme penalties prescribed in the Roman law for those who should
use or distribute books of magic were, under the influence of the
ecclesiastics, utilised for the repression of their theological
opponents.

_399._ _The Council of Alexandria_, under Bishop Theophilus, issues a
decree forbidding the owning or the reading of the books of Origen.
The Egyptian monks protested and the bishops were obliged to call in
the aid of the prefects to restore order in the council and to agree
to enforce its authority. It is to be noted that the service of the
secular government was required to secure the enforcement of this edict.

_402._ _Innocent I_ writes: “I have read through the treatise of
Pelagius. I found in this much that was antagonistic to the Grace of
God, much that was blasphemous, and hardly anything that was deserving
of approval. The book is one the evil influence of which each believer
ought to be able to recognise for himself and to condemn.” This papal
utterance is, of course, not to be classed as a prohibition. I make
place for it in the schedule because it is an early expression of the
literary policy that is now, fifteen centuries after Innocent, being
followed by the Church, namely, to characterise pernicious books and
to place upon believers the responsibility of condemning them for
themselves.

_431._ _The Council of Ephesus_ condemns the errors and the writings of
the Nestorians.

_435._ _The Emperor Theodosius_ issues an edict forbidding the
possession, the reading, or the copying of the Nestorian books, and
ordering existing copies to be delivered up for burning.[16]

_436._ _Theodosius_ issues an edict forbidding the possession and the
reading of the books of the Manichaeans and ordering the burning of the
same.[17]

_446._ _Pope Leo I_ issues an edict ordering destruction of the books
of Porphyry and of Origen, and the writings of the Nestorians, the
Manichaeans, the Eunomians, the Montanists, the Eutychians, and all
others which were antagonistic to the Christian religion, and which
were not in accord with the teachings of the Synods of Nicaea and
Ephesus. The prohibition reads: “Whoever owns or reads these books is
to suffer extreme punishment.”

_494._ Under _Pope Gelasius I_, was issued what is afterwards referred
to as the first papal Index. It was a catalogue of works prohibited,
and is so cited in the Decretals of Gratian. It was, however, not
properly a prohibitory Index, in that it has to do, not with private
and general, but with public or official reading.

_496._ _Pope Gelasius_ issues a decree, published at a council of
Rome, and confirmed in a decree of Gratian, which specifies the
patristic writings accepted and approved by the Church, and which
then proceeds to the condemnation of a long series of apocryphal
and heretical writings and writers. These writings are specified as
follows: “_Haec et omnia his similia non solum repudiata, verum etiam
ab omni Romana catholica et apostolica ecclesia eliminata atque cum
suis auctoribus auctorumque sequacibus sub anathematis indissolubili
vinculo in aeternum confitemur esse damnata._”[18] This decree, known
as the _Decretum Gelasianum_, is sometimes referred to as the earliest
example of an Index emanating from the Church. It is, however, an Index
only in a restricted sense of the term, as it does not order a general
prohibition of the reading of the works specified but calls simply for
their rejection and condemnation. The phrase _omnia his similia_ is
curiously vague for an Index specification.

_536._ _The Emperor Justinian_, as a result of a condemnation by the
Synod of Constantinople, orders the burning of the books of Severus.
The manifolding of these books is prohibited under a penalty for the
scribe of the loss of his writing hand.[19] It appears from these
and from similar examples that, according to the practice of the two
centuries after Constantine, the responsibility for the condemnation
of heretical writings was assumed by the councils, while the work of
prohibiting the books, of destroying the copies, and of punishing those
who retained copies was carried out under the authority of the emperor.

_649._ _Pope Martin I_ issues a decree condemning and prohibiting
certain heretical literature.

_681._ _The Council of Constantinople_ issues a decree condemning
certain heretical literature and ordering all copies of the same to
be burned. This is the first instance in which, in place of referring
the matter to the secular authority, a council had itself ordered the
destruction of the condemned books.

_692._ _The Council of Trulla_ issues an edict ordering the burning of
certain histories of the martyrs, which had been produced in versified
form.[20]

_755._ _The Council of Rome_ issues an edict ordering the burning of
certain condemned writings of Adelbert. Pope Zacharius took the ground,
however, that it would be wiser to preserve the offending books in
the archives of the Papacy, _ad reprobationem et ad perpetuam ejus
confusionem_.

_768._ An authorisation is granted by _Pope Stephen III_ to Ambrosius
Autpert, a Benedictine monk, for a treatise the title of which is not
given. In his application, Autpert states that he is the first author
who has sought for his work the approval of the Head of the Church; and
that he is anxious to keep his writings in accord with the teachings of
the Fathers of the Church.[21]

_787._ _The second Council of Nicaea_ issues an edict ordering the
destruction of certain “falsified utterances of the Martyrs” which had
been prepared by “enemies of the Church.”

_814._ _The Patriarch Nicephorus_ orders the destruction in
Constantinople of similar falsified acts of the Martyrs. The number of
such censorship edicts in the early Church is not considerable, but it
is to be remembered that through the lack of knowledge of reading, the
faithful were, during these centuries, fairly well protected against
any evil influence from pernicious literature.




                              CHAPTER III

         THE PROHIBITION OF BOOKS IN THE MIDDLE AGES 830–1480


During the period known as the Middle Ages, a period which, for
the purposes of this study, can be considered as comprising the
centuries from the 9th to the 15th, a long series of condemnations
and prohibitions of books were ordered by various ecclesiastical
authorities. The brief list here given, as a link in the record of
Church censorship, presents certain types or examples of the attempts
made, in advance of any system of general Indexes, to supervise,
control, and restrict the production and distribution of literature.

_830–840._ During these years, measures were taken against Claudius,
Bishop of Turin, and Agobardus, Archbishop of Lyons, on the ground of
their heretical writings, but these last were not formally condemned.

_849._ Gottschalk, a German monk, was, at the instance of Hincmar,
Archbishop of Rheims, excommunicated and condemned to imprisonment for
life, on the ground of his treatise against certain doctrines of St.
Augustine. Gottschalk died in a dungeon about 869. The Index of 1559
places Claudius in the first class, in which he has the honour of being
the earliest author. This entry is continued in the Index of 1564 and
later. The name of Agobardus first finds place in the Index of 1605,
and there only in connection with the _editio princeps_ of his works
printed in 1605. The edition of 1666, and the later issues, failed
to receive formal condemnation. Gottschalk’s treatise escaped the
attention of the Index compilers.

_1050._ _The Synod of Vercelli_ condemns the treatise by Berengar of
Tours on the Lords Supper, and also the work by Ratramnus of Corbu
(written some two centuries earlier) entitled _De Corpore et Sanguine
Christi_.[22] The former book came under various later condemnations.

_1059._ _A Synod at Rome_ compels Berengar himself to burn the thesis
he had written in defence of his position.

_1120._ _A Synod at Soissons_ compels Abelard to burn his treatise,
_Introductio in Theologiam_.

_1140._ _Innocent III_ orders the burning of the writings of Abelard
and of Arnold of Brescia, and the confinement of the two authors in
monasteries.

_1148._ _A Synod at Rheims_ condemns four chapters of the Commentary
by Gilbert de la Porrée on the treatise by Boethius, _de Trinitate_.
Gilbert had proposed to make in the book such corrections as the pope
might order; but the pope had refused to assume the task. Hefele speaks
of this as the first known instance of an attempt to relieve a text
from condemnation by means of expurgation. Gilbert does not find place
in any of the official Indexes but is recorded by Lutzenburg.

_1209._ _A Synod at Paris_ condemns the _Physion_ of Amalric (Amaury)
of Chartres (who had died five years earlier), excommunicates the
writer, and orders his remains to be cast out of their resting place
in consecrated ground. Amaury had undertaken to identify the Divine
Nature with the primary matter of Aristotle. A number of the followers
of Amaury were, in December, 1210, burned under the commands of Philip
Augustus.

_1209._ _The Synod of Paris_ condemns the writings of David of Dinant.
It also forbids, under pain of excommunication, the reading of the _de
Metaphysica_ until it had been expurgated.

_1215._ _The Lateran Council_ condemns the same work.

_1215._ _The fourth Synod of the Lateran_ condemns the tractate written
by the Abbot Joachim against Peter Lombard. Joachim had died in 1202.
The decree reads: “Any one who shall attempt to defend the heretical
utterances of the said Joachim concerning the Trinity shall be thrust
out as a heretic.” It was ordered that the writings of Joachim were to
be submitted to the Curia for correction.

_1225._ _A Synod at Sens_ passes condemnation on the treatise by Scotus
Erigena (written about 860), _De Divisione Naturae_. Pope Honorius
confirmed this condemnation and ordered that all persons possessing
copies of the book must, under penalty of excommunication, deliver
the same, within fifteen days, to the ecclesiastical authorities for
burning.[23]

_1231._ _Pope Gregory IX_ writes to the University of Paris directing
the prohibition of the _Libri naturales_ of Aristotle, as condemned by
the Provincial Council, until they have been freed from heresies.

_1276._ _Bishop Stephen Tempier_, under instructions from the Pope
(John XXI), and in council with the prelates of his diocese, publishes
a condemnation of 219 propositions which had been under discussion in
the Schools. The judgment states, rather naïvely, that while they were
true philosophically, they were false when tested by the doctrine of
the Church. The bishops condemned at the same time a long series of
books on magic and necromancy and ordered all copies to be delivered
for destruction within seven days.

One of the teachers whose influence was most potent during the
middle of the 13th century against the heresies that were disturbing
university circles was the great schoolman Thomas Aquinas. A writer
in the Dublin _Review_ says that by his astounding powers of
reasoning, he turned the tide of scepticism in Paris, “whose vocation
it was to teach the world!”--Before the lectures of Aquinas began,
other measures had been used against the heretics: “Ten disciples of
the misbelieving David Dinanto were given over to the civil arm and
had perished in the flames.” Archbishop Vaughan says naïvely, “several
fanatics of low rank had to be burnt.”[24]

In 1300, Gherardo Segarelli, of Parma, the founder of the Apostolic
Brothers, was burned, together with such copies of his writings as had
been collected.

_1311._ The writings of Segarelli were formally condemned by the
_Council of Vienna_, a condemnation which was a year or two later
confirmed by John XXII. In 1471, that is, more than a century and a
half later, these same writings were formally approved by Sixtus IV,
the condemnation having been recalled.[25] This appears to be the first
instance on record in which a work condemned by one pope has later
received the approval of another.

_1316._ _The Inquisition in Tarragona_ condemns fourteen treatises of
the physician Arnold of Villanova (who had died in 1310), and orders
copies to be delivered under penalty of excommunication.

_1321._ _John XXII_ condemns twenty-eight propositions selected
from the writings of the Dominican Eckart. Seventeen are classed as
heretical and eleven as suspicious and dangerous.

_1325._ _John XXII_ issues a Bull against conjuring and exorcism, and
orders the delivery for destruction of all writings which contained any
teachings on these pernicious subjects.

_1327._ _John XXII_ issues a Bull condemning as heretics Marsilius
of Padua and John of Jaudun, and as heresy the book _Defensor Pacis_
of which they were joint authors and which he had had examined by
cardinals and canonists.

_1328._ _The Inquisition of Rome_ condemns as a heretic Cecco d’
Ascoli, who is burned together with his offending treatise, _de
Sphaera_.

_1328._ _John XXII_ condemns and orders destroyed the writings of the
Minorite Petrus Johannes Oliva, which had been examined and reported
upon by nine theologians. The bones of Oliva were disinterred and were
burned with copies of his books.[26] _In 1471_, _Sixtus IV_ (who was
himself a Minorite) orders the writings of Oliva to be again examined
and declares them to be sound in their doctrine.

_1328._ _John XXII_ condemns in like manner the Minorite General
Michael of Cesena, William of Occam, and Bonagratia of Bergamo, and all
their writings.

_1330._ _The Theological Faculty of Heidelberg_ condemns the teachings
of Eckart.

_1348._ _Pope Clement VI_ condemns a series of the theological
propositions of the Paris theologian, Nicholas de Ultricuria (de
Autrecourt). Nicholas was ordered to abjure these heresies and to burn
all copies of the writings.[27]

_1374._ _Pope Gregory XI_, as a result of an examination made by
certain cardinals and theologians, condemns as false, schismatic,
and heretical, and as _contra bonos mores_, fourteen articles of the
_Sachsenspiegel_. The Bull was directed to the Archbishops of Mayence,
Cologne, Bremen, Magdeburg, Prague, and Riga. The _Sachsenspiegel_ was,
however, never placed on the Index.

_1378._ _Gregory XI_, as a result of a denunciation by the Inquisitor,
Nicholas Eymeric, condemned two hundred propositions selected from
twenty treatises of Raymond Lully (who had died in 1315). In 1419, the
papal legate in Spain characterises this Bull as having been secured
under false representations, and as not to be regarded. After that
time, there were numerous bitter controversies over the precise status
of Lully’s writings, controversies in which the orthodoxy of Lully was
maintained by the Franciscans, while the soundness of the denunciation
of Eymeric was upheld by the Dominicans. Paul IV placed Lully in Class
II of his Index: but his name was omitted from the Index of Trent.
In 1580 and in 1620, question again arose as to placing Lully on the
Index, but the suggestion was withdrawn at the instance of the Spanish
court.

_1387._ _King Richard II_ prohibits, under penalty of imprisonment
and confiscation of property, the sale or purchase of the heretical
writings of Wyclif (who had died in 1384) and of Nicholas Hereford.

_1408._ _The Convocation of Canterbury_, under the direction of
Archbishop Arundel, prohibits the reading of any writings of Wyclif,
or of “any other writings of his time,” until the same had been passed
upon and expurgated by censors appointed by the Universities of Oxford
and Cambridge, and the expurgated texts had been approved by the
archbishop.[28]

_1415._ _The Council of Constance_ condemns as heretical the writings
of John Wyclif. It is forbidden, under pain of excommunication, to read
them or to make citations from them (except for the purpose of refuting
their errors); and the bishops are ordered to cause all copies to be
collected and burned.

The council takes similar action in regard to the writings of John
Huss, copies of which were publicly burned. In the year following, the
same fate came upon Huss himself, and also upon Jerome of Prague.

_1435._ _The Council of Basel_ condemns a work by Augustinus Favorini,
Prior General of the Augustinian Eremites. The book was characterised
by Cardinal Torquemada as unwholesome and heretical. The author
appealed to the Pope (Eugenius IV) who, against the protest of the
council, referred the book to a committee of investigation. The report
of the committee is not on record, but it was probably unfavourable, as
the book (which was never printed) stands, since 1559, on the Index.

_1459._ _Pope Pius II_, at the demand of the Inquisition, condemns the
writings of Pecock, Bishop of Chichester (charged with Wycliffian
heresies), and orders copies of the same to be delivered for burning.

_1460._ _Pius II_ condemns certain “Hussite” writings of Gregory of
Heimburg and, in _1461_, the condemnation is repeated in a _Bulla
Coenae_.

_1463._ _Pope Pius II_ (_Aeneas Sylvius_) issues a Bull entitled _In
Minoribus Agentes_, directed to the University of Cologne. In this
Bull, Pius takes the ground that the tractate on the Council of Basel,
written by him before his elevation to the Papacy, (which he points
out he had previously withdrawn) is to be considered as cancelled. He
disapproves of the opinions therein presented. He says further to the
university: “In case you may find among writings of mine (and I have
in my younger days been responsible for many) any that are unsound
or are likely to prove pernicious, these should be pointed out and
condemned.”[29]

In the Index of 1559 is placed not the work above referred to, but the
_Commentarium de Concilio Basileensi_, by Aeneas Sylvius. In the
Index of Trent is the entry:

“_In Actis Aeneae Sylvii prohibentur ea quae ipse in Bulla
retractationis damnavit, Ben. in: Piccolominens, Commentariorum de
concilio Basil. Corrigantur ea quae ipse in B. r. d._”

Reusch points out that, as no corrected edition was ever issued, these
two works of Pius II must be considered as still under condemnation.
His “Letters” and other writings (some of which he had also disavowed)
escaped formal condemnation.

_1468._ _Paul II_ excommunicates Gregory of Heimburg on the ground of
his treatise on the Papacy. Gregory’s name fails, however, to find a
place either in the catalogues of Lutzenburg, or in any of the Indexes,
although this treatise was reprinted in 1555.[30]

_1479._ _Sixtus IV_ gives authority to Carillo, Archbishop of Toledo,
to bring to trial Pedro Martinez de Osma, professor in Salamanca, by
reason of the heresies in his tract _De Confessione_. Pedro recants
his heresies, and the archbishop orders all copies of the book to be
burned. The university is enjoined to take measures to such end. Sixtus
confirms this proceeding in 1480, by a Bull. In the same year, Pedro
dies. His name is not included in any Index, either Spanish or general.

_1480._ _The Inquisition of Mayence_ brings to trial Johann Ruchrath of
Overwesel (de Wesalia) on the ground of certain _Paradoxa_ contained
in his sermons, and of his tractates on the authority of the Church,
absolution, etc. Ruchrath recanted and was, therefore, spared from
death but condemned to imprisonment for life. He died in 1481. The
books were burned. The name of Wesalia appears, since 1559, in the
first class of the papal Indexes.

=Prohibitions of Hebrew Writings.= In the centuries preceding the
institution of the Indexes, the _Talmud_ and the other doctrinal
writings of the Hebrews came repeatedly under the prohibitions of the
Church.

_1239._ _Pope Gregory IX_ orders the burning of all copies of the
_Talmud_. Graetz states that the antagonism of the authorities was at
the outset directed against the Babylonian _Gemara_, and against the
_Mischna_ only when this was associated with the _Gemara_.[31] As a
result of a denunciation by the converted Jew, Nicholas de Rupella,
Gregory sent, in 1239, letters to the kings and archbishops of France,
England, Spain, and Portugal, ordering that, on a specified day, all
copies of these books were to be delivered to the Dominicans and
the Minorites, and that if they were found to contain the heresies
described by Nicholas, they were to be burned. Reusch says that this
order was carried out only in France.

_1244._ _Innocent IV_ orders Louis IX to burn all copies of the
Talmudic writings to be found in his kingdom. Later, on the protest
of the Jews of France, the Pope directed Cardinal Odo to make a fresh
examination of the texts, and in so far as it could be done without
injury to the Christian faith, to permit copies to be retained by
the Jews themselves. In 1248, after a further investigation by Odo
and forty scholars (including Albertus Magnus), Odo again orders the
destruction of the books.

_1254._ _Louis IX_ issues renewed orders for the burning of copies of
the _Talmud_ and of other Hebrew books containing blasphemies.

_1267._ _Clement IV_ sends, by the hand of the Dominican Paulus
Christianus, a converted Jew, letters to the Archbishop of Tarragona,
ordering the destruction of the books of the Jews, and especially
_librum quem vocant Talmutz_.

_1415._ _Benedict XIII_ orders all copies of the Talmudic books to be
delivered to the bishop of the diocese and by him to be preserved,
subject to the instructions of the Curia. The Jews are forbidden to
possess copies of any works which contain assaults on the Christian
faith.[32] In the quarter-century between 1495 and 1520 (a term which
included the Papacy of Leo X), on the other hand, there was in Italy
a keen interest in Cabbalistic studies. Editions of the _Mischna_ and
of the Jerusalem _Talmud_ were printed in Venice and in Florence; the
Babylonian _Talmud_ was printed by Bomberg in Venice in 1520, 1522,
with a papal privilege, and the demand proved sufficient to call for a
reprinting in 1546.[33]

_1555._ _The Inquisition of Rome_ orders the confiscation of copies of
the Talmudic books from the houses of the Jews, and the investigation
of the texts by theologians. The rabbis were themselves interrogated
as to the purport of the books. As a result of this investigation, the
books were burned on the 9th of September (the Jewish New Year’s day).

_1555._ _Julius III_ publishes an edict directing all princes, bishops,
and inquisitors to confiscate and destroy by fire all copies of the
“Talmuds” of Jerusalem and of Babylon. Christians are forbidden, under
pain of excommunication, to possess or to read these books, or to aid
the Jews in producing copies by script or by printing.[34]

_1559._ _Paul IV._ The Roman Index of this year includes among books
prohibited the _Talmud_ of the Jews, with all commentaries, glosses,
and interpretations. In the same year, Ghislieri, Inquisitor-General,
orders the burning of all copies. Sixtus of Siena was sent to Cremona,
where there was a great Hebrew school and where was kept in store
a supply of copies of the Talmudic books. Sixtus reports that he
destroyed of these 12,000 volumes.[35]

_1564._ _Pius IV._ In the Index of Trent, the prohibition of Paul
IV is repeated, with the proviso that if the Talmudic scriptures
(referring probably to the _Talmud_ of Jerusalem rather than to that of
Babylon) are printed without the name of _Talmud_, and have eliminated
from them all assaults on the Christian faith, they may be permitted.
Graetz states that in October, 1563, the Jewish congregations had
sent two deputies to Trent to secure the omission from the Index
of the _Talmud_ and the other works of Hebrew doctrine; or if this
could not be accomplished, that the decision concerning the form of
prohibition or regulation should be reserved for the authority of the
Curia. The latter course was adopted by the council, and the Pope,
for a substantial consideration in money, issued a Bull (March 24,
1564) permitting the printing and the circulation of an expurgated
_Talmud_.[36]

_1565._ _The Inquisition of Rome_ (according to the tractate of Sixtus
printed in 1566) condemns and orders destroyed all books having to do
with the “Cabbala.”

_1592._ _Clement VIII_ issues a Bull forbidding both Christians and
Jews from owning, reading, buying, or circulating the Talmudic and
Cabbalistic books and other godless writings, whether written or
printed, in Hebrew or in other languages, which contained heresies or
assaults upon Christian doctrines or upon the practices of the Church.
The possessors of such books were not to be excused on the plea that
the texts had been expurgated or were to be expurgated. The authority
extended by Pius IV for such expurgation was recalled. The substance
of this Bull was printed in the Index of Clement issued in 1596. In
the same year, however, Clement issued a brief permitting the use
of certain specified rabbinical books, when they had been verified
as containing nothing directly antagonistic to the doctrines of the
Church. In the Index of 1596, and in the succeeding Roman Indexes,
stands a special provision concerning the book _Mazazor_ (_Machsor_)
which contains in part the offices and ceremonials of the synagogue.
This is forbidden in any editions printed in the vernacular, that is in
any language other than Hebrew.

_1775._ _Pope Clement XIV_ issues an edict in which are cited the Bulls
of Innocent IV, Julius III, and Clement VIII, and their prohibitions
are confirmed. Rabbis and Jews generally were forbidden to possess
copies of the Talmudic and Cabbalistic books and of any others which
contained heresies or utterances against the Christian faith. No Hebrew
books were to be bought or sold until they had been examined and
approved by the _Magister Palatii_ in Rome, or, outside of Rome, by the
bishop or inquisitor. The penalty was a fine of one hundred scudi and
seven years’ imprisonment.[37]

            REGULATIONS AFFECTING BOOKS, FROM THE BEGINNING
            OF PRINTING TO THE DATE OF THE EARLIEST INDEXES

    1. General       1450–1560.
    2. England       1526–1555.
    3. Netherlands   1521–1550.
    4. France        1521–1551.
    5. Spain         1521–1551.
    6. Germany       1521–1555.


=1. General.=--The great impetus given to the distribution of books
by the work of the printing-press had as one result a fresh effort
at supervision and control on the part of the Church of literary
production. The first measures that were put into shape for the
enforcement of such control provided for what has been called
preventive censorship, that is a requirement, before the printed book
could be put into circulation, of an examination and approval by
ecclesiastical authorities. It was, however, not until half a century
after Gutenberg had printed his first book, that official cognisance
was taken of the new art in a papal Bull.

_1479._ _Sixtus V_ authorised the Rector and Dean of the University
of Cologne to impose the penalties of the Church upon those printing,
selling, or reading heretical works. This authorisation was confirmed
by Alexander VI. In 1501, the printers of Cologne sent a representative
to Rome to protest against the censorship of the university
authorities, which was driving their business out of the city.[38]

_1480._ There was published in Venice a _Nosce te ipsum_ in which
are printed four “approvals,”[39] and in the same year, a volume was
printed at Heidelberg with a privilege from the Patriarch of Venice.[40]

_1486._ _Berthold, Archbishop of Mayence_, issues an edict prohibiting
the printing in his diocese of any translation from Latin or Greek, or
of any books in the vernacular, until the same had been approved by
the heads of the four faculties in the University of Erfurt.[41] The
ground for this prohibition was that a “number of works had recently
been disseminated which contained heresies and errors,” or which were
printed under false titles, or which presented translations of the
liturgies and Mass-books such as “were not fitting for the people.”

The Bull of Innocent VIII, issued in 1487 and directed to the
authorities of the University of Cologne, is described by Hilgers as
the first general papal censorship regulation. “With the misuse of
the printing-press for the distribution of pernicious writings, the
regulations of the Church for the protection of the faithful enter of
necessity upon a new period. It is certainly the case that the evil
influence of a badly conducted printing-press constitutes to-day the
greatest danger to society. This new flood is drawn from three chief
sources. Theism and unbelief arise from the regions of natural science,
of philosophy, and of Protestant theology. Theism is the assured result
of what is called ‘scientific liberty.’ Anarchism and nihilism,
religious as well as political, may be described as the second source,
from which pours out a countless stream of socialistic writings. In
substance this is nothing other than a popularised philosophy of
liberalism. The third source, the foulest and most pernicious of all,
streams forth from the unwholesome romances of the day, romances whose
creations rest on the foundations of pornography. If the community is
to be protected from demoralisation, the political authorities must
unite with the ecclesiastical in securing for such utterances some wise
and safe control.”[42]

_1491._ _Niccolo Franco, Bishop of Treviso_, and papal Legate
to Venice, puts into print in Venice a “Constitution,” which is
described as the first printed regulation of the Church having to do
with censorship. It is also noteworthy as containing the earliest
prohibition of printed books. The Bishop states that he has evidence
that the printers are bringing before the public works, tainted with
heresy, which are likely to bring into peril the souls of believers. He
feels that the responsibility rests upon him, as the representative of
the Church, to withstand this evil. He therefore orders that hereafter
no books shall be brought into print, having to do with matters of
faith or of the authority of the Church, without the approval and
permission of the bishop or vicar-general of the diocese. Whoever
disobeys this injunction shall, without further action, come under the
penalty of excommunication.[43]

Apart from the general injunction in this “Constitution,” it contains
a specific prohibition of the treatise on Monarchy by Antonio Roselli,
and of the theses of Pico della Mirandola. Those who have printed
or who may hereafter print these works, or who may have bought or
come into the possession of copies, are ordered, under penalty of
excommunication, to deliver such copies at once for destruction.
Roselli was professor of law in Siena and later in Padua. His treatise
_De Monarchia_ had been printed in Venice in 1483 and in 1487. His
name stands in all the Roman Indexes except in that of Trent, and
thereafter with the proviso _donec corrigatur_. Pico escaped official
classification as a heretic and no one of his writings finds place in
the Index. In 1487, he had brought before the public no less than nine
hundred theses which he was prepared to defend against all critics. The
pope ordered an examination to be made of these theses (propositions)
by a commission of theologians and jurists. The commission found
that thirteen of the theses were tainted with heresy. Pico, while
maintaining the orthodoxy of his propositions, expressed his readiness
to submit himself to the judgment of the pope. Six years later, he was
able to secure from Alexander VI a further examination, conducted by
three cardinals and the _Magister Palatii_, and on the report of this
commission, the pope declared Pico to be free from suspicion of heresy.

_1501._ _Alexander VI_, in a Bull entitled _Inter Multiplices_,
addressed to the Archbishop of Magdeburg and to the rulers of the
three ecclesiastical principalities, says: “The art of printing can
be of great service in so far as it furthers the circulation of
useful and tested books; but it can bring about serious evils if it
is permitted to widen the influence of pernicious works. It will,
therefore, be necessary to maintain full control over the printers
so that they may be prevented from bringing into print writings
which are antagonistic to the Catholic faith, or which are likely to
cause trouble to believers.” The Bull proceeds to state that in the
dioceses of Cologne, Mayence, Treves, and Magdeburg many books and
tracts are being sent out from the presses which contain pernicious
errors, wrong doctrine, and heresies; and prohibits, under pain of
the excommunication _latae sententiae_, any further printing of such
books, and also the possession or perusal of the same. The bishops
and inquisitors are charged with the execution of the decree; and
are ordered to enforce its provisions against all persons, whatever
their rank or positions, and also against colleges, universities, and
associations, with the threat that, in case of opposition or evasion,
the penalties shall be sharpened and multiplied. The civil powers are
to be invoked if necessary, and in order to strengthen the interest
of the local authorities, they are to receive one half the amounts of
the penalties collected in money. The above ordinance had to do only
with the German provinces specified. Even at this early date, the city
of Magdeburg appears to have secured repute for the production of
heretical literature.

_1512._ _The Inquisition of the Netherlands_ condemns as a heretic
Magistrate Hermann of Ryswick, who is burned at The Hague together with
his books. His name stands in the Index in Class I, although not even
the titles of his heretical writings have been preserved.

_1513._ _The “Constitution” of Leo X_, issued in December, on the
subject of the immortality of the soul, concerns itself with the misuse
of the philosophers and poets of classic times for the undermining of
faith and morality. The Pope emphasises the importance of purifying
the roots or foundations of philosophy and poetry as taught in the
universities. In the third part of the Constitution, attention is given
to the principles under which must be carried on the education of the
young. It is essential that a careful selection be made for their use
from classical writings so that only those books shall be brought to
their knowledge which are free from immorality.

_1515._ _Albert, Archbishop of Mayence_, appoints Paul, Bishop of
Ascalon, to be “Commissary” for the examination and censorship of books
submitted for printing privileges. Bishop Paul and Canon Trutfetter
were further instructed to act at Erfurt as inquisitors of heresy, and
were authorised to prohibit the sale of bad and suspicious books.[44]

_1515._ _Leo X_, in a Lateran council of May 3d, issues the Bull
_Inter Solicitudines_, which concerns itself in like manner with
the service and the perils of the printing art. In this Bull, it is
ordered that no work should be put into print until its text had been
examined and approved by the authorities of the Church, in Rome by
the papal Vicar or the _Magister Sacri Palatii_, elsewhere by the
bishop or the inquisitor-general or by examiners authorised by them.
The privilege to print must, however, bear the original signature of
one of the higher officials. This signature must, under penalty of
excommunication, be given without delay, and without consideration
for a work not presenting ground for disapproval. (The Pope knew
his officials and evidently realised what would be the risk and the
tendency of the working of such a system.) Whoever may attempt to evade
the regulation and may print books without a privilege shall forfeit
for burning the books so printed, and shall pay 100 ducats to the
building fund of St. Peter’s, and his printing office shall be closed
for the term of one year. If he remain obstinate and unrepentant, he
shall be excommunicated, and shall further be so chastened that others
may take warning by the example. Before the issue of this papal Bull,
certain local ordinances had been put into effect for the control of
the printing-press in the centres where the new art was showing the
greatest activity.

One Bishop, Alexius of Melfi, voted against this Bull, with the proviso
_placet de novis operibus, non autem de antiquis_.[45]

This Bull of Leo X served as a model for a long series of future
similar ecclesiastical orders. The fatherly care for the true faith
and for the preservation of the morality of Christendom are, in the
wording of this papal utterance, placed in the background, while the
main contention is devoted to the assertion of the authority of the
pope and of the special responsibility of the pope, as the immediate
representative of God, for the maintenance of censorship throughout the
world. The single German prince who was willing to confirm this Bull
was the Elector Albert of Saxony. The enforcement of the regulations of
the papal Bulls proved to be difficult and usually impracticable unless
the aid could be secured of the machinery of the civil administration.

In the year 1513, began a series of attacks against Johannes Reuchlin,
attacks which continued for seven years. Reuchlin’s treatise _Der
Augenspiegel_, which had been printed in 1511, was, in 1513, condemned
as heretical by the Universities of Louvain, Cologne, Mayence, and
Erfurt. In the year following, the theological faculty of the
University of Paris declared the book to be tainted with heresy.

It was ordered that existing copies (presumably those available in
France) were to be burned and that the author was to be called upon to
recant.

In 1513, at the instance of Jacob Hoogstraten, the Inquisition
initiated a “process” against Reuchlin. The decision was adverse to
Reuchlin, who appealed to the Pope (Leo X). Leo referred the matter
to the Bishop of Speyer, who gave judgment in favour of Reuchlin,
declaring that the book was deserving of being read by every one.
There followed a series of appeals and of conflicting decisions. In
June, 1520, however, Cardinals Accolti and Giacobazzi, whom the Pope
had appointed judges, decided that the judgment of the bishop must be
revoked, that the book was to be condemned and destroyed, and that
Reuchlin was to be ordered to keep silence. While the _Augenspiegel_
was still the text of the proceedings, the contest had now widened
its range, and turned upon the whole relations of Reuchlin’s work
as a scholar and an instructor, and particularly upon his advocacy
of the study of Hebrew. (In the _Augenspiegel_ itself, the wisdom
of preserving instead of destroying the _Talmud_ is maintained.)
Leo X spoke with approval of Reuchlin’s writings and forbade their
condemnation. In the Vatican Index the name of Reuchlin stands in Class
I, all of his works being thus placed under condemnation. In the Index
of Paul, are entered the _Augenspiegel_, _De Verbo Mirifico_, and
_Ars Cabbalistica_, and these titles are repeated in the succeeding
Indexes (excepting those of Louvain, 1546, 1550, 1558). In the Index
of Benedict XIV (1758), the title of the _Augenspiegel_ is, curiously
enough, recorded only in French. The compilers of the Indexes were
evidently not influenced by the liberal views of Pope Leo.

_1517._ _Leo X_, in a special brief written by Sadoletus, condemns
the _Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum_. The _Epistolae_ first find place,
however, in the Index in 1590.

_1521._ When the authorities of the Roman Church and the Catholic
princes of Europe had become thoroughly aroused and alarmed by the
development of Protestantism, the famous contract was entered into
between Leo and the Emperor Charles V which was to repress the
Reformation. One of the most important provisions in this contract had
to do with the control of the press and placed at the disposal of the
ecclesiastical censors the full measure of the imperial authority.
With the publication of the Edict of Worms, we have the beginning of
a general imperial censorship for Germany. From this time the Church
and the State (or at least the Catholic portion of the State,) worked
together against the freedom of the press, freedom which involved not
only heresy against orthodoxy, but treason against the State.

About 1520, Nicholas Eymeric brought into print in Venice, under the
title of _Directorium Inquisitorium_, a list of books classed as
heretical. It does not appear under what authority this classification,
or condemnation, had been arrived at, but the list proved of importance
in the history of the Index, as the titles collected by Eymeric were
utilised for the famous catalogue of Lutzenberg, which itself served
as the basis for the Louvain Index of 1546. The Lutzenberg titles were
also in large part copied by the compiler of the Index of Paul IV. No
copy of the original issue of Eymeric’s _Directorium_ appears to
have been preserved. The work is known through the reprint issued in
Venice in 1607, with the commentary by Franciscus Pegna.

The catalogue of Bernard Lutzenburg was printed in Cologne in 1520,
under the title of _Catalogus Haereticorum_.


=2. Regulations in England in Regard to Book-Production and
Censorship, 1526–1555.=--During the years covering the reign of Henry
VIII, a series of royal edicts were issued for the regulation of
heretical publications. The larger part of these edicts were framed
in consultation with the convocation of bishops. Regulations issued
under the sole authority of the bishops occur only after the rise of
Lutheranism.

_1521._ _Wareham, Archbishop of Canterbury_, writes to Cardinal Wolsey
asking that the names of the associates of Luther might be sent to the
University of Oxford, in order that their writings might be added to
the lists of prohibited books, and might also be included among the
works the reading of which was to be permitted under special license to
the scholars engaged in refuting the Lutheran heresies.[46]

_1526._ _Wareham_ sends to Duvoisey, Bishop of Exeter, a mandate
directing him to make search for certain English translations of the
New Testament, which are “full of heretical pravity.” The copies
secured are to be burned. The mandate includes, in addition to this
reference to the New Testament, the titles of certain writings by
“Luther, Tyndal, Huss, and Zwingle.”[47]

Fox makes reference to a similar instruction from Tonstal, Bishop of
London, to the archdeacons of his diocese. Tonstal specifies the same
titles as those given in the list of Wareham.

_1526._ _Henry VIII_ orders the publication of a catalogue of forbidden
books which appears to be the first of the English prohibitions and,
if to be classed as an Index, would rank with the earliest of Europe.
The catalogue contains but eighteen titles, comprising certain of the
productions of Luther, Zwingli, and Brenz, the _In Oseam_ of Huss, and
four anonymous works. The editions referred to had been imported.[48]

_1529._ _Henry VIII_ authorises the publication of catalogue number
two, containing 85 works “imported by the adherents of heretical
sects.” The 85 titles include 22 by Luther, 2 by Wyclif, 11 by Zwingli,
9 by Oecolampadius, etc.

_1530._ _King Henry_ forbids the reading of the Scriptures in the
vernacular. In the proclamation, the King takes the ground that there
is no necessity for the reading of the Bible by the common people.
They can secure more safely from their religious instructors all the
Scripture teaching that is profitable. When the peril of the spread
of heretical opinions has passed, it will be in order to permit
translations of the Bible. For the present, however, all copies of the
versions in English, French, German, or Dutch are to be delivered to
the bishop.[49]

_1530._ _Henry VIII_, in a proclamation, forbids the printing,
importation, sale, or possession of books, whether printed or written,
which contain doctrines antagonistic to the Catholic faith, or to the
authority of the king, or to the laws of the land. The magistrates are
instructed to take all measures necessary to root out the heresies.
The proclamation enumerates further certain serious heresies in the
writings of English authors. The first of these, taken from _The Book
of the Wicked Mammon_, is: “Faith oonley doth justifie us.”[50] In a
second royal proclamation of the same year, special prohibition is
made of books printed abroad, all existing copies of which are to be
delivered at once to the bishops.[51]

_1531._ _A royal proclamation_ (_of Henry_), read at St. Paul’s Cross,
specifies thirty English works the selling and reading of which is
forbidden.

_1534._ _The convocation of Canterbury_ petitions the King to authorise
the preparation, by well qualified persons, of an English version
of the Bible, and to permit the use of the same by the people. The
King took no action in the matter, but after 1535, several more or
less complete translations came into publication, and in 1536, the
Vicar General, Cromwell, ordered that in each parish church should be
placed, securely fastened by a chain, a copy of the Coverdale Bible,
in the large form, so that the faithful might become familiar with the
text.[52]

_1536._ _King Henry_ (who had been excommunicated in 1535) revokes the
prohibition on the use of the Scriptures.[53]

_1538._ _King Henry_, in a proclamation, orders that the selling of
books shall be done only under royal permit or privilege. No books
shall be printed or imported without being examined and approved by
examiners appointed by the Crown. Every printed book must bear the
name of the printer and also that of the author, translator, or editor.
No English version of the Bible shall be printed without a permit from
the King or from the Privy Council. The penalties are imprisonment and
confiscation of property.[54]

_1539._ _King Henry_ makes special prohibition, under heavy penalties,
of the writings of the Sacramentarians and Anabaptists.

_1543._ _King Henry_ again orders that the Scriptures in the vernacular
be permitted only for the higher classes.

During Henry’s reign, were published nine catalogues of books
prohibited under the authority of the Crown. These lists have the
character of Indexes, but the titles are not arranged alphabetically.

The first edition of Fox’s _Acts and Monuments_, issued in 1539,
contains a “list of Condemned Books,” subjoined to certain
“Injunctions.” This list is omitted from the subsequent editions and is
not included by Wilkins, who reprints the “Injunctions.” The preamble
to the list reads as follows:

   “Hereafter folow the names of certen bokes, whiche, either after
   this injunction, or some other in the said Kinges daies, were
   prohibyted, the names of whiche bokes folowe in order expressed:

   Miles Coverdale, the whole Bible; George Joy; Theodore Baselle,
   alias Thomas Beacon; William Tindall; John Frith; Mels
   Coverdalle (bis); William Turner, translated by Fysh; Robert
   Barnes; Richard Tracy; John Bale, alias Haryson; John Goughe;
   Rederick Mors; Henry Stalbridg, otherwyse Bale; George Joy
   (bis); Urb. Regius; Apologia Melanchthonis; Romerani; Sawtrey;
   Luther, translated by Tindall.”[55]

_1546._ _Henry VIII_ (in the last year of his reign) issues a royal
“Proclamation for abolishing of certain English books.” The list
repeats nearly the same names, and is followed by an instrument of the
bishops, specifying at length the heresies to be condemned.

_1547._ _Edward VI_ orders the publication of a list of homilies and
books of worship, the use of which is made compulsory for church
service. Every priest is instructed to make diligent study of the New
Testament, both in Latin and in English, and to compare with this the
Paraphrases of Erasmus. Bishop Gardiner remonstrated, pointing out that
the homilies and the Paraphrases contradicted each other.[56]

_1549._ _King Edward_ orders the exclusive use of the official
Communion Book, and the bishops are instructed to cancel, in such
manner that they cannot again come into use, the liturgies of Sarum,
Lincoln, and York.[57] During Edward’s reign, no royal action was taken
in regard to censorship.

_1555._ _Philip and Mary._ In this year was issued a “proclamation by
the King and Queen” “for the restraining of all Books and Writings,
tending against the Doctrine of the Pope and his Church.” The
proclamation grounds itself upon a statute of the second year of Henry
IV, and condemns, usually simply with the name of the author, a number
of reformers, both foreign and English. Among the English works is
included the Chronicle of Hall. The “Proclamation” bears the imprint of
John Cawood.

_1556._ _The papal Legate, Cardinal Pole_, publishes a
“Reformation-Decree” in which are included the regulations of the
_Bulla Coenae_. It is further ordered that the bishops should
arrange for the examination of the booksellers’ shops, and for the
confiscation and destruction of all heretical writings.[58]

_1557._ _An edict of the convocation of the province of Canterbury_
repeats and confirms the royal condemnation. In 1558 (the last year of
the reign of Mary), is issued a further proclamation worded as follows:


                        “BY THE KING AND QUEEN.

   Whereas divers Books, filled with Heresie, Sedition, and
   Treason, have of late, and be dayly brought into this Realm out
   of foreign Countries and places beyond the seas, and some also
   covertly printed within this Realm, and cast abroad in sundry
   parts thereof, whereby not only God is dishonoured, but also an
   encouragement given to disoby lawfull Princes and Governors;
   the King and Queen’s Majesties, for redress hereof, do, by this
   present Proclamation, declare and publish to all their subjects,
   that whosoever shall, after the proclaiming hereof, be found
   to have any of the said wicked and seditious Books, or finding
   them, do not forthwith burn the same without shewing or reading
   the same to any other person, shall in that case be reputed and
   taken for a Rebel, and shall without delay be executed for that
   offence, according to the order of martial law.

   “Given at our Manor of Saint James the sixth day of June. John
   Cawood, Printer.”

_1558._ _Queen Mary_, in a proclamation issued in this (the last)
year of her reign, orders put into force the provisions of the _Bulla
Coenae_ and of the Fifth Lateran Council, and declares that all persons
shall be treated as rebels and punished under the penalties of martial
law who distribute or possess copies of godless or heretical books,
such as have been wrongfully brought in from foreign lands. With the
death of the Queen, later in the same year, these orders were revoked
by Elizabeth.

The author whose name appears most frequently in these English Indexes
is William Tyndale (alias Hichins). His translation of the New
Testament was first printed in Cologne in 1525, and was reissued later
in a great number of editions.

In 1563 was issued under the title of _The Acts and Monuments of the
Church_ a book generally known as Fox’s _Book of Martyrs_. This
work exercised probably a larger influence than any book of the century
in completing the conversion of England from Romanism to Protestantism,
an influence which continued through the following centuries.

_1564._ _Queen Elizabeth_ instructs the Bishop of London to cause
thorough examinations to be made of the cargoes of incoming ships, and
to confiscate and destroy copies of slanderous and seditious books.[59]

_1586._ _Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury_, authorises a bookseller
named Ascanius de Renialme to import copies of certain popish books,
with the restriction that these copies are to be carefully reserved
for the use of the Archbishop himself and of the members of the Privy
Council.

It is to be noted that the censorship control in England over the
productions of the press and the importation and sale of books
was from the outset exercised under the direct authority of the
Crown. The bishops were utilised for counsel and also, through the
parish organisation of their dioceses, for the enforcement of the
censorship and of the penalties. A little later, the machinery of
the Stationers’ Company, to which was given the practical control of
the printing-press, was employed for carrying out the policy of the
Crown in the restriction of the works printed and for enforcing the
regulations against delinquents. It is probable that these censorship
regulations of the English Crown were carried out more effectively
than was found possible for the similar regulations of the Church in
France, in Germany, or in Italy. In Spain alone did the Church succeed
in securing and for centuries in maintaining an absolute control over
printing, publishing, and book-distribution.

_1588._ _Queen Elizabeth_ issues a proclamation forbidding, under
severe penalties, the printing of schismatic, seditious, slanderous,
or fantastic works; existing copies of such works (the determination
of their character appears to have been left to the bishops) must
be delivered to the bishops for destruction.[60] Among the titles
specified of seditious books thus to be destroyed is that of a pamphlet
entitled _The Gaping Gulf_, which had to do with the scheme for the
marriage of the Queen with the Duke of Anjou.


=3. Regulations in the Netherlands for the Supervision of Books,
1521–1550.=--Between the years 1521 and 1550, a series of ordinances
for the regulation of the printing-press which were issued under the
instructions of Charles V, were published in the form of placards
throughout the Provinces. The regulations became each year more severe.
These ordinances were confirmed and strengthened by Philip II.

_1522._ _Charles V_ gives a special permit to Franz van der Hulst to
possess and to read books by Luther and by other heretics, for the
purpose of refuting their heresies. The regulations and orders above
specified are, it may be noted, issued under the sole authority of
the Emperor. There is no reference to the _Bulla Coenae_ or to any
other papal utterances. The prohibitions concerning literature issued
by the theological faculty of Louvain are based upon the authority and
instructions not of the pope, but of the Emperor. With the introduction
into the Netherlands of the Inquisition, however, the pope begins to
take part in the supervision of literature.

_1522._ _Charles V_ appoints Van der Hulst as Inquisitor. He is
confirmed by Adrian VI with the proviso that, as Van der Hulst is a
layman, he must have two ecclesiastics as assessors. The succeeding
inquisitors, who were all ecclesiastics, were in like manner appointed
by the emperor or by the stadtholder and confirmed by the pope. Several
of the edicts of Charles contain prohibitions of special books.

_1524._ An ordinance orders the delivery, for destruction, of copies of
heretical books, under penalty of confiscation of goods and corporal
punishment. In 1526, was added the penalty of banishment, and in 1529,
that of death.

The reports of the time speak of frequent bonfires of masses of
confiscated books. In 1526, it was ordered that no book should be
printed or imported without a permit from the imperial commissioner.
The penalty for delinquents was banishment and confiscation of one
third of their property.[61]

_1524,--March._ _An imperial edict_ states that, notwithstanding
the previous edicts forbidding the sale of heretical books, certain
printers are again bringing before the public reprints of these with
the excuse that they do not bear the name of Luther but are issued
under such titles as _Evangelium_ or _Summa Theologiae_. Specially
forbidden are an edition of the _Gospel of St. Matthew_ with notes
by Johann Pelt, and a treatise by the same author called _The Sum of
Godliness_.

_1526._ _An imperial edict_ orders to be confiscated and burned all
copies of writings of Luther, Pomeranus, Carolostadius, Melanchthon,
Oecolampadius, Lambertus, and Jonas, and of versions in the vernacular
of the Gospels and Epistles and all books which support the Lutheran
doctrine.

_1529._ It was ordered that, while all books required a permit from the
Crown, those dealing with matters of faith must also be approved by the
bishop. Whoever prints an heretical book is to be exposed on a scaffold
and then branded by a hot iron with the mark of the cross, or he is to
lose either an eye or a hand.[62]

_1529._ _An imperial edict_ prohibits the printing, distribution,
possession, etc., of the writings of Luther, Wyclif, Huss, Marsilius,
Oecolampadius, Zwingli, Melanchthon, Lambert, Pomeranus, Brunfels,
Jonas, and all other “sectarians”; also the Testaments as printed by de
Berghes, von Redmonde, Zell, and others, which had been condemned as
heretical by the faculty of Louvain, all books printed during the past
ten years which did not bear the name of author and name and address of
the printer, and finally all pictures tending to bring dishonour upon
the Virgin or the Saints.

_1540._ _An imperial edict_ prohibits a much longer series of books,
the list including, in addition to the Lutheran writers, histories of
Germany, and editions of certain books of Aristotle, and a number of
issues of the Scriptures. The lists in these earlier prohibitions were
evidently utilised later in the Indexes of Louvain, as some of the
misprints of names are repeated.

Reusch mentions that the city of Antwerp secured as a privilege from
the emperor an order forbidding the arrest within its walls of any
printer or bookseller. In cases in which the regulations had been
disobeyed, the delinquents were safe from arrest unless they could be
enticed outside the city.[63]

_1546._ It is ordered that the record of the permit must be printed in
each copy of the book, and before copies can be offered for sale the
printed text must be compared with that of the manuscript as approved.

_1550._ It is ordered that if a book has been printed without a permit,
but is found on examination to contain nothing pernicious, the printer
is simply condemned to banishment for life, first making payment of a
fine of 300 _caroli_. The possession or the reading of heretical books
was in itself sufficient evidence of heresy. A person found guilty of
heresy was permitted, for a first offence, to purge himself of his
sin by recantation. If the delinquent persisted in his heresy, the
penalty, under the edicts of 1529 and 1531, was for men, beheading, for
women, burial alive. Heretics who had recanted and later relapsed were
burned.[64]


=4. Regulations in France, 1521–1551, concerning the Production and
the Use of Books.=--It was the case in France as in England that the
control of the supervision of the printing-presses and of the business
of book-distribution rested from the outset with the Crown; and that
as far as regulations were framed by the theological faculty of the
Sorbonne or by the bishops, this was done under the authority and
instructions of the king. In France, however, another division of the
temporal power, namely, the Parliament of Paris, undertakes from time
to time the publication of regulations for the control of the press,
or for the prohibition of books already in print; but by the close of
the 16th century this independent action on the part of the Parliament
comes to an end; Thereafter the orders concerning books are based on
the sole authority of the king, and are, as a rule, issued by the royal
chamberlain.

_1521._ _Francis I_ issues an edict, framed at the instance of the
University of Paris, prohibiting the printing of any new works, either
in Latin or in French, having to do with matters of faith or with the
Scriptures, until the texts had been examined and approved by the
theological faculty.[65]

_1528._ _A Provincial Council, held at Sens_, acting under the
instructions of the King (Francis I), issues a decree forbidding the
possession of copies of the writings of Luther and his followers. There
is also a prohibition of the reading or the circulation of any works on
religious subjects which do not bear record of a permit from the bishop.

_1528._ _A Provincial Council at Bourges_ issues a decree which is in
its wording precisely identical with the above. It is probable that
they were both prepared in Paris.

_1530._ _The King gives_ orders for the appointment of certain
inquisitors of literature. The first group comprises two magistrates
selected from the Parliament of Paris, and two divines selected by the
College of the Sorbonne. This commission bears, in addition to the
authority of the Crown and the instructions of the Parliament (which
is, it must be borne in mind, a high court of justice), an instruction
from the Archbishop of Paris to take measures for the repression of
heretical literature. The lists of the prohibited and of the permitted
or privileged books were published under the authority of the officials
of the Parliament by the guild of printer-publishers. The scholarship
of the divines of the Sorbonne was called upon by the Parliament for
the determination of questions of heresy in doctrinal and religious
works, a course which had the natural result of bringing upon the
college an increasing measure of influence in the shaping of the
Indexes and in the control of book-production.

_1542._ _The Parliament of Paris_ issues an order prohibiting the
printing of any book without the approval of the rector of the
university and the deans, and directing the rector to appoint two
members of each faculty to conduct the examination of the books
submitted. It was added later that, for Bibles and works of religion,
the signatures of not less than four doctors of divinity were to be
required. In the same year, it was ordered that all bales of books
arriving in Paris must be opened in the presence of four of the
certified book-dealers (_libraires jurés_) and examined by the divines
appointed by the rector. The examiners were to supply to the royal
procurator a list of the books the sale of which was authorised. The
selling of any books the titles of which were not included in the list,
was forbidden under severe penalties.[66]

_1542._ _The Parliament of Paris_ issues an order to the Sorbonne to
prepare a catalogue of prohibited books. No copies of this catalogue
have been preserved, but the Paris collection contains a copy of the
supplement issued in March, 1543. This presents sixty-five titles, put
together without any order, chiefly of works by well-known German and
French reformers, printed in Latin and in French, together with a few
anonymous French books. This catalogue, while the work of scholarly
compilers, is described by Reusch as full of blunders.[67]

_1544._ _The Faculty of the Sorbonne_ issues an alphabetical catalogue
of all the books which it had thus far condemned.

_1547._ This catalogue is reprinted with a supplement of forty-seven
titles, the last Index compiled under the direction of the college.

_1548._ _The Inquisitor of Toulouse, Vidal de Becanis_, places his
“privilege” on an Index the names of the compilers of which do not
appear. The introduction denounces as heretics the persons who, during
the past three years, have read, possessed, bought, sold, bound, or
printed the books specified in the following lists; and condemns to
excommunication all who, after the publication of the Index, fail
to deliver for destruction existing copies, or who protect persons
concealing copies. The catalogue contains ninety-two titles, which are
in their wording badly confused and misprinted. A few instances are
cited by Fréville:

Martini Lutheti (for Luther); Vulpici Zironga (for Zwingli). Of
twenty-one authors, the complete works are condemned, etc. For Erasmus,
the list covers seventeen titles. The prohibition covers Latin or
French Bibles or Testaments, and the possessors of such are to be
denounced.[68]

_1551._ _Henry II_, in an edict issued at Chateaubriand and duly
recorded in Parliament, prohibits the importation of any books printed
in Geneva or in any other towns which had fallen away from the Church.
No books recorded in the prohibited lists of the Sorbonne could be
printed, sold, or owned. Only those persons were permitted to possess
copies to whom had been given canonical permission for the reading of
heretical works. The printers must record their names and their work
could be carried on only in certain specified places. Bales of books
coming in from abroad must be opened in the presence of two deputies
from the theological faculty or of two magistrates. Twice a year,
these same deputies must inspect the bookshops. In Lyons, which was
a great dépôt for imported books, the shops were inspected not less
than three times a year, the inspectors including the archbishop and
the seneschal. Every bookshop must carry in evidence a copy of the
prohibitory catalogue of the Sorbonne, and corrected lists of the books
in stock. Colporteurs (_portepanniers_) were not permitted to sell
books, their printed stock being restricted to broadsides or single
sheets.

_1551._ _The Parliament of Paris_ orders the reprinting, with
additions, of the Sorbonne Index of 1544. The compilers of this appear
to have done their work without reference to that of the editors of
the Louvain Indexes. The Paris lists were utilised both in Venice
and in Rome. In the reprint of the supplementary Index of 1547, the
introduction speaks of the united efforts of the king, the Parliament,
and the faculty of the Sorbonne to protect the realm against the
pernicious assaults of heretical literature. Reference is made to
the insidious forms in which heretical teachings are presented, in
anonymous books, in volumes bearing no name of publisher or printer, or
place of imprint, in volumes bearing, falsely, the names of orthodox
Catholic writers. A book full of heretical blasphemies had, for
example, been issued under the title of _Confessio Fidei per Natalem
Bedam_ (possibly meant for the Protestant Doctor Noel Beda). Another
“godless treatise” is called _Proverbia Salomonis_, etc.[69]

Among the authors whose works appear in these Paris Indexes may be
noted the following: Erasmus, Jo. Ferus, Polydorus Vergil (editions
of whom had been issued by Stephanus), Louis de Berquin, Estienne
Dolet (who was executed for heresy in 1556), Faber Stapulensis, Beda,
François Rabelais, a “Benedictine monk who finally became pastor at
Meudon.” One would hardly recognise under this catalogue description
the creator of Gargantua and Pantagruel, while it is not at all
surprising that the narrative of the doings of these two world’s heroes
should have been found deserving of a place on the Index. The book of
Pantagruel, which was first printed anonymously in 1533, was reprinted
in 1546 with the name of its author. It was placed on the Index of the
Sorbonne in 1553, and in the same year was condemned in the official
list of the Parliament. In 1554, however, at the instance of the
Cardinal de Châtillon, Henry II cancelled the prohibition. In the Roman
Index, Rabelais stands in the first class, but is recorded under the
term “Rabletius.”[70]

The various editions of the Scriptures brought into print by Robertus
Stephanus (Estienne), many of which included notes and commentaries
by the scholarly publisher, were all condemned by the Sorbonne as
heretical. As long, however, as Francis I lived, the condemnation was
not put into force. These Bibles also find place in the Louvain Index
of 1546, which was reprinted in Paris in 1548 under the instructions of
the Sorbonne. In 1548, the opponents of Stephanus were able to secure
from Henry II an order for the enforcement of their censorship of his
Bibles. The publisher thereupon migrated to Geneva, and was able in his
masterly retreat to carry with him across the frontier his fonts of
type and some portions at least of the editions of the Bibles and other
offending books which had been ordered to be delivered to the officials
of the Sorbonne for their burning.

_1557._ _Francis I_ arranges with the Pope, Paul IV, for the
appointment as Inquisitors-General of the Cardinals Lorraine, Bourbon,
and Châtillon, to whom was confided the supervision, under royal
authority, of the inspection of books.

_1559._ _The Parliament_ orders all those possessing doctor’s degrees
to report to the faculty of the college the titles of heretical or
suspicious books.

_1562._ _The Parliament_ again orders the college to compile an
Index, but the work was never completed.[71] Under royal edicts, the
prohibitions in the catalogues of the Sorbonne were made binding on all
citizens. A further evidence that the final authority in the matter of
censorship was retained by the State, is the order issued in 1546 by
Francis I that the Bibles of Robert Estienne were not to be included in
the Sorbonne Indexes. Another example is a notice which Espencé had
succeeded in having attached to the orders of 1547, directing that the
prohibition should not be enforced in the case of two books the titles
of which were already on the list of books condemned by the Sorbonne.
The Index of 1544 comprises five divisions: _a_, works in Latin, by
known authors, arranged alphabetically; _b_, anonymous works in Latin;
_c_, works in French by known authors; _d_, anonymous works in French;
_e_, French versions of the Scriptures. The lists include no writers
of whom all the works are condemned (Class I of the Roman Indexes).
Among the better known names may be mentioned: Erasmus, Faber, Ferus,
Peter Martyr, Wyclif, Huss, Corvinus, Osiander, etc. An introduction to
the fifth part emphasises the peril of placing in the hands of simple
and unscholarly readers versions in the vernacular of the Scriptures,
and refers to the evil results produced with such heretics as the
Waldenses, the Albigenses, and the like.

In 1562, there is record of the seizure at some French port by M. de
Bourbon of a collection of wine casks packed with books which had
been sent from Germany, and which Bourbon found to be of the “most
distressing character.” These books the lieutenant consigned to the
flames, having apparently taken the responsibility of himself acting as
censor.[72]

_1577._ _Henry III_ issues an edict modifying, in behalf of the
Protestants, the regulations of the edict of Chateaubriand. No books
are to be sold without the permit of the local magistrates, or as far
as concerns the works of the adherents of the so-called reformed
religion, without the approval of special commissioners to be appointed
by Parliament.


=5. Regulations in Spain, 1521–1551, concerning the Production and
the Use of Books.=

_1521. March 20._ _Leo X_, in a brief addressed to the High Constable,
the Admiral of Castile, and Cardinal Adrian (who constituted at the
time the government of Spain), orders that measures may be taken to
prevent the importation into the country of the pernicious writings of
Luther and his followers. The cardinal issues an order in the same year
for the confiscation and destruction of all such works.

_1522._ _Cardinal Adrian_ issues a second order, calling for the
delivery for destruction of all books by the Reformers of Germany,
under severe penalties for persons withholding or concealing copies.
Before the close of the same year, Adrian becomes pope.

_1530._ _Manrique, Archbishop of Seville_, and Inquisitor General,
confirms the ordinance of 1521, with some sharpening of the penalties
for non-obedience. He cautions the faithful that certain Lutheran books
are being circulated under false titles and that pernicious Lutheran
notes have been printed in editions of works by good Catholics.
The inquisitors are ordered to search libraries and bookshops. The
authority to give permits for the printing of books is placed in the
hands of the higher Council of the Inquisition.

_1531._ _The Inquisitor General_ authorises the inquisitors to
excommunicate persons who disregard the regulations, who possess or
read copies of such books, or who fail to denounce others.

_1541._ _The Inquisitor General_ prohibits the inquisitors from
granting permission for the possession or reading of forbidden books.
Even the Counsellors of the Inquisition (under whose advice the lists
of heretical books were prepared) are forbidden to read the same.[73]

_1543._ _Charles V_ issues an edict for the control of books, etc.,
in his American possessions. The printing, the importation, and the
reading of novels and romances is forbidden.

_1550._ _The Bull of Julius III_, recalling all outstanding permissions
for the reading of forbidden books, is published as authoritative for
Spain.

_1550._ _Charles V_ orders that the book-dealers in Seville must make
registry before a royal official of the titles of all books planned for
export to the colonies and must take oath that the schedules contain
nothing prohibited.

_1556._ _Philip II_ forbids the printing of any works about America
until a permit has been secured from the Indian Council.[74]


6. Regulations in Germany concerning Books, 1521–1555.

_1521, May 8._ _An edict of the Emperor_ (_Charles V_) forbids the
printing, selling, buying, owning, copying, or reading any of the
writings, already condemned by the pope, of “that stubborn heretic
Martin Luther,” and any further works that said Luther may produce. The
prohibition is made to cover also all other books, tracts, and pictures
which are antagonistic to the Faith of the Church and to good morality,
and all writings which are designed to bring into disrepute the pope,
or the other dignitaries of the Church, or princes, universities,
members of faculties, or other persons of repute. The penalties are
those previously ordered by the Church, the ban and the interdict.[75]
It is further ordered that thereafter no one shall print or sell books
having to do with the Bible, or with matters of faith, without a
specific permit from the bishop or from the theological faculty of the
proper university. The responsibility for the framing of this imperial
ordinance rested with Aleander[76]. This Edict of Worms secured
acceptance and enforcement only in certain portions of Germany.

_1523._ _The Imperial Diet of Nuremberg_, in place of making full
confirmation of the Edict of Worms, simply orders that no new writings
shall be printed or sold until they have been tested and approved by
trustworthy men. The printing and selling of libellous books (_libelli
famosi_) is forbidden under heavy penalties.[77]

_1530._ _The Diet of Augsburg_ receives, through Campeggio, a
brief from Pope Leo ordering strong measures to be taken for the
enforcement of the Bull and of the provisions of the Decree of Worms
against Lutheran writings. The Pope calls for imperial regulations to
secure the destruction of all copies of such books together with the
punishment of all persons concealing copies, and the rewarding of those
who give information of concealed heretical books. The Diet declines
however to do more than to renew the regulations for the examination of
books to be printed and the licensing of those that can be approved.[78]

_1549–1550._ _A Provincial Synod held at Cologne_ under the
instructions of the Archbishop, Adolphus von Schauenburg, issues an
edict for the protection more particularly of “simple and unlearned
pastors who are not competent to distinguish pernicious literature
from sound teaching,” forbidding all the faithful under penalty
of the Anathema, from reading the works of Luther, Bucer, Calvin,
Œcolampadius, Bullinger, Lambert, Melanchthon, Corvinus, Sarcerius,
Brentius, and some dozen other heretical writers. The edict promises
the publication shortly of a comprehensive catalogue of heretical and
pernicious literature, but such catalogue was never prepared. This
preliminary list may be classed as the first German Index of prohibited
books, the next in order of date being that published in 1582, in
Munich.

_1555._ _The Augsburger Pact_ provides that the penalties specified in
the papal regulations concerning books, etc., are to be enforced only
in the territories classed as Catholic.

_1570._ _The Diet of Speyer_ orders that printing offices are to be
licensed only in imperial cities, court cities, and university towns
and each printer must be duly placed under oath (_vereidet_) to uphold
the imperial regulations.[79] The Imperial Police Regulations repeat
the instructions of the Diet of Augsburg, with the modification that
nothing was to be printed contrary to the Christian religion or to the
Religious Pact of Augsburg.




                               CHAPTER V

                  PAPAL CENSORSHIP BEFORE THE INDEXES

    1. Earlier papal utterances concerning the writings
            of the Reformation                           1487–1521.

    2. The Bull _Coenae Domini_                          1364–1586.


=1. Earlier Papal Utterances Concerning the Writings of the
Reformation, 1487–1521.=

_1487._ _Papal Bull._ In 1487 was issued the first papal Bull having to
do with the productions of the printing-press. It is entitled: _Bulla
S. D. N. Innocentii contra Impressores Librorum Reprobatorum_, and was
addressed by Pope Innocent VIII to seven “governments” as follows:
Romana, Curia, Italia, Germania, Francia, Hispania, Anglia, and Scotia.
The opening paragraph reads: “And, therefore, we who hold on earth the
place of Him who came down from heaven to enlighten the minds of men
and to disperse the darkness of error,” etc.

_1516._ _Council of the Lateran._ The fifth Council of the Lateran,
assembled in Rome, in 1516, under Leo X, adopted, with but one
dissenting voice, a papal constitution which recited the injury to
faith, morals, and public peace arising from the increasing number of
books containing doctrines contrary to religion, or libellous attacks
on individuals. It was ordered that thereafter no books should be
printed without a preliminary examination and license. In Rome, the
authority rested with the papal vicar and with the master of the palace
and elsewhere with the bishop and inquisitor. The duties of censorship
were thus shared between the bishops and the Inquisition. The former,
as a rule, were engrossed with temporal cares and were negligent, and
as Lea points out, there is no trace of their discharging in Spain
the functions thus imposed on them. The inquisitors were active and
aggressive, eager to extend their jurisdiction, and they formed the
most convenient instrumentality to be utilised by the Church and the
State for curbing the licentiousness of the press.[80]

_1518, August 9._ _Hieronymus, Bishop of Ascoli_ and Auditor of
the Apostolic Chamber, who had been charged by the pope with the
investigation of the case of Luther, ordered Luther to report to Rome.
Later, the papal Legate, Cardinal Thomas de Vio (Cajetanus), was
ordered to give a hearing to Luther, with the further instruction that
if Luther were recalcitrant he was to be arrested. In case he evaded
arrest, he and his supporters were to be excommunicated, and the places
in which he secured protection were to be placed under interdict.[81]
These instructions were in the main based upon alleged heresies
contained in the treatises and propositions that Luther had, up to that
date, brought before the public, although these treatises were not
referred to by name.

_1518, Nov._ _Pope Leo_ issues a Bull addressed to Cardinal Cajetan on
the subject of absolution. In the Bull, Luther’s name is not mentioned.

_1519._ _The Theological Faculties of Cologne and Louvain_ condemn a
collection of Luther’s writings (which includes the ninety-five theses
and the sermons on absolution, etc.) and order all copies to be burned.

_1520, June 15._ _Leo_ issues the Bull _Exurge_, in which the Pope
states that, after careful consideration with cardinals and other
theologians, he pronounces to be heretical, false, and pernicious,
forty-three propositions contained in the writings of Martin
Luther;--and therefore are condemned all books, tracts, and sermons
of said Luther, and all citations from the same. It is forbidden to
print, sell, distribute, read, or possess copies or to quote them, and
all existing copies are to be burned. The penalty for disobedience is
excommunication _latae sententiae_.

_1520, July._ _Pope Leo_ in a brief to Cardinal Albert, Archbishop
of Mayence, calls attention to the pernicious and shameless writings
of Ulrich von Hutten, which were being put into print in Mayence in
the immediate neighbourhood of the bishop’s palace, and orders the
Cardinal to take strong measures for their suppression. The Archbishop
replies that he has put the printers in prison, but that he can do
nothing against the author, who is securely entrenched in his castle
with a strong body of retainers. The work chiefly complained of was the
treatise _De Unitate Ecclesiae_. This appears in the Index of Paul IV,
and in the succeeding Indexes.

_1521, Jany. 3._ _Pope Leo_ issues the Bull _Decet Romanum Pontificem_,
confirming the penalty of excommunication for Luther and his followers.

_1521.,_ _The Faculty of the Sorbonne_ publishes a similar condemnation.

_1521, April 18._ _Pope Leo_ sends a brief to Cardinal Wolsey directing
him to carry out the orders for the burning of copies of Luther’s
writings. The Cardinal had evidently delayed the promulgation of the
Bull _Exurge_. The Pope sends Wolsey a copy of Luther’s treatise on the
Babylonian captivity, with the remark that not only the book but the
author ought to be burned. Thereupon Wolsey, in his capacity as legate,
after consideration with the Archbishop of Canterbury, and with the
approval of the king, orders the destruction of all copies of Luther’s
writings to be found in England.[82]

_1520, June 12._ _Pope Leo_ orders a formal burning in Rome of the
available copies of Luther’s writings. With these was burned an effigy
of Luther himself.


=2. The Bull Coenae Domini, 1364–1586.=--The Bull of the Lord’s Supper
presents a collection of the various excommunications which had been
ordered by successive popes against certain specified classes of
persons, and also against certain individuals on the ground of heresy.
In its original wording, it dates from Urban V in 1364,[83] but the
form in use through the period of the Reformation was given by Julius
II in 1511. Less important changes were made by later popes. Julius
II specifies as under excommunication a number of heretical sects,
including the Wyclifites or Hussites. The schedule reads: _Patarenos,
Pauperes de Lugduno, Arnaldistas, Speronistas, Passagenos, Wiclifitas
seu Hussitas, Fraticellos de Opinione nuncupatos, et quoscumque alios
haereticos ac omnes fautores_.[84]

_1517._ _Leo X_ prohibits, under penalty of the _ex latae sententiae_,
the further printing of the _editio princeps_ of the first five
books of the History of Tacitus, which had been published by Philip
Beroaldus in 1516, under a Milan privilege.

The conclusions of the Casuists in regard to the effect of the
prohibitions in the _Bulla Coenae_ are summarised as follows by
Ferraris[85]: In order that the reading of a book shall bring upon the
delinquent the threatened excommunication,

1st. The book must be the production of an actual heretic (not merely
of one not baptised, or of a Catholic who through heedlessness or
ignorance has given utterance to heresy);

2d. It must contain a heresy, or must have to do with religious matters;

3d. The reader must have knowledge that the book is the work of a
heretic, and contains heresy or treats of religion;

4th. The reading must have been done without the permission of the
Apostolic Chair;

5th. The reading must be sufficient in amount to constitute a mortal
sin. This amount has naturally been variously defined, so as to cover
the entire work (Sanchez) or a single page, or two lines (Toletus). [86]

A Bull of Pius IX makes some modification in these regulations. The
excommunication (reserved as papal) comes into effect through the
reading of works which are written by heretics or apostates, or
which present or defend heresy. But this would not exclude weekly
or daily periodicals which might in some of their columns contain
pernicious matter. Books produced by writers outside of the Church are
held as less pernicious than the works of Catholics who have become
Free-Thinkers, Rationalists, or Spiritualists, and who are, therefore,
to be classed as apostates.[87]

From the middle of the 16th century, there are instances of public
protest and of action on the part of political rulers against the
promulgation of the _Bulla Coenae_ or the enforcement of its penalties.
In 1536, a commentary by the jurist Pierre Reboeuf on the Bull was
confiscated in Paris. In 1551, Charles V prohibits the printing of the
Bull in Spain. In 1568 Philip II confirms this prohibition, and asks
the pope to recall the Bull as far as Spain was concerned. In 1570, the
publication of the Bull is forbidden in Naples. In 1568, the Senate of
Venice forbids the publication; but in 1570 the Council of Ten permits
the reading of the Bull in the churches on Maundy Thursday. In 1582,
Philip II prohibits the publication in Portugal. In 1580, Henry III
prohibits the publication in France. In 1586, Rudolph II prohibits the
publication in Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia.

_1524._ _Adrian VI_ adds “and Martin Luther, and all who read, listen
to, distribute, or possess his writings, or defend the teachings in the
same.”

_1536._ _Paul III_, in a reissue of the _Bulla Coenae Domini_, adds
the words: “We excommunicate and anathematise ... all heretics, the
Kathareni, the Patareni ... who are followers of the godless and
abominable heresies of Martin Luther, condemned by Leo X, and all who
favour or protect him in any way, and all who read or distribute the
writings of said Martin.”

_1583._ _Gregory XIII_, in a Bull issued April 4th, modifies this
_Passus_ to the form which is followed in the later Bulls:

   “We excommunicate ... all Hussites, Wyclifites, Lutherans,
   Zwinglians, Calvinists, Huguenots, Anabaptists,
   (anti)-Trinitarians, and all heretics of whatever name or sect,
   and their followers (_eorum credentes_) and protectors, and
   all those who print, distribute, possess, or read the writings
   of these heretics, or any books which attempt to undermine the
   authority of the Apostolic Chair,” etc.

Since Julius II (1503) it is ordered[88] in the Bull that it shall
be formally promulgated by all bishops once each year. Gregory XIII
directs all pastors and confessors to keep copies for diligent study.
The day selected is usually the Thursday before Easter (Maundy
Thursday).

The excommunication which is made applicable to heretical writings
is, for the most part, the _excommunicatio major_. This excludes the
condemned from the Sacraments, and from the holding of office (as under
the _excommunicatio minor_), and also excludes from public worship
and from burial in consecrated ground; while it involves the loss of
legal rights. It is also, as a rule, _latae_ (instead of _ferendae_)
_sententiae_, that is, its authority goes into effect at once, as a
necessary result of the sinful action, and without the requirement of
a judgment.[89] The Jesuit Faure states that, in the earlier ages of
the Church, the _censura latae sententiae_ was ordered but seldom,
but since the 13th century, the instances of its use had very largely
increased, and (in connection with the supervision of publications) had
become almost a routine.

_1770._ _Clement XIV_ orders that the yearly publication of the Bull be
discontinued, but the Bull itself was not recalled or modified.

_1869. Oct._ _Pius IX_ issues a Bull recalling or modifying certain of
the provisions of the _Coenae Domini_.[90]

Peignot (writing in 1806) speaks of this as “an inconceivable Bull
rejected by France and by nearly all of the Catholic States and very
properly condemned to eternal oblivion.” He goes on to say that
“Rome no longer lays claim to the chimerical right of disposing
crowns and of controlling kings. It is to-day more sparing of those
invisible thunder-blasts which in times past have caused sovereigns to
tremble.”[91]

Cardinal Erskine, speaking in 1815, declares the Bull to be
“implicitly in vigour in all its extension,” and defines it as a
“public declaration to preserve the rights of the Pope.” Dr. Sleven,
the Prefect of the Dunboyne Establishment, speaking in 1826, states
that “the publication of the Bull during the coming year is something
entirely within the option of the Pope.”[92]

Count Ferdinand dal Pozzo, a Roman Catholic, writing (in Vienna) in
1825, says: “The reading of the Bull, originally ordered for every year
at Rome on Holy Thursday (Maundy Thursday), was suspended by Clement
XIV, to avoid giving offence to crowned heads.” Mendham,[93] in quoting
dal Pozzo, points out that the Bull itself (which, he says “contains a
series of the most absurd pretensions) was not revoked. Permission is
still granted to absolve in the cases reserved in this Bull.”




                              CHAPTER VI

       THE ROMAN INQUISITION AND THE CONGREGATION OF THE INDEX.


1. =The Institution of the Roman Inquisition, 1542.=--The year 1542
marks the beginning of formal regulations framed in Rome itself for
the suppression of heretical literature and for the supervision and
control of the work of the printers. The English catalogues of 1542
and later, and the edicts of Charles V, published between 1526 and
1540, while having for their expressed purpose the maintenance of
the doctrines of the Church, were issued under the authority of the
State. These earlier censorship measures do not appear even to have
been the result of any direct initiative or suggestion from Rome.
It may be remembered, indeed, that the _Bulla Coenae_ presents, in
its successive forms, a very forcible expression of the policy of
the Church in regard to the spread of heresies through literature
and of the intention of controlling the production and distribution
of books, and this Bull in its original form (as issued by Urban V
in 1364) antedates the operation of the printing-press by nearly
a century. But the formulation of the measures by which the fight
against this perilous ally of heresy was to be carried on, had to wait
for the reorganisation, in 1542, of the Roman Inquisition, which
reorganisation was the direct result of the revolt of Luther and his
associates.

In the present study, I am concerned with the Inquisition only in
so far as this was brought into direct relations with the work of
censorship. The Inquisition as an institution was not brought into
existence at any one date but had a gradual development. Lea refers to
the

   “gradual organisation of the Inquisition as being the result of
   an evolution arising from the mutual reaction of certain social
   forces. The triumph of the Church in the suppression of the
   Albigensian crusades had increased its responsibilities, while
   the imperfection of the means at its command for discharging
   these responsibilities was evidenced by the enormous spread of
   heresy during the 12th century.”[94]

The responsibility for the discovery and the control of heresy had from
the earlier years of the Church rested in the hands of the bishops. For
many years after the central authorities undertook to exercise a direct
control over heresy and heretics by means of inquisitors appointed from
Rome, the bishops continued to enforce their own jurisdiction in the
matter of the trial of heretics, sometimes apart from the inquisitors
and sometimes in conjunction with them. The spiritual courts which came
to be attached to their episcopates, and which exercised exclusive
jurisdiction over a constantly widening jurisprudence, arose gradually
during the troubles that followed the division of the Carlovingian
empire. All errors of faith and charges of heresy necessarily came
within the purview of these spiritual courts.[95] Following in the
traces of the civil law, there were in these spiritual courts
three forms of action in criminal cases: _accusatio_, _denunciato_,
and _inquisitio_. In _accusatio_ there was an accuser who formally
inscribed himself as responsible and who in case of failure was
subject to the _taglio_. _Denunciatio_ was the official act of a
public officer, such as the archdeacon, who summoned the court to take
action against the offenders coming within his official knowledge. In
_inquisitio_, the Ordinary arrested the suspected criminal, imprisoning
him if necessary. The indictment, or _capitula inquisitionis_, was
communicated to him and he was interrogated thereupon with the proviso
that nothing extraneous to the indictment could be subsequently
brought into the case to aggravate it. The verdict was finally
given by the Ordinary. The first inquisitors may be considered as
in a measure successors to the _Missi Dominici_ of Charlemagne,
officials commissioned to traverse the empire making inquisition into
all cases of disorder, crime, and injustice. We find in Verona, in
1228, “inquisitors” and “manifestors” employed by the State for the
“detection and punishment of blasphemy.”[96] Under Clement, the bishops
were ordered to make diligent visitations throughout their dioceses
investigating all offences, and with the growth of ecclesiastical
jurisdiction, this inquisitorial duty was perfected and organised. In
1227, the Council of Narbonne commanded all bishops to institute in
every parish _testes synodales_ who should investigate heresy and other
offences.

The popes had endeavoured to overcome episcopal indifference to the
matter of heresy by a somewhat irregular “Legatine Inquisition.” It
would appear, however, as if up to the beginning of the 13th century
this whole business of the discovery and the correction of heresy had
been cared for by the Church authorities in an unsystematic manner and
with no consistency of policy. The more conscientious and more forcible
rulers of the Church recognised that heresy must be exterminated at
whatever cost, but the measures for its extermination proved to be
difficult to bring into organisation. “The institution of the mendicant
orders,” says Lea, “placed at the disposal of the Church groups of
workers who possessed exceptional facilities for the task to be
undertaken. The Dominicans and the Franciscans were peculiarly devoted
to the Papacy, and the papal authority placed in their hands to carry
on in its larger development the work of the Inquisition, proved to be
a powerful instrument to extend the influence of Rome and to lessen the
independence of the local churches.”[97]

The consecutive history of the Inquisition as a definite organisation
may be said to date from the Council of Toulouse in 1229. The Spanish
Inquisition, which proved to be by far the most persistent, the most
effective, and the most terrible of the Inquisition organisations of
the world, dates from 1480. Curiously enough, the most complete and
pitiless of the acts of persecution that were based upon the Lateran
canons was the work of one of the fiercest opponents of the Church,
the Emperor Frederick II. It became necessary, on more grounds than
one, for the Emperor to meet the charges of heresy that had been freely
brought against him, and for this purpose, he found it convenient
to manifest special zeal in the persecution of heretics. The edicts
putting this persecution into form were issued between the years
1220 and 1239. In 1232, Frederick placed at the command of the papal
inquisitors the whole machinery of the State, for the purpose of
tracing heresy and of capturing and condemning heretics. Frederick’s
coronation edict against heretics, issued in 1220, was sent by Pope
Honorius to the University of Bologna to be taught as a part of
practical law. The whole series of Frederick’s edicts was subsequently
promulgated by successive popes in repeated Bulls. The substance of
these edicts was finally incorporated in the _Corpus Juris_ as
part of the canon law itself, and their regulations may, technically
speaking, be regarded as in force in the present day.[98]

The commission issued in 1227 by Gregory IX may be conveniently
accepted as constituting the foundation of the papal Inquisition.
From this date, the policy of the Church in the great work of the
suppression of heresy was pushed forward with a consistency on the
part of the central organisation that had not before been possible.
In April, 1233, Gregory IX issued two Bulls making the persecution of
heresy the special function of the Dominicans. The plan, arrived at
by Gregory, for the selection by the provincial churches of certain
brethren who exercised within their several provinces the delegated
authority of the Holy See in searching out and examining heretics, was
accepted as a permanent basis of the Inquisition. The bishops continued
from time to time to protest against the invasion by these papal
inquisitors of their territories and of their responsibilities, but the
power of the Inquisition continued to strengthen itself through the
centuries. The germ of the Inquisition lies in the duty of searching
out and correcting error. It was, therefore, natural that when the new
art of printing had largely increased the risk of the spread of error,
the Inquisition should have claimed and should have secured a large
share of the responsibility for the control of the printing-press.

The chief original authority for the system of the earlier Inquisition
is the _Directorium Inquisitorium_ of Nicholas Eymeric, who was
Inquisitor-General for Castile in 1316. Eymeric left, among other
works, the manuscript of a _Liber Sententiarum_, or Book of Judgments,
which presents the early rules of procedure. In 1252, Innocent IV
issued the Bull _Ad Extirpanda_, addressed to the potentates and
rulers of Italy, which presented an elaborate law for the establishing
of machinery for systematic persecution in every city and in every
State. In 1265, Urban IV renewed an order, originally issued in 1257
by Alexander IV, under which the local authorities were forbidden
to interfere in any way with the action of the Inquisition. The
Inquisition was made supreme in all lands and it became an accepted
maxim of law that all legislation interfering with its free action was
void and that all who enacted such laws were to be punished. When a
monarch like Philip the Fair undertook to protect his subjects against
inquisitorial processes, he risked incurring Divine vengeance. Under
the canon law, any one, from the meanest to the highest, who opposed,
or who impeded in any way, the functions of the inquisitor, or who
gave aid or counsel to others so acting, became at once, _ipso facto_,
excommunicate. In England, the statute _de haeretico comburendo_,
enacted in 1400, for the first time secured for that country the
penalty of death as a punishment for heresy. It was under this statute
that dissemination of heretical opinions by preaching or by books was
prohibited and controlled. In 1262, Urban IV instituted the office of
inquisitor-general, the first occupant of which was Cajetano Orsini,
who became Pope as Nicholas III. After the 13th century, however,
the post remained vacant. The Spanish Inquisition retained in its
organisation, from the beginning, the post of inquisitor-general,
and under such direction as that of Torquemada and of Ximenes, the
prosecution of heresy secured in Spain a consistency and finality of
action which were not to be found in any other State.

   “The papal Inquisition was an instrument of infinitely greater
   efficiency for the work in hand than any inquisitorial machinery
   controlled by the bishops. However zealous an episcopal official
   might be, his efforts were necessarily isolated, temporary, and
   spasmodic. The papal Inquisition, on the other hand, constituted
   a chain of tribunals throughout continental Europe, perpetually
   manned by those who had no other work to attend to. Not only
   therefore did persecution in their hands assume the aspect of
   belonging to the endless and inevitable operations of nature,
   which was necessary to accomplish its end and which rendered the
   heretic hopeless that time would bring relief, but by constant
   interchange of documents and mutual co-operation these tribunals
   covered Christendom with a network that rendered escape nearly
   hopeless. The Inquisition had a long arm and a sleepless memory
   and it is not difficult to understand the terror inspired by
   the secrecy of its operations and by its almost supernatural
   vigilance.”[99]

In July, 1542, under a Bull of Paul III, a new organisation was
given to the Roman Inquisition. Six cardinals were appointed
inquisitors-general, the list including Caraffa who was in 1555 to
become Pope under the name of Paul IV, and who had already taken an
active part in the fight against heresy.

The six inquisitors were empowered to take such measures as they found
necessary, with or without the co-operation of the local bishops,
for the detection and punishment of heretics, the examination of
suspected persons, the destruction of pernicious literature, and
generally for the suppression of heresy. They were also to appoint
delegates or sub-inquisitors, and to take action on appeals from all
the lower tribunals of the Inquisition. In 1558, Paul IV ordered
that the inquisitor-general or chief should always be a cardinal,
and that he should be charged with the supervision of all matters
of faith, proceedings against heretics, etc. He was to retain this
special authority during any vacancy in the Papacy. The Cardinal of
Alexandria, Ghislieri, was, however, the only one who held this sole
authority. When, in 1566, he was chosen Pope as Pius V, he appointed
four cardinals as inquisitors-general. Lea points out that the purpose
of the institution of the Inquisition was not merely the suppression
of heresy, but the reform of corruption and the correction of the
immoralities that had sprung up within the Church. Lea is speaking more
directly of the Inquisition in Spain, but the statement apparently
holds good also for the Inquisition of Rome, which charged itself later
particularly with the work of carrying out the reforms ordered by the
Council of Trent.

_1543._ _The Inquisitors-general_ issue an edict for the suppression of
heretical literature and of books written by heretics. The book-dealers
throughout Italy are forbidden, under penalty of excommunication and
of a fine of 1000 ducats, and of other punishments to be determined
in the several cases, to sell or to possess any books written by
heretics, or tainted with heresies. They are further ordered to place
in readiness for inspection all books then in stock or later received,
and thereafter to sell no books that have not been examined and
approved by inspectors appointed for the purpose. Similar instructions
are issued for the printers concerning the printing of books condemned.
The inquisitor of Ferrara and Bologna is delegated to arrange for
the inspection of printing-offices, bookshops, libraries, convents,
churches, and private houses, and to make destruction of all books
to be classed as heretical, and to report the names of all printers,
dealers, librarians, or others who refuse or evade co-operation in such
search.

_1550._ _Pope Julius III_, in a Bull issued in April, recalls and
cancels all permissions or dispensations at that time in force, for
the reading or possession of prohibited books. These permissions had
for the most part been issued to scholarly ecclesiastics whose studies
appeared to call for some knowledge of heretical literature. The Bull
repeats also the previous prohibitions, specifications of penalties,
etc., against printers, booksellers, or others, who may produce, sell,
buy, possess, or read such books. The Bull was to be read at St.
Peter’s and at the Lateran, and its provisions became binding, sixty
days later, on all persons.

The possession or the reading of forbidden books constitutes one
of the most frequent charges in the Inquisition trials of the 16th
century.[100]

The scheme for the development of the Roman Inquisition so that its
organisation should cover as with a comprehensive network the whole
of the territory that accepted the authority of the Church, was never
brought to completion. The Inquisition of Spain, the most Catholic
of the Catholic States, retained from the outset its independence
from Rome. The Spanish Inquisition, in form at least, worked under
the authority of the king, while in fact, except in the case of
strong-willed monarchs like Charles V and Philip II, it dominated
the throne as well as the country. France, in company with the other
Catholic States north of the Alps, in like manner refused to accept
as binding instructions from Rome for the direction of the operations
of the local inquisition. In France as in England, the control of
the machinery rested practically with the king, while in the several
States of Germany, the authority was for the most part exercised by
the archbishops and bishops. Even in Italy, the Roman Inquisition did
not succeed in securing a general acceptance of its authority. Venice
was able to retain, during the greater part of the centuries, liberty
of action, particularly in the control of the printing-press; Sicily
was under the control of Spain, and there were from time to time
protests and revolts in Florence and Milan.[101] The influence of the
Inquisition of Rome was, however, more extended and more important
than would be indicated by the range of acceptance of the authority
of its edicts and orders. The decisions of its courts and the policy
emphasised in its edicts were very largely followed by the inquisitors
in Spain, France, and elsewhere, and they helped to secure some measure
of consistency throughout the Catholic States in the treatment of
heresy and in the supervision of heretical literature.

_1550._ _Ghislieri, Inquisitor at Como_ (who became Pope as Pius V)
excommunicated the vicar and chapter because they had taken part with
certain book-dealers of whose stock twelve bales of books, classed as
heretical, had been confiscated. By direction of the vicar and chapter
of Como, the books had been returned to the importers. Como was at
that time being used as a port of entry for Northern Italy for books
from Germany and Switzerland. The sympathies of the town were with
the book-dealers and the Inquisition was said to have escaped with
difficulty the vengeance of the injured parties.[102]

_1563._ _Pius IV_ issues a Bull giving authority to the Inquisition to
proceed, in regard to heresy, against prelates as well as laymen. The
action of the Roman Inquisition was as a rule much less severe than
that of the Spanish organisation, and there was, therefore fierce and
effective opposition when Spanish monarchs, in connection with their
control of Italian territory, attempted from time to time to introduce
the Spanish regulations into Naples and Milan.

_1595._ _Decrees of the Roman Inquisition_ order the inquisitors, or
in their absence the bishop, to make search for heretical books in the
cargoes of all incoming ships. The books found are to be confiscated
and burned. In the Inquisition of Rome, as also in the Congregation
of the Index, the Dominicans had from the beginning exercised a very
large influence, and were in fact for the greater part of the time in
full control. From the beginning of the 16th century, this Order had
taken the leading part in the work of extirpating heresy. It was at
the instance of Cardinal Caraffa that a Dominican was associated with
the six cardinals as “Commissary” and became the actual executive of
the board. Many of the edicts and orders, and particularly those in
regard to books, soon came to be issued on the sole responsibility
of the “Commissary.”[103] In the selection of the authors to be
condemned and of the phases of doctrine to be brought into disrepute,
the old-time antagonism of the Dominicans against the Franciscans and
the Jesuits speedily became apparent. The generals of the Franciscans
emphasised with the popes the evil that was caused to the influence
of the Church by confiding to ignorant and prejudiced monks the
supervision of literature and the determination of heresies. It is not
clear, however, that the management of the Inquisition became more
judicious or the supervision of the censorship more discriminating at
the times (comparatively infrequent) when the control of the Dominicans
was replaced by that of the more scholarly, but no less bitter and
partisan, influence of the Jesuits.

The chaplain of Philip II declared it as his opinion that the
purification of Spain from heretics was due to the deaths brought about
under the regulations of the Index, and the prosecution of heretics by
the Inquisition. Cardinal Pallavicino, in his eulogy on Paul IV, lays
special emphasis on the Pope’s zealous attachment to the Inquisition,
and claims that the preservation of Italy from the infection of
invading heresies was due to the activity of the holy tribunal, and
particularly to its work in supervising the Index.[104] Paramo asserts
that the Holy Office of the Inquisition originated in Paradise and that
its record can be traced through the succeeding ages of Jewish and of
Christian history.


=2. Trials under the Inquisition in the 17th Century.=--The most
noteworthy of the trials directed by the Inquisition during the first
half of the 17th century is that of Galileo. In connection with a
denunciation that had been submitted to the authorities concerning the
teachings of Galileo, the Inquisition secured from its theological
counsellors an examination of and a formal opinion concerning two
propositions which presented the Copernican theory. One of these
was declared to be heretical, while the other was characterised as
simply erroneous. As a result of this report, given in March, 1616,
the Congregation of the Index condemned, with a _d. c._, the treatise
by Copernicus, _De revolutionibus orbium coelestium_, and also the
“Commentary on Job” by Didacus of Stunica. The latter had been issued
in Italy in 1584, and reprinted in Rome in 1592. The same list included
the prohibition of a volume by Foscarini entitled _Lettera sopra
l’opiniones de’ Pittagorici e del Copernico_, printed in Naples in
1615. A general prohibition was added of all writings which presented
similar teachings. This condemnation of the Copernican theories was,
under the instruction of the pope, communicated by Cardinal Bellarmin
to Galileo, who was at that time in Rome, and, according to the record,
the astronomer promised to correct his errors. In 1632, however, he
published a monograph entitled _Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi
del mondo Tolemaicho e Copernicano_, in which was made substantially
evident the acceptance by Galileo of the Copernican system. This
publication caused the Inquisition to institute proceedings against
Galileo and, in June, 1633, he was ordered to abjure as error and as
heresy the Copernican doctrine. The _Dialogo_ was in August, 1634,
formally condemned and prohibited. Back of these proceedings, in
1620, the Index Congregation had published a _Monitum_ in which were
specified the eliminations and corrections that had to be made in the
writings of Copernicus before any further printing of these writings
could be permitted. The changes ordered in the text caused the theories
of Copernicus to be presented not as a conclusion but as an hypothesis.
In 1619, the Congregation prohibited the _Epitome astronomiae
Copernicae_ of John Kepler. The above appear to be the only works upon
the Copernican doctrine which on that ground simply, and specifically
by title, were placed in the Index. It is the case, however, that
the _Raccolta_ of 1624, the _Elenchus_ of some years later, and the
succeeding Indexes up to the time of Benedict XIV, all contain, under
the heading of _libri_, a general prohibition covering all books which
teach the movement of the earth and the fixity of the sun. The Index of
Benedict XIV omits this general prohibition. Since that date, various
books have come into print in Rome in which the Copernican doctrine is
openly explained and maintained. It was, however, not until September,
1822, that the Inquisition gave formal permission for the printing in
Rome of books maintaining the theory of the movement of the earth about
the sun, in accordance with the accepted views of modern astronomy.
This conclusion was, on the 25th of September, 1822, confirmed by
Pius VII and in the next edition of the Index, in 1835, the names of
Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Foscarini, and Stunica were omitted. The
account of the condemnation of Galileo is given in Chapter X, in the
record of the Index of 1664.

In 1623, under Urban VIII, Mark Antonio de Dominis, formerly Archbishop
of Spalatro, was brought to trial by the Inquisition and died in the
same year while in prison. He was condemned, after his death, as a
backsliding heretic, and his body, his portrait, and his books were
burned. He had in 1616 joined the Anglican Church, but in 1622 had
returned to Rome and had abjured his heresy. The most important of
his writings that were at this time condemned was the treatise _de
Republica ecclesiastico_, which was prohibited before it had come
into print. In 1626, the English Benedictine, John Barnes, was, under
the command of Urban VIII, arrested in Paris, brought to Rome, and
condemned by the Inquisition to imprisonment for life. He died after
thirty years’ confinement, in a state of idiocy. Among the writings
of Barnes which have been placed in the Index, the most important
is the treatise entitled _Romano Catholicus pacificus_, which was
first published in England after the death of the author. In 1622,
was prohibited a treatise by Vecchietti under the title of _De anno
primitivo ab exordio mundi ad annum Julianum_, etc., the author
of which had for a long series of years been imprisoned under the
order of the Inquisition, because he refused to take back an opinion
concerning the date of the Last Supper. His theory was, however, later
adopted quite generally without further criticism. Cesari Cremonini,
a professor in Padua, was ordered more than once by the Inquisition
to report to Rome for trial. He refused obedience, however, and was
protected by the Republic of Venice. The Inquisition could take no
further action than to secure the prohibition of one of his books.
In 1644, Pallavicini was executed in Avignon under the authority
not of the Inquisition but of the papal legate. The ground for his
condemnation was a pasquil written against Urban VIII. The pasquil
itself, doubtless through oversight, escaped condemnation in the Index.


=3. The Congregation of the Index.=--In 1571, Pius V instituted
the Congregation of the Index, which was made up of certain cardinals
selected by the Pope and was charged with the work of continuing the
series of Indexes and of shaping the regulations for the prohibition
and supervision of books. The original order or edict of Pius appears
not to have been preserved. The organisation of the Congregation
was completed in 1572 by the Bull of Gregory XIII. In 1588, fifteen
congregations of cardinals were instituted by Sixtus V for various
objects. Of these, the seventh had for its function _pro Indici
librorum prohibitorum_. The Congregation is at this date (1906)
still carrying on its labours, although, under the later policy of the
Curia, its responsibilities have been somewhat restricted.

Benedict XIV, in the introduction to the _Bulla Solicita_, issued
in 1753, says:

   “There are two Congregations which have been charged by the
   Curia with the work of supervising pernicious and doubtful
   books, of reprinting those which by means of expurgation can
   be rendered suitable for preservation, and of indicating which
   must be condemned. Paul IV placed this task in the hands of
   the Congregation of the Inquisition, and still to-day (1753)
   the Inquisition gives judgment in regard to books of certain
   classes. The Congregation of the Index was, however, instituted
   by Pius V, and the responsibilities of this body were confirmed
   and extended by Gregory XIII, Sixtus V, and Clement VIII. The
   special duty of the Congregation is to make examination of
   books concerning the authorisation, the correction, or the
   prohibition of which question has arisen.”

As first constituted, the Congregation comprised four cardinals and
nine councillors. Under a Bull issued in 1572, by Gregory XIII, the
Congregation was made up of seven cardinals, of whom Sirleto was named
as chief. The Pope states as follows the grounds for the institution of
the Congregation:

   “In order to put a stop to the circulation of pernicious
   opinions, and as far as practicable to bring certainty and
   protection to the faithful, it is our desire to bring the Index
   of prohibited books into a condition of completeness, so that
   Christians may be able to know what books it is safe for them
   to read and what they must avoid, and that there may be in
   this matter no occasion for doubt or question.... Therefore we
   give to you or to the majority of your body, full authority
   and powers to take action in regard to the examination and the
   classification of books, and to secure for aid in such work
   the service of learned men, ecclesiastics and laymen, who have
   knowledge of theology and of the canons; and to permit or to
   prohibit the use of books so examined, all authority given by
   my predecessors to their bodies or individuals for the carrying
   on of the work. It shall also be the duty of your body to
   elucidate or eliminate all difficulties or incongruities in the
   existing Indexes; to arrange for the correction or expurgation
   of all texts containing instructions of value, the service of
   which is marred by erroneous and pernicious material; to add to
   the Index the titles of all works found to be unworthy; and to
   prohibit the production and the use of all books so condemned;
   and to give permission for the reading of books approved and of
   books corrected and freed from error; and for the purpose of
   facilitating your task, you shall enjoin upon all bishops ...
   doctors, masters, printers, booksellers, magistrates, and others
   to coöperate with your body in carrying out the regulations
   formulated by your body for the supervision, control, and
   improvement of literature, and for the protection of the
   faithful against heresy.”

In the Bull _Immensa_ of Sixtus V, January, 1587, the Congregation
of the Index is directed to secure co-operation from the universities
of Paris, Bologna, Salamanca, and Louvain, and other trustworthy
institutions, in the work of examining and correcting books. (The
selection of the universities recommended is interesting.) The
Congregation is empowered to give permissions, exclusively for use
in connection with the Index, to the scholars selected from these
universities, and to other scholars whose service is utilised, to read
the forbidden books without a special papal dispensation.

The _Magister_ of the papal palace (who was always a Dominican) was
the standing counsel of the Inquisition and of the Congregation of the
Index. The _Magister_ held at one time the office of papal chaplain,
and later served as the personal adviser of the pope in theological
matters. Leo X assigned to the _Magister_ (acting in conjunction with
the cardinal vicar) the control of the censorship for Rome of books to
be printed, and this function is still retained by him.[105] In 1600,
Clement VIII decides (through Cardinal Baronius) that the Congregation
has jurisdiction not only over books, but also over the authors,
printers, and readers of the same; but that it must not interfere in
the matters of heresy reserved for the control of the Inquisition.[106]

Latinus (1593, later counsellor of the Congregation) relates that
having occasion to read a volume by Paschasius, he had inadvertently
proceeded with the reading of a treatise by Bertram which was bound in
with this, forgetting that the latter was on the Index. On recognising
his error, he threw away the book, and appealed to the Cardinal of
Ermland, Grand Penitentiary, for absolution. His sin had brought him
under the “reserved excommunication.” Later, the secretary of the
Congregation had authority to give permission for the reading of
prohibited books (with a few exceptions), but for no term longer than
three years, and only in connection with an application on certificate
from a bishop, vicar-general, or general of an order.

The first _Magister_ of the palace was St. Dominic. The office was
held more than once by cardinals. Since the beginning of the 17th
century, the _Magister_ or his associate (_Socius_) is empowered, for
the city of Rome, to prohibit the printing and the reading of books.
Both officials have also the authority to permit the use of books other
than the works of authors placed in Class I, or of books which treat of
theological matters. For instance, in 1574, the _Magister_ Constabile
gave permission to the scholar, Pierre Morin, to make use of the Greek
lexicon of Stephanus (Estienne).

Doctor Shahan (of the Catholic University of America) gives me the
following statement concerning the organisation and the work of the
Congregation:

   “The Congregation of the Index has, since its formal
   organisation, always had for its Secretary a member of the
   Dominican Order. The ‘Master of the Sacred Palace’ is also,
   _ex officio_, a member of the Congregation with the title
   of Perpetual Assistant. The usage under which the office of the
   Secretary and the office of Perpetual Assistant are always held
   by Dominicans is explained as follows:

   “When St. Dominic was at Rome, he was wont to interpret the
   Holy Scriptures in the presence of the papal Court, and from
   that time one of his brethren has always continued to hold this
   office. A Dominican historian of the 18th century, Echard,[107]
   tells us that the duty placed upon this Dominican consisted
   _in Scholae Romanae et Pontificiae regimine et in publica
   Sacrae Scripturae expositione_, i. e., ‘in the government of
   the Roman and pontifical school and in the public interpretation
   of the Scripture.’ This would mean, in the 13th and 14th
   centuries, the headmastership of all theological teaching and
   preaching in the papal Curia (_Sacrum Palatium_). The
   theological sciences were not then differentiated after their
   present manner. Doctrinal theology was largely Bible-commentary.
   Thus, the Roman ecclesiastical official who had formal charge
   of Bible-study and public teaching in the papal Curia, would
   naturally be expected to control the public utterances of
   his own disciples and of others, to exercise a revision of
   theological and Scriptural manuscripts, and to detect and
   denounce current heresies, where these might be propagated
   orally or made known in writing. As a matter of fact, such
   duties belong yet to the office of the ‘Master of the Sacred
   Palace.’ It is he who selects the preachers for solemn
   pontifical occasions, and revises their sermons, and he is the
   official censor of all books printed at Rome. This office is
   the principal historical source of the Dominican influence in
   the Index. It meant from the 13th century an official duty and
   right of revision of all public ecclesiastical teaching, and
   the immediate practical decisions as to the conformity of such
   teaching with the teachings of the Scripture and of the Holy
   See.

   “There never has been in Rome a theological faculty
   corresponding in character to the theological faculties of Paris
   and of Oxford; but it would appear that the popes of the 13th
   century had hoped to be able in one way or the other to bring
   about the organisation of such an institution at Rome. There
   were always at the papal Curia theologians of distinction, both
   Italian and foreign, and the subject of ecclesiastical studies
   was naturally a matter of constant attention and concern. It
   was during this particular period of more or less unorganised
   theological activity at Rome in the 13th century that the Master
   of the Sacred Palace acquired and held all the privileges that
   then went with the office of the head schoolmaster, or head of
   the school (_Magister Scholae_). In other words, he was,
   as may be said, the equivalent of the head or rector of the
   theological faculty at Rome. I take it that had the political
   circumstances of the 14th and 15th centuries permitted the
   development at Rome of a good school of theological studies, our
   Master of the Sacred Palace would have taken on the character
   of the chancellor of the university, with such duties as are
   exercised by the chancellor at Paris and at Oxford. Probably
   too, like these officials, he would have met with prejudice and
   opposition and would have been compelled to share more generally
   the functions of his office. This was, however, the period of
   the Avignon Papacy, the Great Schism, and the preponderating
   political interests of the 15th century. So it came about
   that at the time of the Reformation, the Master of the Sacred
   Palace had for fully two centuries been an office reserved
   for a Dominican. The Order was in possession of a place quite
   closely related to its original purpose and its historical
   development. The Dominicans had also, during the first quarter
   of the 16th century, been intimately connected with the work for
   the repression of heresy. It was still the period of influence
   for the old and influential Aristotelian scholasticism and of
   this school of thought the Dominicans remained the most learned
   representatives. The Dominicans held also important theological
   chairs in many of the Catholic universities of Europe. They
   were very learned men of the severe traditional type, with a
   long record for fidelity to the Holy See, for opposition to
   heresy, and for opposition also even to the new learning that
   had led astray so many Churchmen. For these reasons, when in the
   latter quarter of the 16th century, it was the question of the
   reorganisation of the Inquisition and of the creation of the
   Index, the Dominican Order was able to put forth an indisputable
   claim for the representation of both. Possibly also the enormous
   influence of Spain at this period had something to do with the
   actual constitution of these Congregations. Spain was always
   wont to look very closely after its ecclesiastical interests at
   Rome.”

[Sidenote: The Denunciation of Books.]

The present regulations of the Index provide official channels for the
denunciation of books.

In Title I, Chapter X, it is stated that the duty of the denunciation
of books to the Congregation belongs to the papal nuncios, the
apostolic delegates, the ordinaries (Diocesan bishops), and the rectors
of the more important (Catholic) universities. It is requested that on
such occasions not only the title of the book, but the reason for its
condemnation should be given, and at the same time absolute secrecy is
promised as regards the sources of such denunciation.[108]

Mendham contends that the Italian Church seems to have acted on the
presumption that, not when she condemned and executed (whether the
innocent or the guilty), but only when she acquitted and allowed to
escape, she did wrong. And, therefore, the power of condemning supposed
heretical books was permitted to any of the superior ecclesiastical
authorities.

The pope, as head of the Church, claimed the individual right to the
control of literary production. A similar authority was likewise
allowed to, and exercised by, public ecclesiastical bodies, such as the
theological faculties of the Sorbonne and of Louvain, by individual
superior ecclesiastics, and even by the supreme civil magistrate.
There were from time to time protests, on the part more particularly
of the Jesuits and the Dominicans, against the exercise of censorship
by any bodies or individuals not explicitly authorised by the head
of the Church, or carrying some such general authorisation as that
held by the Inquisition. The Jesuit Raynaud[109] denies the authority
of the bishops; and his opinion of the censorship authority of the
universities is contemptuous. If, he argues, this power resides not in
an individual doctor as such, how can it reside in a collective body of
doctors? If Aesop’s ass, though in a lion’s skin, was still but an ass,
would a whole herd of such animals form an assembly of lions?

Van Espen, in a tract concerning the Congregation of the Inquisition,
states that the censure or condemnation of the books in the Index is
often to be resolved into the examination and judgment of a single
consultor, as he is called. Not a few true Romanists whose works were
thus transfixed have protested against the injustice of being, on the
judgment of a single examiner, classified as heretics.[110]

[Sidenote: Damages under Censorship]

I have not been able to find that the ecclesiastical authorities now
take, or ever have taken, any official notice of the damages brought
upon a publisher or a printer as a result of the condemnation of books
brought into print by him. I may assume that an Italian or a Spanish
publisher who had reason to suspect the denunciation of a work in which
he was interested, would see to it that the author either himself bore
the entire risk and expense for the production and publication of the
book, or that the author placed himself under bond of some kind for the
protection and possible reimbursement of his publisher.




                              CHAPTER VII

                THE FIRST SERIES OF INDEXES, 1510–1559

   1. Louvain, 1510 (doubtful). 2. Paris, 1544. 3. Venice, 1543.
   4. Louvain, 1546. 5. Louvain, 1550. 6. Lucca, 1545. 7. Venice,
   1549. 8. Florence, 1552. 9. Valentia, 1551. 10. Valladolid,
   1554. 11. Venice, 1554. 12. Louvain, 1558. 13. Valladolid, 1559.
   14. Rome, 1559.


_1._ _1510._ _Louvain._ Panzer makes reference[111] to a catalogue of
prohibited books printed in Louvain in the year 1510. The title cited
is, _Die Catalogen oft Inventaryen van den Quaden Verboden Bouken;
na advis dar Universiteyt van Louen. Met een Edict oft Mandement der
Keyserlycker Majesteyt. Te Louen, deprint bej Servaer van Sassen.
MCCCCCX._ This catalogue, no copy of which is at this time known to be
in existence, is also referred to by Gesner. The heresies which at that
time were to be controlled had not as yet been very clearly classified.
Martin Luther, in a letter written February 8, 1516, says: _Nec cessant
universitates bonos libros cremare et damnare, rursum malos dictare,
immo somniare_.[112]

_2._ _1544._ _Paris._ The first schedule of prohibited books printed
under the name of an Index was, as far as is at present known, that
issued by the University of Paris, in 1544. The faculty of the Sorbonne
had been instructed, under an order of the Parliament of July, 1542,
to prepare a list of the books that the college had thus far condemned.
No copy of the original list has been preserved, but a supplementary
list is in existence, bringing the record down to 1543. This supplement
contains sixty-five titles, printed without any order or arrangement,
and presenting the names of the leading German and French Reformers.
There is also a list of anonymous French works. In 1544, the college
printed an alphabeted list with about 170 titles. This was reprinted,
with additions, in 1547, in 1551, and in 1556. This is the last Index
published by the Sorbonne.[113]

_3._ _1543._ _Venice._ _Index Generalis Scriptorum Interdictorum._ This
Index is cited by Reimann in his _Catalogus Bibliothecae Theologicae_.
The entry of title is connected with the following specification:
_Atque ab hoc tempore conquievit haec libros excommunicandi ratio usque
ad A. D. 1543, quo primus Scriptorum interdictorum Index Generalis
prodiit Venetiis, quem plures postea secuti sunt_. The previous
reference had been to the decree of Gelasius of 493. Mendham is
inclined to doubt the existence of this Venetian Index, and it is not
cited by Reusch.

_4._ _1546._ _Louvain._ Compiled by the theological faculty of the
University of Louvain, under the instructions of the Emperor (Charles
V) and under the authority of the Bull issued April 13, 1536 (_Bulla
Coenae Domini_) by Paul III. Title-pages in Flemish. Lists of books in
Latin repeated in Dutch. An edition was also printed in which the lists
are given in Flemish.[114]

_The authority of the Index was emphasised by an imperial mandate,
printed in Flemish, Spanish, and French, and ordered to be connected
with the catalogue. _Mandement de l’Impériale Majesté donné et publié
en l’an MDXLVI Avecq Catalogue. Intitulation ou déclaration des livres
reprouvés, faiete par Messieurs les Docteurs en Sacrée Théologie de
l’université de Louvain, a l’ordonnance et commandement de la susdicte
Maiesté Impériale. Imprimé à Louvain par Servais de Sassia. MDXLVI cum
gratia et privilegio._

This Index of Louvain is distinctive in being the first of the long
series of catalogues of books and of authors condemned as heretical
which were issued with the sanction of the Church. It antedates by
thirteen years the first of the Indexes produced in Rome, under the
immediate supervision of the pope, and may possibly be considered
as an example of the special zeal against heresy on the part of
the ecclesiastical authorities of the Spanish realm and of the
effectiveness of the Spanish Inquisition. As the later records give
evidence, it was only in the territory in which the authority of the
Inquisition remained unquestioned and by means of its machinery that
it proved practicable to carry out with any thoroughness the policy
of the Church in regard to the ecclesiastical control of literary
productions. The faith of the believing subjects of the Emperor Charles
was threatened most seriously by heretical writings coming from
Holland and from Germany, and it was therefore quite fitting that the
first official protest of the Church should be made from a place like
Louvain, the university of which stood like a picket-post of orthodoxy
confronting the perilous heresies advancing from the North and from
the East. The name of the Inquisition is not directly connected with
this first Index of Louvain, but it appears on that printed at the
same place four years later, which is in substance a reissue of the
catalogue of 1546, and it is probably the case that the command of the
Emperor for the preparation of the earlier publication may be credited
to the Senate of the Inquisition.

The _Mandement_ makes reference to _Ordonnances_ for the restraint
of the press, issued in 1540 and 1544. It complains of the continued
publication of heretical books, and particularly of corrupt editions
of the Scriptures; and it accordingly subjects booksellers to new
restrictions, under penalty of death if they sell any books containing
error, without the previous inspection and mark of the appointed
inspectors. No books could be printed except by a duly certified
printer who was a member of the guild. The Index itself comprises, 1,
a list of Bibles and New Testaments in Latin, low German, and French
editions; 2, a list of works in Latin, chiefly the writings of the
German Reformers (these titles are repeated in Flemish); 3, a list of
heretical works in German and French; and, 4, a list of books which had
been condemned in the rescript of 1540.

The introduction by the theological faculty states that the Emperor has
charged the faculty with the duty of examining all the libraries and
bookshops, and of taking out from these the books classed as heretical,
together with those which bordered upon heresy, and also all writings
which might prove dangerous for the unlearned. A separate class was
to be made of the books which, while not condemned as heretical, were
not to be left available for the use of the general public or of young
people. The writers of the introduction admit that their lists might
be more comprehensive. They point out, however, that the compilers had
undertaken to condemn only those books which they had themselves had an
opportunity of examining. They add a remark, which might to advantage
have received further consideration on the part of the producers of
later Indexes, to the effect that it was wiser to ignore books of a
certain character rather than, in calling attention to them, to incite
curiosity and risk bringing them into influence. The writers point out
that the devout reader is in a position to judge, through the titles
presented, as to the class of literature that he is instructed to avoid.

The list of titles is arranged alphabetically, but the arrangement
confuses together the surnames and the forenames of the authors and
the titles of the books. A list is given of authors all of whose
writings are prohibited. In certain instances, as with the names of
Bucer, Bullinger, and Brenz, certain titles are specified and are
followed by a general word to the effect that “as these authors are now
known as notorious heretics, all of their writings are prohibited.”

This first Index of the series makes a precedent, which was followed
but very seldom in the later Indexes, in adding a list of works the use
of which was commended and which were permitted for the schools.

_5._ _1550._ _Louvain._ Index, prohibitory and permissive. Compiled,
under the instructions of the emperor and by authority of the Senate of
the Inquisition, by the University of Louvain. Title-pages and text in
Flemish.

_1550._ _Louvain._ The same, with Latin text. S. Sassenus.

The list of books condemned is closed with the words: _solam fidem
sufficere ad salutem_. The condemned Bibles and New Testaments, in
editions printed in various languages, aggregate forty-eight titles.

The introduction, addressed to “Christian readers,” is written over
the signatures of the rector and the members of the general faculty of
the university. The writers point out that the lists of prohibited
books include not only such as are to be classed as heretical or
as very suspicious, but also others which, under the cover of
religious instruction, are likely to mislead the unlearned or to
convey erroneous views concerning the pope, the ceremonials of the
Church, confession, mass, and the saints. Of the chief heretics, all
the writings are prohibited, the names being in the main those that
appear in the catalogue of 1540. The list includes Brunfels, Brenz,
Bucer, Bullinger, Corvinus, Calvin, Petrus Martyr, Urbanus Regius, and
Musculus. The names of Luther and Melanchthon are not included. The
suggestion is made to students whose work would be hampered through
the want of certain scholarly treatises, important in themselves and
marred possibly only through a small proportion of heretical error,
and in the case of texts from the Latin, Greek, Hebrew, or Chaldean,
the annotations to which may contain error, that permission can be
secured, by properly accredited applicants, from commissioners to be
appointed for the purpose, for a restricted use of such volumes; or the
commissioners will, at their discretion, eliminate from the volumes the
heretical or dangerous portions, thus rendering them available for use
in the class-room.

This Louvain Index of 1550 was, in 1551, reprinted in Spain under the
direction of Valdes, Inquisitor-General. Its lists (in the Latin text)
were included in the Valdes Index of 1559, and in a number of other
of the Indexes produced in Spain. The Latin lists were also utilised
in the first of the Venetian Indexes and from this the titles were
transferred to the Roman Index of 1559. The work of the theologians of
Louvain was in fact accepted as the foundation or general model for
the whole series of Indexes which were produced prior to the Council of
Trent, and was indeed, through the Index of Paul IV, utilised by the
compilers of the Tridentine Index of 1564.

The Roman compilers, in including in their schedules the titles from
the Louvain volume, transferred to Class I (comprising authors of
acknowledged heresy, all of whose works were condemned) the names of a
number of writers of whose productions the Louvain doctors had found
but a few examples deserving of condemnation. These general heretics of
Class I belong, with but one or two exceptions, to Germany and the Low
Countries. From the heretical writers of France are selected Dolet and
Marot, and from Italy, Ochinus and Curio.

_6._ _1545._ _The Senate of Lucca._ The earliest catalogue issued in
Italy of books condemned as heretical, which is entitled to be classed
as an Index, was published in Lucca in 1545. This was seventy-one
years after the introduction of printing into Italy, and fourteen
years earlier than the first papal Index. The catalogue is published
under the authority not of the bishop but of the Senate or Council of
Magistrates, but the initiative probably came from the Inquisition. The
edict orders that all copies of the books specified in the lists are,
within fourteen days, to be delivered for burning, to the confessors or
to the vicar of the bishop, under penalty of confiscation of property.

_1549._ A supplementary edict of the Senate includes among the works
condemned all anonymous works treating of religion or the Scriptures
that have not secured the approval of the vicar. The catalogue, which
is printed in Latin, presents the names of twenty-eight writers all of
whose works are condemned, the list including Wyclif, Huss, Zwingli,
Oecolampadius, Melanchthon, Carlstadt, Hütten, Hessius, Bomelius, and
other less well-known names. Calvin does not appear. There are in
addition the titles of about one hundred other pernicious books. A
brief of Pius IV, issued in 1562, commends the Senate of Lucca for its
“pious and praiseworthy decree.”

Paul V takes a different position. Under an order issued by him in
1605 the Lucca decree is annulled on the ground that the repression
of heresy is a matter that belongs exclusively to the Church, and
concerning which laymen have no authority to take action. At the same
time, he orders the institution in Lucca of an Inquisition tribunal.

_7._ _1549._ _Venice._ _Il catalogo de’ Libri li quali nuovamente nel
mesi di maggio nell anno presente MDXLVIIII, sono stati condannati et
scommunicati per heretici, da Giovan della Casa, legato di Venetia et
d’Alcani frati. E aggiunto sopra il medesimo catalogo un judicis et
discorso del Vergerio, 1549._ (In dating this Index 1549 instead of
1548 as stated by Reusch, I take the authority of Mendham, who cites
the _catalogus Bibliothecae Banavianae_.) This Index is known by the
name of Casa. No copies of the original have been found, and the
references to it are based upon the reprint issued by Vergerio in 1550.
John della Casa was the Archbishop of Benvenuto, and papal Nuncio at
Venice. His Index was, according to Vergerio, prepared by the command
of Pope Paul III. It must in that case take rank as the first Index
issued under direct papal authority. The lists are preceded by the
statement that: “All works produced by the heretics and heresiarchs
whose names follow, which have to do with theology or kindred subjects,
are condemned and prohibited.” The names of authors include Luther,
Huss, Marsilius of Padua, and Nicholas Clemangis. The catalogue
presents 142 titles--of which twenty-five are those of books issued (in
Latin) anonymously. There is also a general prohibition of “Bibles and
New Testaments containing notes or comments opposed to the faith, and
of all works which within the preceding twenty-four years have been
printed without the name of the author and address of the printer.”
Vergerio is able to point out that this Index is a very clumsy
compilation which contains a full measure of errors and which compares
unfavourably with the catalogues recently issued in Louvain and in
Paris. In certain instances, the names of the authors or of their books
are so carelessly worded as to render identification difficult. The
titles of a number of the Latin books are given in Italian, and those
of some of the few Italian books in Latin. There does not appear to
be any arrangement of the titles, alphabetical or other. Of certain
authors, as, for instance, of Giusto Giona, all the writings are
condemned, and later are given for separate condemnation the titles
of selected books of the same author. Casa speaks of having secured
the assistance of some of the most learned of the Italian theologians,
but their work appears to have been most carelessly done, particularly
in view of the fact that they had available for use the comparatively
accurate lists of the Louvain Catalogue of 1546.

Vergerio wrote (in Italian) an analysis pointing out the ignorance, and
occasional impiety, of which this catalogue gave evidence. He speaks
of it as “the first monster of the kind which had appeared in Italy,”
a statement which ignores an edition said to have been printed in
Venice in 1543.[115] In 1552, the catalogue was reprinted in Florence
with some additional titles and with correction of certain of the
errors previously pointed out by Vergerio. Concerning this catalogue,
also, Vergerio printed a criticism as a result of which a third edition
with further revisions was published in 1554, in Milan. In the same
year, a fourth edition was issued in Venice, the many blunders in
which (Vergerio uses the terms “folly” and “madness” of the compilers)
provoked the commentator to a new exposure which was printed in Latin.
Vergerio points out the omission from the lists of obscene books and of
books of magic, etc. In the former class ought, as he claims, to have
been included a work by Casa himself, _Capitolo del Forno_.

This Index of Casa has importance, notwithstanding its slightness and
bad workmanship, as well because the responsibility for its production
rested with Paul III, as because its lists, imperfect as they were, are
in part reproduced, errors included, in the Index of Paul IV.

It would have been impossible to present any account of the work
of these earlier Italian Index-makers except for the scholarly and
critical labours of Vergerio, who charged himself with the duty of
recording and of characterising these first efforts of the Church to
supervise the literature of the time and to control the output of the
printing-presses.

Peter Paul Vergerio had been papal Nuncio to Germany in 1530, and
Bishop of Capo d’Istria in 1536. He became, in 1544, a convert to
Protestantism, and in 1553 was a preacher in Tübingen, where the
greater part of his later literary work was done. His collected works
were printed in Tübingen in 1563.

What is possibly the first recorded list of heresiarchs is given in
a catalogue compiled under the instructions of the Archbishop of
Benevento and printed in Venice in the year 1549. It is printed under
the title of _Il catalogo de’ Libri, li quali nuovamente nel mese
di maggio ... sono stati condannati et scommunicati per heretici_.
The catalogue is known through the reissue by Vergerio, printed at
Strasburg in 1553.

_8._ _1552._ _The Inquisition of Florence_ issues an _Index
Prohibitorius_ which, like that of Casa, is known to us only through
Vergerio. It contained the titles collected by Casa, with a few
additions, and with certain corrections based upon the strictures made
by Vergerio on Casa’s lists.

_9._ _1554._ _The Archbishop of Milan, Giovanni Angelo Arcimboldi_,
publishes an Index, preserved only through the reprint in a
controversial pamphlet of Vergerio. The title reads: _Catalogo del
Arcimboldo Arcinescovo di Milano, one egli condanna et di ffama per
heretici la magior parte de figliuoli de Dio, et mebri di Christo,
quali ne loro, scritti cercano la reformatione della chiesa Christiana.
Con una riposta fattagli in nome d’ una parte di quei ualenti nomini.
Nello anno MDLIII._ The Index bears, in addition to the name of the
Archbishop, that of Castiglione, Commissary General of the Inquisition
for Lombardy, and the announcement that it is issued “with the approval
of the Senate of Milan.”

Under the responsibility of these three authorities, is issued, in a
preamble to the catalogue, an edict, with the following regulations:
Ecclesiastics and laymen alike are prohibited, under penalty of
excommunication and of bodily punishment, from preaching or reading
(aloud?) the Scriptures, either in church or elsewhere, without a
written permit from the archbishop. The printing, selling, possessing,
reading, etc. of books classed as heretical is prohibited. The penalty
is for each offence, excommunication, and a fine of one hundred
scudi. The fine is to be divided equally between the informer, the
Inquisition, and the imperial representative. Persons concealing
books, or withholding information, incur the same penalties. Printers,
binders, and booksellers must, within a term of two months, deliver
to the authorities a sworn schedule of the books handled by them,
with supplementary lists from month to month, and the sale, or the
possession of, any book not specified in such schedules brings upon the
dealer excommunication and a fine of ten scudi for each book. Dealers
who deliver up within ten days after receipt copies of prohibited or
of heretical books are freed from the penalties. Any person having
knowledge of the presence in the diocese of Milan of a heretic or of
one suspected of heresy, and failing to give information within thirty
days, falls under excommunication plus a fine of fifty scudi. The same
penalty comes to one who renders assistance to a Lutheran or other
heretic. A Lutheran or other heretic who recants and who denounces a
fellow heretic receives one fourth of the penalty.

The Index contains nearly five hundred titles, arranged alphabetically,
the names of the authors and those of the books being listed together.
It is therefore much more considerable than that of Casa. The list
of authors all of whose works (present and future) are condemned
(corresponding to Class I of the Roman Indexes) is proportionately
large.

_10._ _1551._ _Valentia, Valladolid, and Toledo._ _Emperor Charles
V and Archbishop Valdes.--Index prohibitory._ Compiled under
the supervision of Fernando Valdes, Archbishop of Seville and
Inquisitor-General. The Emperor Charles sent to Valdes the Louvain
Index of 1550 with instructions to have the same published in Spain.
The Spanish issue includes as a supplement a list of the books which
up to that date had been prohibited in Spain. The title reads:
_Catalogi librorum reprobatorum, et praelegendorum ex judicio Academiae
Louaniensis. Cum edicto Caesarae maiestatis evulgate. Valentiae,
typis Joannis Mey Flandri MDLI, mandato Dominorum de consilio sanctae
generalis Inquisitionis._ (Portions of the edition bear the imprints of
Valladolid and Toledo).

The first list in the volume bears the title: _Catalogus librorum
jampridem per sanctum officium Inquisitionis reprobatorum_. This is
followed by the Latin lists of the Louvain Index, with the anonymous
works alphabeted in, and a supplement with eleven further titles.
This Valdes Index is the first of the Spanish series, and forms the
foundation of the Index of 1559.

Llorente mentions[116] an Index prepared in 1555 under the instructions
of the Inquisition, but states that this was kept in the form of
manuscript for the use only of the inquisitors. Valdes was concerned
with the compilation of two further Indexes, those of 1554 and 1559.

The supplement to the lists of 1551 presents certain general
prohibitions; such as of Bibles in Spanish or in any vernacular
versions; (these are entered curiously under the letter “N,” “New
and Old Testaments”); pictures, figures or statues by means of which
the Virgin or the Saints might be brought into ridicule; all books
tainted with heresy (_sapiento haeresim_); works having to do with
necromancy; books (whatsoever their text) which had been printed
within twenty-five years, and which failed to present the name and
address of the printer. A separate prohibition is provided for books
written against the proceedings of the Diet of Ratisbon (1541). This
is directed against a monograph by Calvin, published anonymously,
in which this Diet is sharply handled. The lists report the authors
given in the Louvain Index, in some instances with fresh errors
(“Bronzins” for “Brentius”). The new names include Michael Servetus
(his first appearance in any Index), connected with his tract on
the Trinity; Simon Essius, for Simon Hessus, connected with his
_Apologia_; John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester (possibly the earliest
English author prohibited outside of England); Ulrich von Hutten,
_libri omnes_ (Hutten, while not listed in Louvain, had been recorded
by Casa); Alcoranus _vel alii libri in arabigo ubi sunt errores sectae
Mahometicae_ (this is the first appearance in an Index of Arabic
heresy). As late as 1790, the _Koran_, in every version, finds place in
the Spanish Index, while there is a special prohibition of the Latin
translation of the same that had been made in the 12th century by
Peter of Cluny, and had been printed, _cum refutationibus variorum_,
in Basel in 1543. In the Index of Quiroga, the _Koran_ appears under
the title _Machumetis ... ejusque successorum vitae ac doctrina ipseque
Alcoran ... adjunctae sunt confutationes multorum una cum M. Lutheri
praemonitione_, etc.

Reusch points out that this prohibition has to do not with the
doctrines of the _Koran_ but with the godless (_impia_) undertakings
of the publisher, Theodor Bibliander of Basel. In the Index of Clement
VIII, the entry appears, _Instructionum et rituum sectae Mahometanae
libri omnes_. Since Benedict XIV, the prohibition comes under the
general decree I, 11.

The antagonism on the part of the Protestant authorities of Basel to
the circulation of the _Koran_ appears to have been more decided than
that of the Inquisition. In 1536, the magistrates refused permission to
Heinrich Petri to print an edition; and, in 1542, an edition printed
by Oporinus was confiscated. The publisher appealed to the scholars,
and the question of permitting the publication was discussed from
the pulpits. On the receipt of an opinion from Luther in favour of
Oporinus, the books were released on condition that when published they
should not bear the imprint of Basel and that copies should not be sold
within the city.

This Valdes Index contains but four Spanish titles, the writings of
Enzinas and of Urrea, an anonymous _Dialogue of Christian Doctrine_,
and a Spanish version, printed in Geneva, of Calvin’s _Catechism_. This
last title does not appear in later lists.

_11._ _1554._ _Valladolid._ _Senate of the Inquisition.--Index
expurgatorius. Censura generalis contra errores quibus recentes
haeretici sacram scripturam asperserunt. Edita a supremo Senatu
Inquisitionis, constituto adversus haereticam pravitatem, et apostasiam
in Hispania, et aliis regnis, et dominis Caesareae majestatis
subjectis. Pinciae, ex officina Francis Ferdinan. Corduben. cum
privilegio Imperiali. 1554._

The text is known through the reprint by Ziletus in Venice, in 1562.

The lists in this Index are devoted exclusively to Bibles, of which 103
editions are specified. Many of these find place in Louvain, 1550, and
in Valdes, 1554, among the books entirely prohibited. Here, however,
these Bibles are presented as open to censure on the ground of certain
errors and heresies contained in the notes and introductions, which
notes, etc., are ordered to be cancelled or expunged. Copies thus
corrected (by cancellations) are permitted to be left in the hands of
their owners. This Index of Valdes is the first example of an _Index
expurgatorius_. A number of such expurgatory Indexes were produced
later under the authority of the Spanish Inquisition, but outside of
Spain, the attempts to control literature through the expurgation of
books already printed were but few. The futility of such attempts came
to be recognised at an early date.

The editorial responsibility for this Index of 1554 rested with the
Dominican, Alfonso Martinez, who was also the author of the _censura
generalis_. The editor had the co-operation of the theological faculty
of Alcala. The possessors of copies of the works specified are directed
to deliver these within sixty days to the bishop of the diocese or
to the local inquisitors. These officials are to take measures to
cancel (_obliterare_) the offending notes, etc., so that they can no
longer be read. The penalty for retaining uncorrected copies beyond
the period of sixty days is _excommunicatio major latae sententiae_.
The books themselves are to be destroyed, and their delinquent owners
are to pay (apparently for each offence) a fine of thirty ducats. A
similar punishment comes upon the bookseller who imports copies of
these condemned editions. The publishing centres at that time actively
engaged in the production of editions of the Scriptures are indicated
by the imprints represented in the lists of this Index as follows:
Antwerp, 14; Basel, 3; Lyons, 35; Paris, 11 (including 4 from Robert
Estienne); Zurich, 1 (Froschover); Venice, 3. Two examples may be cited
to illustrate the principles and the method of the censure.

Deuteronomy v, 9. _Solus Deus adorandus._

_Haec propositio, excludens adorationem sanctorum, est erronea._

Deut. xv, 11. _Alendi pauperes nec permittendi ut mendicant._

_Et ibidem. Prohibetur mendicitas._

_Hae et similes propositiones injuriosae sunt et malitiose annotatae
in odium religiosorum mendicantium._

Special condemnation is placed upon the Bibles printed by Estienne
(Stephanus) as edited by Vatablus. The New Testament division is to
be cancelled altogether, the errors being too many to expunge. The
Old Testament can be retained with the cancellation of the notes
(_scholia_).

_12._ _1554._ _Venice._ _The Inquisition._ A few months after the
publication of the Index of Milan, an Index was issued in Venice under
the authority of the Venetian Inquisition. The papal Nuncio, Filippo
Archinto (who succeeded Arcimboldi as Archbishop of Milan), shared with
the inquisitors the responsibility for the preparation of the lists. Of
the original issue no copy is known to exist. The description given by
Reusch is based on the reprint published by the persistent Vergerio.
The Index is accompanied by no decree. The catalogue bears as a heading
the words: _Nomina eorum qui male de fide scripserunt quorum scripta
a catholicis legi prohibentur_. The lists comprise a reprint of the
titles of the Milan Index with the addition of some seventy entries. An
appendix gives the decree of Gelasius (492) together with a few of the
book prohibitions of the Middle Ages taken from Eymeric. This Venetian
Index was utilised as the basis of the lists compiled for the Index of
Paul IV.

The Venetian and Milan compilers themselves made use of the material
collected by the Louvain compilers of 1550, and of the titles in
the Casa Index of 1549. They had also taken from the catalogue of
Lutzenburg and from the _Bibliotheca_ of Gesner the names of a number
of the heretics of the Middle Ages. Further names were secured,
curiously enough, from the letters of Oecolampadius and Zwingli, and
these last were cited so heedlessly that they include those of a number
of persons who were not, in any respect, authors.[117] Reusch points
out that in the endeavour, without adequate knowledge, to make their
lists comprehensive, the compilers had been led to include a number of
unimportant persons some of whom had published nothing religious or
theological, while others were, as said, not authors at all. In some
instances, large sounding entries cover simply the Latin rendering of
the titles of insignificant German tracts (_flügschriften_).

The Venetian Index was reprinted (from Vergerio’s reprint) in
London, 1840, by Joseph Mendham, in connection with a reprint of
the Index of Gregory XXI of 1835. Mendham uses as a general title,
_The Literary Policy of the Church of Rome_. The compilers of this
Index, like those of Milan, have included the names of a number of
persons classed as heretics in the earlier Middle Ages and before the
invention of printing, some of whom had never written anything, while
of others no writings had been preserved. To this class belong the
Wycliffite Richard “Anglicus,” the Hussite, Mathias Boemus, Desiderius
Longobardus, Joh. de Poliaco, Petrus de Aragonia, Joh. de Stuma, and
Petrus de Luna. These names are taken from Lutzenburg. Of the series
of names taken from the Louvain Index of 1550, a number are so altered
(either by scribes or by printers) as to be identified with difficulty.
From the Index of 1546 are taken Petrus Lignius, and the _Facetiae_
of Poggio and of Bebel. From Gesner are taken thirty writers some
of whom are responsible for no books at all either in theology or
religion.[118] The list includes Maturin Cordier, the instructor of
Calvin, who appears for the first time in the Venetian Index. Other
names and titles to be noted are Dante, for the _De Monarchia_ (which
was printed for the first time in 1559, in Germany, and first in Italy
in 1658), Laurentius Valla, Hubmeyer (whose name was secured from a
letter of Zwingli), Botzheim (friend of Erasmus), _Dialogi Obscurorum
Virorum_, Eckstein, and Murnarus for his _Leviathan_.

The appendix contains a prohibition, taken from Eymeric, of all works
on the subjects of geomancy, necromancy, and pyromancy.

_13._ _1558._ _Louvain._ In December, 1557, an _ordonnance_ of King
Philip II directed the preparation by the theological faculty of
Louvain of a revised and enlarged issue of the Index of 1550. This was
printed, in Flemish and in French, in 1558. The preface, signed by the
Rector of the University, states:

“It is well known to all that, since 1550, avowed heretics and others
whose catholicity is not to be trusted, have brought secretly into the
land pernicious and dangerous books, through the influence of which
the heretics are confirmed in their errors and the faithful are led
astray. It is the purpose of the present work to secure the destruction
of the existing copies of this baneful literature and to protect
the land against the introduction of further similar books. _Le
Catalogue des livres reprouvéz et des livres que l’on pourra lire aux
enfans és escholles particulières, selon le jugement de l’université de
Louvain. Imprimé par ordonnance de la Majesté Royale. Á Louvain. Par
Martin Verhassett. Imprimeur juré. L’an de grace MDLVIII. Avec Grace et
Privilège du Roy._

(Then follows a second title-page in Flemish.)

The lists contain, with some corrections, the titles printed in 1550.
The additions (distributed alphabetically) comprise about one hundred
titles. The bibliography is much more correct, in the matter of names,
book-titles, freedom from duplicate entries, and consistency of
arrangement, than that of the Italian lists of the same period. Among
the new names in Class I (authors all of whose works are condemned) are
those of Jo. Athanisius Veluanus, Jo. Sleidanus, and Memno Symonis. The
first should read: Jo. Anastasius (Jan Geeraerds ter Stege), Veluanus
(Pastor in Veluve). There are twelve additional titles in the list of
anonymous works.

The material of this Louvain Index was undoubtedly utilised by the
compilers of the Index of Paul IV, but they managed to bring into their
transcripts a number of errors that did not find place in the original.

_14._ _1559._ _Valladolid._ _Valdes._--_Catalogus Librorum qui
prohibentur mandato Illustrissimi et Reverend. D. D. Ferdinand de
Valdes, Hispalen., Archiepi., Inquisitoris Generalis Hispaniae. Nec
non et Supremi Sanctae ac Generalis Inquisitionis Senatus. Hoc Anno
MDLIX editus. Quorum jussu et licentia Sebastianus Martinez, Excudebat
Pinciae._ The industrious Inquisitor-General had already, as we have
seen, brought into print two Indexes; for the first of these he had
utilised the lists of the Louvain compilers, while the titles in the
second were restricted to editions of the Scriptures.

This Index of 1559 is the first Spanish publication in which the
lists represent original work on the part of the Spanish editors in
the selection of literature to be condemned. The brief of Paul IV,
printed in the Valdes Index, which bears date January 4, 1559, gives an
indication of the independent character of the actions of the Spanish
Inquisition. Paul states that the Inquisitor-General had informed
him that the measures taken by the Inquisition against heretical and
suspicious books had been hampered because of the licenses that had
been accorded by the Curia, not only to divines but to many laymen, for
the reading of such books. The Pope had, however (under his brief of
December 21, 1558), recently recalled and cancelled all such licenses.
He therefore charges Valdes to prohibit absolutely the printing,
selling, reading, or possessing of such books, and to order, under
the customary penalties, the delivery and destruction of all copies
of the same. To the Inquisitor-General is given the fullest authority
in the matter and no appeals from his decisions will be entertained.
Paul makes no reference in the brief to the Index that had, under his
instructions, just been brought into print in Rome, and while this is
in form addressed to the whole world, the Pope appears to assume that
as far as the Spanish dominions are concerned, the matter of heretical
literature is to be left in the charge of the Spanish Inquisition. On
his part, Valdes makes no reference to the Index of Paul, although
it is hardly to be supposed that he had failed to examine it. In the
editorial preface, Valdes informs the scholars and others who may,
through ignorance of their character, have been led into possessing
and reading heretical books that these lists have been prepared for
their help and guidance. He says further that those who, with the
information presented in these catalogues, may continue to print,
import, sell, read, or possess copies of the books specified shall be
punished with a fine of two hundred gold ducats and with the greater
excommunication (_latae sententiae_.) Those who may take part in
the translating of these works shall be liable to the same penalties.
A curious exception is given in favour of Seb. Martinez, who is
permitted, under the instructions of the Inquisition, to print certain
of the forbidden works. At the close of the Index, the statement is
made that there are many heretical and dangerous books in addition to
those whose titles are here given, and that lists of these will be
issued later. In connection with the enforcement of the provisions of
the Index (a task which was carried out by the Inquisition of Spain
with a thoroughness that was never attempted elsewhere), the confessors
were instructed, under penalty of the “reserved excommunication,”
to secure from all their penitents information concerning heretical
literature possessed either by themselves or by others.

Through a brief of January 7th, Valdes is given authority, for a term
of two years, to take measures against bishops who may be charged
with the utilising of heretical literature, and, if necessary, to
relieve them of their duties and to place them in confinement. He is
instructed to report to the Curia such cases of arrest and to send to
Rome the record of the evidence. This special authority appears to
have been secured by Valdes for the particular purpose of proceeding
against Carranza, Archbishop of Toledo. Through a brief of January
11th, King Philip II is instructed to take such measures as might be
necessary for confirming and carrying into effect the regulations of
the Inquisition. Professors who had been applying themselves to the
study of Oriental languages were not to be freed from the obligation to
deliver up, under penalty of excommunication, (possibly for revision or
for the cancellation of heretical notes,) copies of the Scriptures in
Hebrew or in Greek. Such copies in the hands of the booksellers were to
be destroyed. Among the books specially marked out for sequestration,
were works of grammar containing the notes of Melanchthon (who was at
the time largely engaged in the compilation of school-books to replace
the earlier monkish texts); all Bibles printed in Germany since 1519
without the imprint of the publishers; the editions of St. Chrysostom
by Oecolampadius and Musculus (the first complete editions, by the
way, of the works of this Father that had yet appeared), and the
Commentaries of Vadiamus on Pomponius Mela.

The editions with heretical imprints, which had been proscribed by
Paul, of such authors as Lucian, Aristotle, Plato, and Seneca, were not
forbidden by Valdes.

The Index of Valdes differs from that of Paul in two respects:

First, the books are classified according to languages, the order
of arrangement being Latin, Spanish, Flemish, Low German, High
German, French, and Portuguese. The arrangement of titles is roughly
alphabetical, with frequent confusion in connection with forenames and
surnames.

Secondly, Valdes does not undertake to present the three classes which
had been accepted as a precedent for the Roman Indexes. Class I may be
said, however, to find place in the general alphabet in which appear
the names of a number of authors with the prohibition of _opera omnia_.
The formula _donec corrigatur_ does not find place in the Valdes Index.

A large portion of the titles in this Valdes Index are taken from
the lists in the Spanish reprint of the Louvain Index of 1550. It is
difficult to trace the principle on which either the omissions or the
selections of these Louvain titles have been arrived at. The additions
made by the compilers of the Inquisition cover in the main such of the
Reformation writings as had found their way into Spain through the
Low Countries. The editors make no reference to preceding Indexes but
present this as if it could be accepted as a substantially complete
guide for believing readers. The _Historia Ecclesiastica_ of Albert
Kranz (1517) finds place in the Valdes Index for the first time among
prohibited books. Bellarmin writes later that the editions of this
historian are to be condemned simply on the ground of the godless notes
added by heretical editors.

A noteworthy title which also here first finds condemnation is that of
the _Gesta Romanorum_. The compilation of these old legends of the
Church has been ascribed to the Cistercian Helimand (†1227). This book
was first condemned in 1472, when the first printed edition was issued
in Cologne. It was often reprinted. An edition was issued in New York
as late as 1901.

Another prohibited title is that of _Hortulus Animae Absque Nomini
Authoris_. Of this book there had been a great variety of editions,
in one or more of which heretical editors had included scoffing
pictures. The text included fifteen prayers of St. Bridget. Of these
prayers it was said that if they should be repeated during an entire
year, fifteen souls would be saved from everlasting punishment. In the
same edition, there is a prayer to the Virgin to which was ascribed
especial soul-saving value. In Aragon, for instance, in the year 1290,
one sinner who had during the preceding year sung this hymn daily,
was able, after being beheaded, to retain his soul in the body until
all his sins had been confessed and he had received absolution. It
would seem as if this book belonged to the class that should have been
retained _donec corrigatur_.[119]

Llorente, in his description of this Index, refers to a story of Saint
Theresa, who, when she complained of the unjust proscriptions of
certain orthodox books, was answered by the Lord: “Disturb not thyself,
I will give thee the book of life.”

The entry in the Index of 1559 under the name Desiderius Erasmus is
noteworthy. The name is placed in Class I, comprising authors all of
whose writings are prohibited. After the name of Erasmus however,
there follows a specific prohibition as follows: _Cum universis
Commentariis, Annotationibus, Scholiis, Diologis, Epistolis, Censuris,
Versionibus, Libris et Scriptis suis, etiam si nil penitus contra
Religionem vel de Religione contineant_. This specific condemnation,
in addition to that expressed under the term _opera omnia_, would
appear to have included the edition prepared by Erasmus of the Greek
Testament. It may be borne in mind, however, that the latter had
secured the approval and very cordial commendation of Pope Leo X, to
whom the work had been dedicated. The Pope wrote, in 1516, a letter in
which he emphasises the exceptional service rendered by Erasmus in
this work to the study of sacred theology and to the maintenance of
the true faith. A curious comment made upon this action of the Pope,
in the Spanish Index of 1612, may be inserted here. In the expurgatory
division, under the article devoted to _Erasmi Roterodami Opera_,
at the beginning of the censures on the sixth volume, is printed: _Ad
marginem Epistolae Leonis P. P. X. ad Erasmum, quae incipit, Dilecte
Fili, salutem, et adscribe: Dulcibus encomiis pius Pater nutantem ovem
allicere conatur_ (“With gracious commendations the Holy Father
endeavours to attract [win back] the wandering sheep”).[120]

Another noteworthy detail in the Index of 1559 is the entry in the
list of works condemned of the title _Liber inscrip. consilium * * *
de emendanda ecclesia_. This _Consilium_ was a report presented by an
assembly of four cardinals (including the Englishman, Pole) and five
prelates, which had been instructed by Pope Paul III, in 1537, to
give him counsel in regard to the reform of the Church. The report or
_Consilium_ was more outspoken (in regard to corruptions, etc.) than
was considered desirable, and when one of the body, Cardinal Caraffa,
assumed the tiara (as Paul IV) he caused his own _Advice_ to be placed
on the list of prohibited books. The Index of 1559 also contains a
condemnation of the work by Aeneas Sylvius (afterwards Pius II),
_Commentaria de actis et gestis Concilii Basileen_. In the Tridentine
Index, this condemnation is modified to read, _In actis Aeneae Silvii
prohibentur ea quae ipse in bulla retractationis damnavit_. It is not
out of order to assume that when a man has become a pope, he may be in
a position to see things more clearly and to correct the errors of his
fallible days.

_14._ _1559._ _Rome._ This is the year of the accession of Paul IV, by
whose name the Index of 1559 is known. Its lists were in part based
upon the Louvain Index of 1558, and were themselves utilised in the
preparation of the Tridentine Index of 1564. It was published during
the second interregnum in the council, 1552–1562. The title is:

_Index Auctorum et Librorum qui ab officio Sanctae Rom. et
Universalis Inquisitionis caveri ab omnibus et singulis in universa
Christiana Republica mandantur, sub censuris contra legentes, vel
tenentes libros prohibitos in Bulla quae dicta est in Coena Domini
expressis et sub aliis poenis in Decreto ejusdem Sacri officii
contentis. Index venundatur apud Antonium Bladum. Cameralem impressorem
de mandato speciali Sacri Officii, Romae Anno Domini, 1559, Mense
Jan._

This is followed by the prohibitory decree of the Inquisition, with a
specification of the punishments for transgression as set forth in the
_Bulla Coenae Domini_. To these penalties are added others, _nostro
arbitrio infligendis_. The chief penalty was the _excommunicatio latae
sententiae_. The Index itself is presented in three schedules or
divisions arranged alphabetically: I. Authors, all of whose writings,
past or future, are condemned. II. Books, classified by authors. III.
Anonymous works.

Then follows a list of _Biblia Prohibita_, and of New Testaments, with
a general prohibition of all similar translations; and finally a list
of sixty-one printers (printer-publishers) all of whose publications
are condemned. The formula _donec corrigatur_, later so general, occurs
in this Index but once. It is connected with Boccaccio’s _Decameron_.
In Trent, the prohibition was confirmed subject to expurgation.
The text of the _Decameron_ was duly corrected by a commission of
five, and thus corrected was published in Florence in an authorised
and privileged edition in 1572. The revision eliminated from the
_Decameron_ the obnoxious references to ecclesiastics, but left in the
text a number of episodes _contra bonos mores_ which had to do only
with laymen. The revisers had, in some of the stories, changed the nuns
into noble ladies, the monks to conjurers, an abbess to a countess,
etc.[121] Paul includes in his Index a prohibition of the treatise
or report that had been prepared in 1538, under the instructions of
Paul III, by a commission of nine and printed in the papal printing
office under the title of _Consilium delectorum cardinalium et aliorum
praelatorum de emendanda ecclesia_. Cardinal Caraffa, later Paul IV,
was a member of the commission. The _Consilium_ was issued by Luther,
in 1539, in a German version, with a polemical commentary. It was again
printed by the ever-watchful Vergerio in 1559, the year of Caraffa’s
elevation to the Papacy. Vergerio did not fail to point out that the
Pope was condemning a work for the production of which he was himself
in part responsible. The prohibition remained on the Index until 1758.
In the Index of this year, the prohibition was modified so as to cover
only the editions printed with heretical commentaries. The work closes
with a form of license to be secured for the reading of the works
prohibited. This license was, for some reason, omitted from the later
reprints of the Index.

The Index of Paul is described by the Catholic historian Gretser, but
he admits that his information concerning it is derived from the
Protestant critic Vergerio. This is the first Index prepared under
the direct supervision of the Pope, and the first which bears the
official designation of “Index,” the previous lists having been termed
catalogues. Editions of Paul’s Index appeared within the year 1559
in Bologna, Venice, Genoa, and Avignon. In 1560, the indefatigable
Vergerio reprinted it with a critical, or rather polemical
introduction. In the same year, Vergerio published, separately,
a treatise (in Latin and Italian) devoted to an attack upon the
inquisitors who were responsible for the Index of Paul IV.

The title of the Latin edition of Vergerio’s work reads: _Postremus
Catalogus Haereticorum Romae Conflatus. 1559. Continens Alios Quatuor
Catalogos qui post Decennium in Italia nec non eos omnes qui in Gallia
et Flandria post renatum Evangelium fuerunt editi. Cum Annotationibus
Vergerii, MDLX Colophon, Corvinus excudebat Pfortzheimii, 1560._
The volume is dedicated to Count Stanislaus. The Italian edition was
printed at Ulm and dedicated to the King of Bohemia. The author’s
preface is dated from Tübingen. The author states that the Index or
Catalogue of 1559 was concocted by the Pope with the concurrence of six
inquisitors only. Vergerio goes on to say that when, ten years back,
the Pope observed that the Gospel and books favourable to the Gospel
were making their way into Italy, he published, in imitation of the
divines of the Sorbonne and of Louvain, a small catalogue condemning
seventy books.

The _Annotations_ of Vergerio, irrespective of the interest of their
severe criticisms on the judicial action and the bibliographical
blunders of the inquisitors, have proved of service in preserving the
most complete enumeration of the Italian Indexes prior to 1559. The
sources of information concerning these earlier Indexes are, in fact,
so scanty and in the main so untrustworthy that the papal historians
themselves have been under the necessity of accepting the record of
their Protestant critic.

The task of compiling the Index of 1559 had been confided by Paul
to Cardinal Caraffa and his associates of the Roman Inquisition. An
impression was struck off in 1557, but was cancelled on account of
errors that had come to light. The lists as reprinted in 1559 had had
the advantage of collation with the Louvain Index of 1558. The papal
brief (dated December 21, 1558) follows in the main the text of that of
Julius III, of 1550, but there is some new material. One of the earlier
sentences is typical of the difficulty of the problems with which the
Church found itself confronted:

   “A number of ecclesiastics, both regular and secular, who were
   hopeful of being able to combat the Lutherans and the other
   heretics of our time and to overthrow their heretical doctrines,
   and who secured for the purpose permission from the Apostolic
   Chair to read the works of these heretics, found themselves
   confused and influenced by these writings so that they were
   quite largely led astray and perverted into the acceptance of
   heretical errors. It has therefore, been found necessary to
   recall and to cancel all such permits issued in Briefs or in
   Bulls, whether given to bishops, archbishops, or cardinals, to
   marquises, dukes, kings, or emperors.”

The only exceptions to this general cancellation are in the case of
the inquisitors-general and certain cardinals, who may, from time to
time, be charged by the Curia with special duties in the examination
and classification of literature. Copies of the books condemned are
to be delivered to the officials appointed by the Inquisition for
the purpose. All the faithful are charged with the duty of giving
information concerning such copies as may become known to them. The
brief is to be published in Rome by the Inquisition and elsewhere by
each bishop in his own diocese. The lists in the first class include
(given, for the most part, in two places under both surname and
forename) Calvin, Luther, Melanchthon, Zasius, Pirckheimer. Cassander,
Blaurerus, Oecolampadius, Zwingli, Islebius, and Hütten (printed
Huldrychus Huttenus). English names to be noted are John Rogers
(printed John Rochors), Nicholas Ridley (Nic. Ridlaeus), and Thos.
Cranmer. The name of Erasmus, omitted here, finds place in Class II
against several of his works. These lists are, says Vergerio, marked by
many errors and inconsistencies. In the third class, under the heading
_Libri_ are given certain general prohibitions of which the
following may be cited as examples:

All books and tracts (pamphlets) are forbidden, whatever may be their
titles, or their subject-matter, and in whatever language they may be
written ... and whether they be original productions or translations,
which have been written by heretics, or which may be printed by
heretics ... even when such books contain no material bearing upon
faith or religion.[122] Also all books which, within the preceding
forty years have been issued without the name of the author, and the
name and address of the printer, or for which have not been secured
the approval and license of the bishop or inquisitor, or of some
other official appointed for the purpose by the pope or by the
inquisitors. Record of such permit must be printed in each copy of the
book. Forbidden also are all books having to do with the subjects of
aeromancy, cheiromancy, physiognomy, geomancy, hydromancy, oneiromancy,
pyromancy, or necromancy, divination, magic, or astrology, (exceptions
are made in favour of treatises on natural science planned for the
guidance of mariners, agriculturists, or physicians); and all books
which have been or shall be condemned under the decrees of popes or of
councils.

The prohibition of every work that had been produced, or that might
thereafter be produced, from the presses of printers classed as
heretics (of whom sixty-one were specified by name) constitutes
a new feature in the system of Indexes, and is evidence of the
importance that had come to be associated with the influence of the
printer-publishers of the time. The list is alphabeted by forenames.
It comprises: for Augsburg 1, Sig. Grym; for Basel 15, the most
important being the brothers Petri, Oporinus, Cratander, and Wolfius;
for Frankfort 1, Brubachius; for Genoa 5; for Marburg 2; for Hagenau 1;
for Leipzig 2, Blum and Wohlrab; for Nuremburg 5, including Montanus;
for Poschlav (Bohemia) 3; for Strasburg 9, including Ulricher and
the brothers Richelius; for Tübingen 1, Morhadius; for Venice 1,
Brucciolus; for Wittenburg 5, including Rau, Crato, and Klug; for
Zurich 3, including Gesner; for Paris 1, but that one noteworthy,
Robert Estienne, the most scholarly publisher of his generation;
without specification of place, 5. The selection of firms gives an
indication of the places which in this matter of heretical publishing
were at that time considered to be the sources of danger for the
doctrines and for the believers of the Church. The omission of any name
from the Low Countries would indicate that the books from the Dutch and
Flemish presses were not making their way into Italy and were not known
to the members of the Roman Inquisition.

Christopher of Padua, General of the Augustinians, who had had to do
with this Index, stated at Trent that in the work of its preparation,
careful examination had been made of all the heretical books in the
library of the Vatican. The compilers had utilised, in addition to the
lists of Louvain, of Venice, and of Casa, certain lists which Reusch
traces to the “Library” (Bibliothek) of Gesner, and to Cochlaeus’s
_Historia de Actis et Scriptis M. Lutheri_. Further titles are taken
from the “Letters” of Oecolampadius and of Zwingli. Certain omissions
of noteworthy and “deserving” names or titles, which were available in
previous lists, such as Beza, recorded in the Venice Index, and the
_Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum_, which appears in Louvain, were due
doubtless simply to oversights in transcribing. A curious entry in
Class II is _Arturus Britannus_, which stands for the _Legend of King
Arthur_ and which is responsible for the appearance in later Indexes
of the heretical author “Thomas Arturus.” The entry in Class I of the
name of an author was not permitted to stand in the way of a separate
condemnation in Class II or in Class III (under individual titles) of
his more pernicious productions.

This Index of Paul IV seemed to call for some special measure of
attention in this schedule, because it is the first prepared in
Rome under the direct instructions of the pope, and because in its
general purpose and policy, in the method of its compilation, in its
characteristic features, and its bibliographical errors, it was
typical of the whole series of Indexes, and was in fact quite closely
followed not only by that of Trent, but by not a few of those that
came later. The policy of the Church in its contest with the perils of
an uncontrolled printing-press may be said to have been marked out in
1559 by Paul IV and his associates. The fact that the lists included,
in addition to works by admitted heretics and to those concerned with
matters of theology, faith, and dogma, a number of books by Catholic
writers in good standing, others whose subjects were entirely outside
of theology and religion, and a further number whose only fault was
that of being printed by heretical printers, is an indication of the
wide view taken by the framers of the Index, and doubtless by Paul
himself, as to the responsibilities of the Church in the supervision of
literature. The Index of Paul may also be considered as a declaration
that the responsibility for the supervision and characterisation of
literary productions belonged properly to the head of the Church and
could not safely be left to be cared for by princes, universities, or
local inquisitors. It seems very probable that Paul and his advisers
of the Roman Inquisition had such a contention in mind, but as the
record of the production of later Indexes makes clear, the authorities
in Rome proved unequal to the task of controlling the prohibition
of books, and were obliged to accept, with more or less protest, a
considerable series of Indexes compiled under the direction of kings,
princes, universities, local inquisitors, and local ecclesiastics. The
fact that the work came to be carried on by a number of authorities
of varying character and with certain inevitable differences of
purpose, of policy, and of method, caused the results to be more
or less inconsistent and incongruous. An obedient believer, whose
desire was simply to accept and be guided by the instructions of the
authorities, might easily have found himself not a little perplexed at
the conflicting instructions that came to him in regard to this matter
of pernicious literature, in the two centuries between the Index of
Louvain and that of Benedict XIV. An example of the effect produced
by this Index on the mind of one Roman scholar is given in a letter
written in January, 1559 (immediately after the publication of the
Index) by Latinus Latinius to Andrea Masius[123]:

   “Why should you be planning for the publication of any new
   works at a time when nearly all the books which have thus far
   appeared (_qui adhuc sunt editi_) are being taken away from
   us? It seems to me that at least for some years to come, no one
   among us will dare to write anything but letters. There has
   just been published an Index of the books which, under penalty
   of excommunication, we are no longer permitted to possess. The
   number of those prohibited (particularly of works originating
   in Germany) is so great that there will remain but few. On
   this ground, I advise you to put to one side your variants of
   the Bible and the translation of Demosthenes. Faernus has been
   devoting some days to the ‘purifying’ of his library; I shall
   begin to-morrow going over my own collection so that nothing may
   be found in it which is not authorised. Should I describe the
   process as a shipwreck or a holocaust of literature? In any case
   this [censorship] must have the result of deterring many of your
   group from the production of books, and will serve as a warning
   to the printers to be cautious in making selections for their
   presses.”

It may be understood, although it is not specifically so stated, that
the books delivered over to the bishops or inquisitors were burned.
Natalis Comes writes (possibly with some rhetorical exaggeration),
“There was everywhere such a conflagration of books, that one was
reminded of the burning of Troy. Neither private nor public libraries
were spared, and many were nearly emptied.... In all the cities of
Italy, readers were mourning for their lost treasures.”[124] A letter
from Bologna dated February 11, 1559, says: “The prescriptions of the
Index are obeyed here. Nothing is permitted but the _Thesaurus linguae
latinae_ and the _Commentaries_ of Dolet. Of the writings of Erasmus,
one is permitted to retain nothing but one or two of the translations
[of the Fathers] and in these the name of the translator must be
cancelled.”[125]

Bullinger writes to Ambrose Blaurer: “In Rome, Paul IV is burning
books, and among others, all the writings of Erasmus. Even the works
of Cyprian, Jerome, and Augustine are included because they have been
rendered pernicious through the notes of Erasmus.”[126]

Paul IV died in August, 1559, and after his death, the enforcement
of the provisions and regulations of his Index was very materially
relaxed. In Venice (a State which in connection with its early and
important interests in the production of books maintained from the
outset a protest against the efforts of Rome to control the work of
the printing-press) this Index was never put into force. The Viceroy
of Naples and the Governor of Milan refused to permit the publication
of the Index in their territories, but referred the matter to the
King of Spain. The magistrates of Basel, Zurich, and Frankfort and of
other centres of book-production made application to Cosmo, Duke of
Tuscany, to protect the interests of their printers. A report prepared
for Cosmo by the jurist Livio Torelli stated that the execution of the
papal decree would bring upon Florence an immediate loss in property of
100,000 ducats, and would cause the ruin of the printer-publishers and
booksellers whose business was of increasing importance to the city;
while it would also call for the destruction of the supplies of Bibles
and classics and of other valuable literature which had been produced
for Italian scholars by the printers of Germany and of France. Under
pressure from the Cardinal of Alessandria, the Duke finally ordered the
burning of all books which were opposed to religion and of those having
to do with magic and astrology, which order was duly carried out on the
8th of March on the Piazza San Giovanni. The Duke refused to permit the
destruction of books outside of those two classes, and (as patron of
the monastery) prohibited the monks of San Marco, who wanted to carry
out the decree in full, from burning any of the volumes presented by
his predecessors to the library of the monastery. Outside of Italy,
excepting in the town of Avignon, very little attempt was made to put
into force the provisions of the Index. In Spain, it was never brought
into print. In France, the application for a privilege to print was
referred to a committee of doctors of the Sorbonne, and from this
committee no report appears to have been made. Arias Montanus writes
November 16, 1571: “This Index has caused indignation to all scholars,
and not only in France and in Spain, but in many portions of Italy,
they decline to respect its injunctions.”[127] Even in the preface to
the Index of Trent, it is noted that the Index of Paul IV had failed
to secure acceptance in many provinces because it included in its lists
of prohibited books many whose use was essential for scholars. In
several respects, the framers of the Index of Trent, which became the
authority for the Church, found occasion to modify and to mitigate the
sweeping severity of the provisions of the Index of Paul, while Valdes,
Inquisitor-General of Spain, refused to permit these provisions to be
put into force within that kingdom. It is evident that the officials
who had, under the instructions of Paul, compiled this first Roman
Index were considered by many of their contemporaries, as well as by
their successors, to have done their work in too sweeping a fashion,
and with an ignorance, or a disregard of, the legitimate requirements
of scholars in good standing within the Church, who had a just claim to
consideration.

A repeated complaint on the part of the critics of the censorship
operations under Paul IV was the ignorance and the heedlessness of the
examiners who had in their hands the responsibility for passing upon
the works of scholars. The books of the great leaders of thought were,
it was charged, placed under the control of ignorance and mediocrity.
The work of a learned commentator of St. Chrysostom or of the Psalmist
was to be condemned by examiners who had no knowledge either of Greek
or of Hebrew. Under such a system, it might still be possible for
scholars to carry on their researches with a patience adequate for the
production of compilations, but it was not possible to preserve for
original thinkers the serenity of soul and the independence of spirit
required for the production of really great works.




                             CHAPTER VIII

         THE COUNCIL OF TRENT AND THE INDEX OF PIUS IV, 1564.


_Rome, 1564._ _Pius IV, Council of Trent._--_Index librorum
prohibitorum cum regulis confectis per Patres a Tridentinae Synodo
delectos, auctoritate Sanctis D. N. Pii IV Pont. Max., comprobatus.
Romae, apud Paulum Manutium, Aldi F. 1564._

This is the first Index which has behind it the authority of a general
council.

As early as April, 1546, in the fourth session, a papal decree entitled
_De editione et usu librorum sacrorum_ was received and accepted
by the council. This presents the general grounds for the authority
of the Vulgate, the principles that are to control the interpretation
of the Scriptures, a prohibition of any wrongful use or citations of
the works of the Bible, and, finally, instructions to the council to
frame regulations for the supervision and control of the work of the
printing-press, “the operations of which as now uncontrolled tend to
pernicious license and injury to the faith of the community and to the
authority of the Church.” Certain suggestions follow concerning the
necessity for a close supervision of the text of the Scriptures to the
end that it may be printed without error, omission, or interpolation,
and the further necessity of forbidding the printing of any books
having to do with religion or with the Scriptures which have not
secured the approval of examiners appointed by the Church. The approval
of such books must be given in writing and must be recorded in every
written or printed copy. Anonymous books must in no case receive
approval.[128]

Two archbishops, Beccatelli and Selvaggio, deprecated the discussion
of the subject as calculated to impede the principal object of the
council; since Paul IV had, with the counsel and assistance of all
the Inquisitions, formed a most complete catalogue, nothing could be
added but books edited within the two years that had elapsed since
its publication, an act undeserving of the labour of the synod. To
reverse any condemnation in that Index would be to reflect imprudence
on Rome; and while such action would lessen the authority of the Index
of Paul, it would also injure the Council itself. In the redundance of
books since the invention of printing, it were better that a thousand
innocent ones should suffer than that one guilty should escape. Neither
should reasons be given which would provoke opposition and would impair
the dignity of laws that ought to rest simply upon their own authority.
Correction and expurgation were likewise deemed inexpedient as tending
to invite criticism and to make enemies. A contrary opinion, however,
prevailed and at the eighteenth session, a decree was passed declaring
that as the disease of pernicious books had not yielded to the salutary
medicine hitherto applied, it was deemed proper that certain Fathers
should be appointed diligently to examine and to state to the council
what was necessary to be done respecting the censure of books. In its
last session, the council referred to the judgment of the pope the work
that had been prepared by its committee, and publication of the same
was made in Rome in 1564.

The most permanent portion of the work of this council was the series
of Ten Rules prepared as a guide and instruction for all ecclesiastics
or other authorities who might thereafter be charged with the duty
of literary censorship. These Rules were reprinted in nearly all
subsequent papal Indexes, while in the Spanish Indexes they formed
the basis of the more or less modified Rules promulgated by the
inquisitors. Sixtus V (1585) replaced the Tridentine Rules with a new
series of regulations, but they were reissued by Clement VIII (1592)
with a few additions. They find place in the two Indexes of Leo XIII,
1896 and 1900.


             _The Ten Rules of the Tridentine Index_[129]

I. All books condemned by the supreme pontiffs, or general councils,
before the year 1515, and not comprised in the present Index, are,
nevertheless, to be considered as condemned.

II. The books of heresiarchs, whether of those who broached or
disseminated their heresies prior to the year above-mentioned, or of
those who have been, or are, the heads or leaders of heretics, as
Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, Balthasar, Pacimontanus, Swenchfeld, and
others similar, are altogether forbidden, whatever may be their titles
or subjects. And the books of other heretics, which treat professedly
upon religion, are totally condemned; but those which do not treat
upon religion are allowed to be read, after having been examined and
approved by Catholic divines by order of the bishops and inquisitors.
Those Catholic books also are permitted to be read which have been
composed by authors who have afterwards fallen into heresy, or who,
after their fall, have returned into the bosom of the Church, provided
these have been approved by the theological faculty of some Catholic
university, or by the general Inquisition.

III. Translations of ecclesiastical writers, which have been hitherto
published by condemned authors, are permitted to be read, if they
contain nothing contrary to sound doctrine. Translations of the Old
Testament may also be allowed, but only to learned and pious men,
at the discretion of the bishop; provided they use them merely as
elucidations of the Vulgate version, as a means of understanding the
Holy Scriptures, and not in place of the sacred text itself. But
translations of the New Testament made by authors of the first class
of this Index are allowed to no one, since little advantage, but much
danger, generally arises from reading them. If notes accompany the
versions which are allowed to be read, or are joined to the Vulgate
edition, they may be permitted to be read by the same persons as
the versions, after the suspected places have been expunged by the
theological faculty of some Catholic university, or by the general
inquisitor. On the same conditions, also, pious and learned men may be
permitted to have what is called the Bible of Vatablus, or any part of
it. But the preface and _Prolegomena_ of the Bible published by
Isodorus Clarius are, however, excepted; and the text of his editions
is not to be considered as the text of the Vulgate edition.

IV. Inasmuch as it is manifest from experience that if the Holy Bible,
translated into the vulgar tongue, be indiscriminately allowed to
every one, the temerity of men will cause more evil than good to arise
from it, this matter is referred to the judgment of the bishops, or
inquisitors, who may, by the advice of the priest, or confessor, permit
the reading of the Bible, translated into the vulgar tongue by Catholic
authors, to those persons whose faith and piety, they apprehend, will
be augmented, and not injured, by it; and this permission they must
have in writing. But if any one shall have the presumption to read or
possess it without permission, he shall not receive absolution until
he have first delivered up such Bible to the ordinary. Booksellers,
however, who shall sell or otherwise dispose of Bibles in the vulgar
tongue to any person not having such permission, shall forfeit the
value of the books, to be applied by the bishop to some pious use; and
be subjected to such other penalties as the bishop shall judge proper,
according to the quality of the offence. But regulars shall neither
read nor purchase such Bibles without a special license from their
superiors.

V. Books of which heretics are the editors, but which contain little or
nothing of their own, being mere compilations from others, as lexicons,
concordances, apophthegms, similies, Indexes, and others of a similar
kind, may be allowed by the bishops and inquisitors, after there have
been made, with the advice of Catholic divines, such corrections and
emendations as may be deemed requisite.

VI. Books of controversy betwixt the Catholics and heretics of
the present time, written in the vulgar tongue, are not to be
indiscriminately allowed, but are to be subject to the same regulations
as Bibles in the vulgar tongue. As to those works in the vulgar
tongue which treat of morality, contemplation, confession, and similar
subjects, and which contain nothing contrary to sound doctrine, there
is no reason why they should be prohibited; the same may be said also
of sermons in the vulgar tongue, designed for the people. And if in
any kingdom or province, any books have been hitherto prohibited as
containing things not proper to be read without selection by all sorts
of persons, they may after correction, if written by Catholic authors,
be allowed by the bishop and inquisitor.

VII. Books professedly treating of lascivious or obscene subjects,
or narrating or teaching these, are utterly prohibited, since not
only faith but morals, which are readily corrupted by the perusal
of them, are to be considered; and those who possess them shall be
severely punished by the bishop. But the works of antiquity, written
by the heathen, are permitted to be read, because of the elegance and
propriety of the language; though on no account shall they be suffered
to be read by young persons.

VIII. Books, the principal subject of which is good, but in which some
things are occasionally introduced tending to heresy and impiety,
divination, or superstition, may be allowed, after they have been
corrected by Catholic divines, under the authority of the general
Inquisition. The same judgment is also given concerning prefaces,
summaries, or notes, taken from condemned authors, and inserted in the
works of authors not condemned; but such works must not be printed in
future, until they have been amended.

IX. All books and writings of geomancy, hydromancy, aeromancy,
pyromancy, onomancy, cheiromancy, and necromancy; or which treat of
sorceries, poisons, auguries, auspices, or magical incantations are
utterly rejected. The bishops shall also diligently guard against any
persons reading or keeping any books, treatises, or indexes which
treat of judicial astrology or contain presumptuous predictions of
the events of future contingencies, and fortuitous occurrences, or of
those actions which depend upon the will of man. But such opinions and
observations of natural things as are written in aid of navigation,
agriculture, and medicine are permitted.

X. In the printing of books or other writings, the rules shall be
observed which were ordained in the tenth session of the Council of
Lateran, under Leo X. Therefore, if any book is to be printed in the
city of Rome, it shall first be examined by the vicar of the pope or
by the master of the sacred palace or by other persons chosen by our
most holy Father for that purpose. In places other than Rome, the
examination of any book or manuscript intended to be printed shall be
referred to the bishop with whom shall be associated the inquisitor of
heretical pravity of the city or diocese in which the printing is done,
and these officials shall without charge, and without delay, affix
their approbation to the work, in their own handwriting, such approval
being subject, however, to the pains and censures contained in the said
decree; there is the further condition, that an authentic copy of the
book to be printed, signed by the author himself, shall remain in the
hands of the examiner; and it is the judgment of the Fathers of the
present deputation that those persons who publish works in manuscript
before these have been examined and approved, should be subject to the
same penalties as those who print them; and that those who read or
possess such books should be considered as the authors, if the real
authors of such writings do not avow themselves. The approbation given
in writing shall be placed at the head of the books, whether printed
or in manuscript, that they may appear to be duly authorised; and this
examination and approbation, etc., shall be granted gratuitously.

Moreover, in every city and diocese, the houses or places in which the
work of printing is carried on, and also the shops of booksellers,
shall be frequently visited by persons deputed for that purpose by
the bishop or his vicar, conjointly with the inquisitor of heretical
pravity, so that nothing that is prohibited may be printed, kept, or
sold. Booksellers of every description shall keep in their libraries a
catalogue, signed by the said deputies, of the books which they have
on sale, nor shall they keep, or sell, nor in any way dispose of,
any other books, without permission from the deputies, under pain of
forfeiting the books, and of liability to such other penalties as shall
be judged proper by the bishop or inquisitor, who shall also punish
the buyers, readers, or printers of such works. If any persons import
foreign books into any city, they shall be obliged to announce them
to the deputies; or if this kind of merchandise be exposed to sale in
any public place, the public officers of the place shall signify to
the said deputies that such books have been brought; and no one shall
presume to read, or lend, or sell any book which he or any other person
has brought into the city, until he has shown it to the deputies,
and obtained their permission, unless it be a work well known to be
universally allowed.

Heirs and testamentary executors shall make no use of the books of
the deceased, nor in any way transfer them to others, until they have
presented a catalogue of them to the deputies, and have obtained their
license, under pain of confiscation of the books, or the infliction of
such other punishment as the bishop or inquisitor shall deem proper,
according to the contumacy or quality of the delinquent.

With regard to those books which the Fathers of the present deputation
shall examine, or correct, or deliver to be corrected, or permit to
be reprinted on certain conditions, booksellers and others shall be
bound to observe whatever is ordained respecting them. The bishops and
general inquisitors shall, nevertheless, be at liberty, according to
the authority they possess, to prohibit also such books as may appear
to be permitted by these rules, if they deem such prohibition necessary
for the good of the kingdom or province or diocese; and the secretary
of these Fathers, shall, according to the command of our holy Father,
transmit to the notary of the general inquisitor the names of the books
that have been corrected, as well as of the persons to whom the Fathers
have granted the power of examination.

Finally, it is enjoined on all the faithful that no one presume to keep
or read any books contrary to these Rules, or prohibited by this Index.
But if any one read or keep any books composed by heretics, or the
writings of any author suspected of excommunication, and those who read
or keep works interdicted on another account, in addition to the burden
of mortal sin, shall, at the discretion of the bishops, be severely
punished.

In advance of the Rules are printed the Bull of the Pope, dated Rome,
March 24, 1564, and a preface by Francis Forerius, secretary of the
deputation or commission which had been charged with the compilation
of the Index. Forerius states that this Index is intended to take the
place of that prepared at Rome by the inquisitors (that of Paul IV)
because that had included certain books which did not deserve to be
prohibited, and also because it had not been generally accepted.


                       _Notes on the Ten Rules_

I. This follows in substance the regulation of Paul IV. Sixtus added:
“To be excepted are certain books which, notwithstanding the errors
contained in them, the Church has found it desirable to preserve
as records of ecclesiastical traditions and old-time usages, or as
evidence to be used in the specification and condemnation of heretical
doctrines, as is set forth in the decree of Pope Gelasius I” (492).
Gelasius, however, does not prohibit the reading of the condemned
books, and in fact no such prohibitions occur before the 16th century.

II. A somewhat similar distinction between heresiarchs and ordinary
heretics finds place in Louvain, 1546. The definition of heresiarchs
might, however, have been made a little more precise for the
information of the faithful, or a complete list of them might have been
given, as was done later by Quiroga (1594) and by Sixtus.

III. The later Indexes of Sixtus (1585), Alexander VII (1655), and
Benedict XIV (1756) proscribed, with some slight modifications in the
wording, all editions of the Scriptures edited or printed by heretics.
Alexander added, “the Holy Script or any portions of the same which
have, since 1515, been printed in metrical form.” Benedict restricts
this prohibition to metrical versions produced by heretics.

IV. Paul IV had permitted the reading of the Bible in the vernacular
only under authorisation of the Inquisition. Sixtus replaced the
milder regulation of Trent with his rule No. 7. The possession of the
Scriptures or of portions of the Scriptures printed in the popular
tongue is prohibited except under special authority of the Curia.
Paraphrases in the vernacular are unconditionally condemned. In later
Indexes, the prohibition was extended to cover all “summaries” and
historical compends of the Bible in the vulgar tongue. The acceptance
of these prohibitions varied in different lands and in different times.
In Spain, a Bible had been printed in the dialect of Valentia as early
as 1478. The first issue in the vernacular after that date was that of
1790, edited by San Miguel, later Bishop of Segovia. A second appeared
in 1823, edited by Amat, Bishop of Barcelona.

The Lisbon Index of 1624 not only confirmed the prohibition of Bibles
and parts of the Bible, but added a new restriction in forbidding the
use in works of general literature (printed in the vernacular) of any
extracts from the Scriptures. This order called for the cancellation,
for instance, in the _Shepherds of Bethlehem_ of Lope de Vega, of
the poet’s versions of the _Magnificat_, the _Benedictus_, the _Nunc
Dimittis_, and the _Miserere_. In Italy, previous to 1560, a number
of translations of the Scriptures had been issued, but after the
prohibitions of Paul IV and of the Index of Trent, we find record of
Italian versions only of the Psalms and a few other portions, and these
could be read only with a formal permission. In 1596, Clement VIII
authorised the publication, by the Order of Jesus, of an edition in
the vernacular of the portions of the Gospels selected for reading on
Sundays and Saints’ days. It would appear, however, as if north of the
Alps, this proscription of the Scriptures in the vernacular failed to
secure any general enforcement, as during the 16th and 17th centuries
a large series of editions of the Scriptures and of the New Testament
were brought into print from Catholic translations, in French, German,
Bohemian, Hungarian, and Polish. The Jesuit Serarius, writing in 1612,
complains that “any one in Germany can read the Bibles of Eck or
Dietenberger, and in place of being reprimanded and punished by their
bishops and confessors, the delinquents are likely to be commended and
honoured.”

V. Sixtus orders further that the name of the heretical publisher
of the work must be cancelled and that of the “Expurgator” must be
specified. Benedict directs that dictionaries, thesauri, and similar
works compiled by heretics, “like the publications of the Stephani,
Scapula, J. J. Hofmann, etc.,” must, before being “permitted,” be
thoroughly “expurgated” of all material which may be antagonistic to
the Catholic faith.

VI. Sixtus directs that books written in the vernacular which combat
the doctrines of the Jews and Mohammedans, shall be read only under
authorisation of the Inquisition. In Germany, the prohibition against
the reading of controversial books printed in the vernacular secured
very little obedience and such books came, during the 16th century,
into very wide circulation.

VII. In the Index of Paul, there is recorded under this heading a
group of Priapean literature connected (erroneously) with the name of
Virgil. The only other classic author condemned as obscene is Lucian.
In the Lisbon Index of 1624, it is specified that the Epigrams of
Martial can be permitted only after expurgation, or in the text edited
by the Jesuits Fusius, Radius, and Augerius. Ovid’s erotic poems are
permitted “for private reading,” but for students only the _Epistolae
Selectae_ as edited at Tournay, 1615. Sixtus prohibits also obscene
pictures and collections of music containing amatory songs.

X. In 1625, the Inquisition of Rome issued an order prohibiting any
resident of the States of the Church from printing a book without the
permission, if within the city of Rome, of the cardinal vicar and the
_Magister_ of the palace, or if without the city, of the local
bishop. Alexander VII announced in the Bull of 1664, which accompanied
his Index, that only those penalties were still in force which were
specified in this tenth Rule and in the _Bulla Coenae_. Under this
decision, the excommunication _latae sententiae_ became no longer
applicable to those who might read writings of heretics but still held
good for the reading of books actually specified in the Index, of
vernacular versions of the Scriptures and controversial works, and of
works classed as obscene.

The enforcement in Germany of the penalties prescribed in Rule X was
a matter of dispute among the theologians as had before been the
authority of the _Bulla Coenae_. In 1869, these penalties were
rescinded by the Bull of Pius IX. In the same Bull, however, Pius
retained the “reserved excommunication” for the printing, reading,
etc., of books which had been specifically condemned (by titles), not
by the Inquisition, but by direct apostolic authority (papal Bulls,
briefs, or encyclicals). This specification would apparently cover the
books listed in the two Indexes issued under the direct authority of
Pius IX and probably holds good also for the works contained in the
two Indexes of Leo XIII.

       *       *       *       *       *

The Tridentine Index, presented with the full authority of the Church
represented by the Pope (Pius IV) and the general council, and compiled
after due deliberation, by a representative commission of scholarly
divines, secured a much wider distribution and more general acceptance
than had been obtained by the first of the papal Indexes or than could
have been expected for the comparatively local Indexes of Louvain,
Venice, or Valladolid. The Index was printed in 1564, either separately
or in connection with the record of the Decrees of the Council of
Trent, in Bologna, Modena, Florence, Cremona, Venice, Cologne, and
Dillingen, and during the remaining years of the century, in a great
number of editions. Within the next thirty years, there were no less
than ten issues from the presses of Venice (which was still one of the
most important centres of the printing industry) and four from Cologne.
Throughout the Catholic world, the interest was active and continued
in the proceedings and conclusions of the council which had undertaken
the task of cleansing the Church from its inner evils and of fortifying
its institutions against the assaults of the heretics without. The
deliberate policy of the Church in regard to the supervision of books
was expressed in the Ten Rules of its Index and in the accompanying
lists of prohibited books and of condemned authors, and these rules and
lists now came to the eyes of thousands of readers (or were cited to
them by their teachers and confessors) who had never before known of
ecclesiastical censorship. According to the understanding of the Curia,
no formal acceptance or confirmation was required to make binding in
the lands acknowledging the authority of the Church either the Bull or
the Index, but this was not the view generally taken.

In Belgium, Bavaria, and Portugal, the regulations of the Index were
formally adopted under royal edicts. Spain adhered to the policy of
leaving in the hands of the Spanish Inquisition the responsibility for
the preparation, and for the enforcement of, the successive Indexes,
and neither the Index of Trent nor any other issued under papal
authority was ever accepted as binding within the Spanish dominions.
The Ten Tridentine Rules were however adopted in the Spanish Indexes
appearing after 1564. In France and in Germany (outside of Bavaria)
the Index of Trent was confirmed and promulgated only by one or two
provincial synods. It is evident that in these countries the Rules
secured no general acceptance or authority. Reusch adduces as evidence
that the Roman authorities held the Tridentine Index to be universal in
its authority, certain instructions given in 1580 by Gregory XIII to
Toletus. Toletus, who had been sent to Germany and the Low Countries as
a papal representative, was empowered to absolve from excommunication
and from other ecclesiastical penalties, believers who had for
scholarly purposes retained or read books condemned as heretical,
provided they would promise to abandon the pernicious practice.

The decrees in regard to book-production issued during the succeeding
twenty years by the provincial synods of Italy repeated in substance
the regulations of Trent, with an occasional addition. In Milan for
instance, in 1583, the synod ordered that printers and booksellers
must, before securing permission to begin business, make a confession
of faith to the bishops and take an oath to conduct their business
according to the regulations of the Index.

In a number of the dioceses of France, similar edicts were issued,
but these made no reference to the papal Indexes. In 1566, King
Henry II ordered (at the instance of the theological faculty of the
Sorbonne) that no books prohibited by said faculty should be printed,
owned, or read. Further, he authorised the Sorbonne to make personal
examination of the stock of the booksellers. The supervision exercised
by the Sorbonne over the production and distribution of books worked
to the detriment of the book-trade of Paris, and to the advantage of
the printers and dealers of Lyons, Montpellier, and other provincial
centres, where it proved to be impracticable to enforce the regulations
of the Paris theologians. It was also a factor in building up in
Holland (which was practically free from censorship) the business of
producing books for the students of Europe.

In Germany, notwithstanding repeated efforts by successive popes, Pius
V, Gregory XIII, and others, and edicts by Maximilian II and Rudolf
II, it was evidently impracticable to keep control or supervision over
the productions of the rapidly increasing printing-presses, presses
which, instead of being concentrated as at Paris, were distributed
through a great number of widely separated towns. A letter written in
1582 by the Bishop of Vienna indicates that the lists in the Roman
editions of the Index were not accepted as final authority. “You can
permit the use of books printed in Munich, Ingolstadt, Cologne, and
other such towns [_i.e._ towns under good ecclesiastical influence]
but those from Wittenberg, Tübingen, etc., must be forbidden. It
will be well for the inspectors to take in their hands the catalogue
of the Frankfort Fair in which are given the titles of the Protestant
theological books. They will also find useful the Index as printed in
Cologne and in Venice.”[130] In 1566, Josias Simler writes: “A new
Index has been promulgated in which so many books are condemned that
many Italian professors complain they will no longer be able to deliver
their lectures. The Frankforters and Zürichers and other German cities
have written to the authorities of Venice begging them not to accept
the Index.”[131] Kirchhof speaks of the German book-trade with Italy as
being practically destroyed through the enforcement of the regulations
of Trent, while the book-dealers of Italy itself were isolated and in
many cases ruined.[132]

The Dominican Bernardo Castiglione writes, in 1581:

   “In Rome, there is at present much watchfulness concerning the
   books coming into Italy. The Inquisitors are charged with the
   duty of prohibiting or destroying copies of this work or that.
   As a result, the booksellers dare not give orders, and are often
   unable to sell the books they have received. I understand that
   there are now lying in the Roman shops unsalable books to the
   value of many thousand _scudi_.”[133]

A noteworthy omission in the catalogue of the Trent Index is the entire
list of condemned Bibles and Testaments which had constituted an
important division in the Index of Paul IV. Mendham calls attention to
the omission of the name of John della Casa.

Paul’s editors had placed the name of Erasmus in Class I (authors
all of whose writings were condemned) and had added a specification
which is connected with no other name, not even those of Luther and
Calvin: “with all his commentaries, criticisms, scholia, dialogues,
letters, translations, books, and writings, including those which have
nothing to do with the subject of religion.” In the Index commission
of Trent, after sharp discussions, this Draconian judgment was
materially modified. The name of Erasmus was placed in Class II, in
connection with the titles _Colloquia_, _Encomium Moriae_, _Christiani
Matrimonii Institutio_, and the _Paraphrasis in Matteum_ (as printed in
an Italian version under the name of Bernardine Tointano). The other
writings, including those that had already been condemned in Paris and
in Louvain, were left free. For the _Adagia_, a specific authority
was given to Paulus Manutius for the publication of an edition. Until
this edition should be in readiness, permission was given for the
use of the existing editions (the most noteworthy was that printed
in 1498 by Aldus), after certain reprehensible or doubtful passages
had been eliminated under the authority of the Inquisition or of a
theological faculty. In 1590, under the authority of Sixtus V, Erasmus
was again placed in Class I, and all of his writings “whatever their
subject-matter,” with the exception of the expurgated _Adagia_, were
condemned. In 1596, Clement VIII again confirmed for the writings
of Erasmus the classification of Pius IV. In the Spanish Indexes,
the name of Erasmus was, after 1612, retained in Class I. In 1575,
the expurgated edition of the _Adagia_ was issued in Rome under the
authority of the Church, without the name of the author. It would
be a little difficult to secure from these varying pronouncements
a trustworthy impression as to the final conclusions of the Church
authorities in regard to the seriousness of the heresies contained in
the writings of this scholarly Catholic or as to the actual value of
the books.

In the preface to the Trent Index, it is stated that those writers are
to be placed in Class I who are known as heretics or who are suspected
of heresy (_nota haeresis suspecti_). This phrase is capable of
varying interpretations and would appear to have been worded in order
to cover the cases of writers like Erasmus, who while refusing to class
themselves with the Protestants, had written or spoken with sharp
criticism of the Church. As a result of such an instruction, writers
like Staupitz, Pirckheimer, Hamer, and Billicanus find place in Class
I. There also were included by Paul, Rhenanus and Zasius, who were by
the Trent editors transferred to Class II.

Savonarola had suffered death as a heretic in 1498, but no reference
was made in the judgment to his writings. These came up for
consideration in the compilation of Paul’s Index, and were discussed
in several sessions of the Inquisition. They were condemned by
representatives of the Jesuits, the Augustinians, the Carmelites, and
the Franciscans, and were defended by certain Dominicans. It was the
desire of Paul to have the whole series condemned, and it is said that
as certain passages were read out loud the Pope stamped on the floor
and exclaimed, “This is pestilential teaching, it is Martin Luther
himself.”

It was finally decided to place in the Index the _Dialogo della verita
prophetica_ and fifteen of the sermons preached in 1496–98, including
that given at the ordeal of fire. The writings of Savonarola came
again into discussion at Trent when the commission concluded to permit
the reading of expurgated editions. In 1598, under the permission
of Clement VIII, an edition of Savonarola’s works was undertaken by
Cardinal Bonelli and Philip Neri, but was never completed. As late as
1837, was placed upon the Index (under Pius VIII) an edition of the
_Opere inedite_ di Fra Gir. Savonarola, _Libri cinque dell’ Italia_,
etc.

Clemangis, placed by Paul in Class I, is transferred by Trent to
Class II, with the specification that the works can be permitted when
expurgated. Geiler of Kaisersberg, placed by Paul in Class I, is left
out of the Index of Trent, but is replaced by Sixtus V and Clement VIII
in Class I, where his name still remains.

The Trent Index, like that of Paul IV, includes in Class I a number of
Italian authors whose works seem to be of hardly sufficient importance
to give warrant for the distinction. Among the names the grounds for
the condemnation of which are more easily to be understood may be
noted that of Petrus Paulus Vergerius. The record of Vergerio has
been referred to in connection with the Index of 1559. His thorough
knowledge of the methods followed by the compilers of the Italian
Indexes, his strenuous opposition to the policy of permitting literary
production to be controlled by the Inquisition, and his trenchant
controversial style, had rendered this convert to Protestantism one
of the most dangerous of the opponents of the Church. It is not
surprising, therefore that his name should have been singled out for
special condemnation. The compilers were also sufficiently painstaking
to trace and to include in their lists the titles of certain of
Vergerio’s writings which had been printed under a pseudonym or
anonymously.

In Class II, may be noted Italian translations of certain writings
of Luther which had been issued under the name of Fregoso (Federigo
Fregoso died in 1541, as Archbishop of Salerno.) Class III contains
further Italian translations of the treatise of Luther on the _Freedom
of Christian Men_ and of the _Address to the Christian Nobility of
Germany_. In the same class is entered the title _Il Beneficio di
Christo_ (also recorded as _Beneficium Christi_), the authorship of
which is ascribed to Dom Benedetto, a Benedictine of Mantua. This tract
was printed throughout Europe in various versions and secured a very
wide circulation. Vergerio speaks of forty thousand copies being sold
in Venice alone, within six months. The tract appears, however, to have
been very thoroughly suppressed, as copies are now scarce.

Among the non-theological Italian writers whose names find place in the
lists of Trent (and in other of the earlier Indexes) the following may
be noted: Dante, Macchiavelli, Boccaccio, and Guicciardini. The name
of Dante is connected with the treatise _De Monarchia_. The ground for
the condemnation was undoubtedly the same that, two centuries earlier,
had brought the author under the reprobation of John XXII, namely,
that Dante had ventured to assert that the authority of the emperor
was derived from God and not from God’s vicar on earth. The book had,
in 1318, been publicly burned in Lombardy. The name of Dante finds
place also in the expurgatory Index issued, in 1581, in Lisbon. The
_Commedia_ is prohibited until it has been officially expurgated,
and all copies are ordered to be delivered to the Inquisition for
correction. The _De Monarchia_ is referred to by Fox in his _Book of
Martyrs_. He speaks of Dante as “an Italian writer against the Pope.”
The name of Joan. Foxus and that of Oporinus (the Basel publisher of
the treatise) are placed in the Trent list. In the same Index, are
condemned certain passages from the commentary on the _Commedia_ by
Landino, in which it is asserted that heretics are not deserving of
death but simply of imprisonment. In a Greek version of the _Commedia_
recently published in Constantinople by Musurus Pacha, certain passages
are omitted which make uncomplimentary references to Mahomet.

Macchiavelli has, since Paul IV, been placed in Class I. His writings
are available for the faithful only under special authority of the
pope. Certain of the books are said by Brudini (writing in 1752) to
have found favour with Alexander VI, and with Clement VII. Under
Gregory XIII, 1572–85, the production of an expurgated edition of
Macchiavelli’s works was undertaken, but the plan was not carried out,
owing to the refusal of the Congregation to permit the books to be
printed with the name of the author. Villari speaks of having seen a
copy of an expurgated edition of the _Storie Fiorentini_, printed in
1551.[134] In 1605, under Clement VIII, a fresh prohibition was made
of an edition at Lausanne of the _Discours sur les moyens de bien
gouverner_.

The _Decameron_ of Boccaccio is entered in the Index of Trent with the
phrase: _quamdiu expurgatur ab iis, quibus rem Patres commiserunt, non
prodierunt_. An edition so expurgated was printed in Florence in 1573,
at the instance of Cosimo I. The “expurgations” had to do only with the
references to religion or to ecclesiastics. Except in the instances in
which the characters involved are monks or priests, the obscenities of
the original are retained in the expurgated edition.

Certain of the books of the notorious Aretino of Arezzo had been
included in the Index of 1559, and the prohibition is confirmed in the
Index of Trent. This author is condemned not (as might well have been
expected) on the ground of the pornographic character of his writings,
but because of their (alleged) heretical tendencies. Professor Paul
van Dyke points out that “when the influence of the Council of Trent
was being felt in reforming the abuses and restoring the discipline
of the Church, Aretino’s freedom in criticising the clergy became
offensive.”[135]

The works of Guicciardini which came into condemnation had to do with
the history of the development of the political authority of the
Papacy, a subject concerning which the Congregation of the Index was
always on the alert.

In the Index of Trent, a number of works on astrology and magic, which
had found place in the Index of Paul, were omitted.

       *       *       *       *       *

As before indicated, the classifications of the Tridentine editors
indicated a wider and more tolerant policy than had been followed by
the compilers of the Index of Paul IV. The change is to be credited in
part to the influence exercised in Trent by the delegates from Germany
and in part to the protests which had been called forth from scholars
in Italy and throughout the world by the severe prohibitions in Paul’s
Index, prohibitions which, as pointed out, were seriously hampering for
scholarly undertakings.

After the Council of Trent, there was for a series of years a decided
increase in the efforts of the authorities, political as well as
ecclesiastical, throughout Catholic realms, to repress the production
and the circulation of heretical and dangerous literature. In the
Spanish Low Countries, the regulations under the administration of Alva
were especially stringent. In the years 1566–7, in Antwerp alone, four
printers were banished, one was sentenced to the galleys for a term of
six years, and one was hanged.

Mendham remarks, in regard to the Council of Trent:

   “The Roman, beyond any other professedly Christian sect,
   is bound to its peculiar faith and discipline by original
   engagements the most sacred, the most precise, the most
   extended, the most rigorous. And it is there that we are to
   look for its true and distinguishing character. No greater
   mercy of the kind was ever vouchsafed to the Christian world by
   a compassionate Providence than the Council of Trent. However
   cautious the managers of this Council, they were obliged by
   many motives to speak out and declare themselves in canons, in
   decrees, in anathemas, and above all in a Creed, none of which
   can be recalled or concealed. The Indexes which emanated in
   great measure from this Assembly stand forth a specimen and
   illustration of the true character of the religion of Rome....

   “How can he who accepts the creed and oath of Pius IV, as the
   rule of his faith, or actually professes and swears it, and
   therein solemnly engages to _believe and profess all things
   defined_ more especially by the Council of Trent, from which
   all the subsequent Roman Indexes flow, feel himself at liberty,
   not as to the respect, but as to the degree of respect,
   due to the deliberate and constantly renewed expression of
   judgment on religious subjects by the most sacred of all human
   authorities?”[136]

It is the conclusion of Dejob that it was possible for a believer
living during the sixteenth century under the direct influence of the
Vatican to remain a good Christian, even to the point of intolerance,
but that he could hardly, under the existing conditions, attain to real
scholarship.[137]

       *       *       *       *       *

The work of the Council of Trent marks in more ways than one a
turning-point in the history of the Church of Rome. During the
half-century preceding the date of the council, the Protestant revolt
had wrested from the control of Rome nearly half of the territory of
Europe, and the authority of the Church had been shaken even in States
still classed as Catholic. The calling together of the council was the
result of a realisation on the part of the Papacy and its advisers that
the Protestant advance could not be stayed by simple reassertions of
the authority of Rome, or by threats or edicts of excommunication. The
Church must prove its right to rule, must in fact justify its continued
existence. The practice of the ecclesiastics must be brought into
conformity with ecclesiastical teachings. The claim that the Pope was
the Vicar of Christ, the Vice-Regent of the Almighty, could be made
good only through presenting practical evidence that the work of the
Church was guided by the divine precepts, and that the workers of the
Church were really the children of God.

The Council of Trent retained in its great Index the prohibition of
the writings of Erasmus, but the reforms initiated by the council
constituted a justification of the strictures of the great Hollander,
and in not a few instances these reforms simply carried out his
recommendations.

The divines of Trent did not hesitate to characterise Luther and his
associates as the “children of the devil,” but these same divines
placed on record condemnations hardly less specific than those that had
come from the preachers of Wittenberg, of the abuses and corruptions
that had taken possession of the Church of Christ.

If the work of the reformers of Trent could by any possibility have
been brought about fifty years earlier, we may imagine that the theses
of Luther might never have been posted, while the leaders of the
Protestant reform would have had available for their great contest no
adequate ammunition. It may at once, however, be admitted that the “ifs
of history” are at best but futile guesses. It is safer to conclude
that without such shaking up as was given by the Protestant revolt,
the reformation within the Church would never have been undertaken, or
would at least not have taken shape during the sixteenth century. It is
possible even that the loss of half of its realm was necessary if the
existence of the Church as an institution was to be maintained.

The history of the succeeding century makes clear that the Catholic
reformation was undertaken in good faith, and with a full measure of
devotion and earnestness, and that it brought about a great revival in
Christian spirit and a noteworthy advance in scholarship, in wisdom and
administration, and in faithful service on the part of the rulers, and
of zeal, faith, and good works among their flocks.

The popes who initiated the work of the Council of Trent and those
whose rule followed immediately the years of the council, showed a
very different standard of life and of official and personal action
than had characterised such popes as Julius II and Leo X, who had been
responsible for Church policy at the time of the Reformation. Paul
IV, Pius IV, Pius V, Gregory XIII, and Sixtus V led austere lives
and insisted that their courtiers should accept the same standard of
life. They were all earnest workers for the reform of the Church,
realising that its domination could be justified only by its purity,
its severity towards the rebellious, and its charity for the faithful.
The successful results of the work of the council had brought to
Catholicism confidence in itself; when the adherents of the Church
realised that the council had escaped the various perils that had been
prophesied, and that without any limitation to the ideal of domination,
without any abandonment of essentials to the demands of heretics,
the Church had made an emphatic condemnation of crying abuses, they
were able, with lessened anxieties and with large hopes for the
future, to look forward to the accomplishment of the promises made
to Christianity. The popes now commence seriously with the reform of
abuses in the Church, not only among its members, but with its rulers.
Nepotism is prohibited; the cardinals are brought back to a modest and
consistent way of living; the bishops are sent back to their dioceses;
the monks return to their convents. A beginning is made in good faith
with the correction of ecclesiastical manners and methods.

As one result of the reforms, Rome itself was awakened and, so to
speak, rehabilitated. The court of the popes, which, from the time of
Petrarch to that of Luther, had been denounced by so many eloquent
voices as the home of scandals and as the source of corruptions, had
thrown off its pernicious habits of life. Virtue and science were
once again held in honour, and Christian scholarship was placed in a
position to maintain, without too serious an inferiority, a continuity
with the profane erudition of the Renaissance. From this time, the
Catholics found themselves less embarrassed when confronted with the
names of their old-time critics, Erasmus and Melanchthon, and were no
longer under the necessity of blushing for the intellectual and moral
condition of their religious capital.[138]

It would appear from the general testimony of historians of literature
that, in spite of certain noteworthy exceptions, the reforms initiated
after the Council of Trent exercised a largely wholesome effect on the
character of Italian literature. The Italian historian Canello[139]
contends that the work of the ecclesiastical reformers not only
restored and preserved the Church, but purified and rehabilitated
society.

It is the contention of Dejob that by the close of the 16th century
the Catholic reformation had exerted in Italian literature an
influence that was both significant and lasting, while the effect on
the literature of Spain was hardly less marked although probably less
lasting. The Protestant peoples had, as he claims, thus far produced,
under the inspiration of religious feeling, no works that could equal
the religious productions of these two countries. It was during
the century following that the literature of France received from
Christianity its most profound impression.[140]

The correspondence of Cardinal Sirleto gives an indication of the
labour undertaken by the clergy of Italy after the Council of Trent
for the purpose of disputing with the Protestants the leadership in
science and in scholarship. Sirleto, who had had a chair of rhetoric
in the College of San Silvestro at Rome, was, in 1549, placed in
charge of the great library of the Vatican. Later, he became Bishop
and Cardinal, but resigned the honours of the Episcopacy in order
to devote himself exclusively to the pursuit of learning and to
the service of other scholars of the Church. The group of Catholic
writers who were, during the lifetime of Sirleto, devoting themselves
to scholarly labours included such names as those of Baronius,
Bellarmin, Tiraboschi, Latini, Orsini, and many others. Sirleto, with
a marvellously intimate knowledge of the great collections of the
Vatican that were under his control, devoted himself during a series
of years through correspondence, through suggestions, and through the
loan of manuscripts and books, to furthering the work of the writers
of this group. It would appear as if no Italian writer of the day who
was giving attention to dogma, to history, to tradition, to exegesis,
or even to general literature, was able to complete his work without
the co-operation of Sirleto. He typified in his own person the great
revival in scholarly and in literary interests that accompanied the
reform in morals and in religious zeal brought about by the Council of
Trent. The Protestant writers were no longer to be permitted to have a
monopoly of applied scholarship or in literary exposition for popular
reading. Men like Baronius devoted themselves in defence of the Church
to the proofs to be secured from history and tradition; while hundreds
of writers who had secured their training in the newly established
or newly revised schools of the Church, brought into print, for the
reading of the people generally, appeals and arguments with which
to offset the influence of the “flyleaves” of Wittenberg. It was in
fact through the furious attacks of Luther and his associates that a
comprehensive reformation was brought about in the army of Catholicism.

Among the correspondents of Sirleto who write soliciting permission for
the reading of prohibited books (a permission required in connection
with their work) may be noted Montanus, the editor of the Polyglot
Bible, Sigone, and Baronius. Sigone writes, for instance, in 1579:
“Every one knows that I can do nothing to bring to completion my
present task without an opportunity of reading the ‘Centuries’ of
Magdeburg; but the ‘Centuries’ are under excommunication, and I do not
know how I am going to be able to obtain a copy or to secure permission
to read the book. I hope very much that you may be interested in
serving me in this matter.”

Plantin writes to Sirleto stating that he has in plan an edition of
St. Augustine and asks the librarian to advise him of any variants in
the text of this Father, of which he has knowledge. He puts a similar
question concerning the possible requirement for corrections in texts
of the Scriptures, which corrections he could utilise in the Bible that
was being edited by Montanus. Later, he asks for aid from Sirleto in
connection with editions of St. Chrysostom and of St. Jerome which are
to be dedicated to the Pope.

The Spaniard Bartolomeo de Valverde, chaplain of Philip the Second,
who had rendered important collaboration in certain of the scientific
undertakings of the Vatican, writes in 1584 to Sirleto requesting the
renewal of the permission that had been accorded to him some time back
for the use of prohibited books. He alleges as one justification for
his request certain significant considerations concerning the character
of the examiners with whom rests the fate of books brought into
question. Bartolomeo understands that

   “among the men who are engaged in the production of the new
   Index, there are some whose judgment is so severe and whose zeal
   is so excessive that they have condemned books which they have
   never seen. The people whose judgment should count concerning
   books are of course those who through study have knowledge of
   their character. These compilers have not hesitated to condemn
   the works of many saints and (a loss much to be lamented) all
   the commentaries of the Jews.... The Pope has appointed as
   examiners men who do not know a word of Greek or Hebrew and who
   possess neither judgment or capacity. They are expected to read
   (without any payment for their time) a great mass of volumes and
   in order to get through easily with the repugnant task, they
   declare quite simply and with an air of large knowledge that the
   whole series must be suppressed.”

   Valverde prays Sirleto to help him to preserve his own
   library against the assaults of this “arbitrary and ignorant
   omnipotence.”[141]

It is to be borne in mind, says Dejob, that this letter comes not from
a Protestant, denouncing the unintelligent tyranny of the Papists, but
from a dignitary of the Spanish Church, who had been charged by the
Vatican with special responsibilities; while the Cardinal to whom his
application was addressed was himself the chief director of the work
of the Congregation of the Index. It is the conclusion of Valverde
that, as a necessary result of the existing conditions, the work of
censorship must, in large part at least, be placed in the hands of men
who are ignorant of the subjects confided to them. These men, charged
by the Pope with an enormous responsibility and with an authority for
which there is no supervision, are expected to do this work without
pay, and they may be said to give to the Church the equivalent of their
compensation.[142]

The nephew of the Cardinal, Marcello, who was his successor in
the Diocese of Squillace, was apparently in favour of a strenuous
application of censorship.

Marcello, writing to the Cardinal under date of November 2, 1570, says:

   “It seems to me essential that in affairs like this, having to
   do with heresy, one should proceed with full rigour rather than
   with too close attention to equity, for these matters concern
   the honour of God and that of the whole Catholic Church. As a
   Father of the Church has said, ‘_in hac re summa pietas esset,
   fuisse crudelem_.’ It is the perfection of piety to be ‘cruel’;
   that is to say, to be forcible in punishment.”

The examiners of the Congregation of the Index and those delegated
to consider the special subjects referred to the inquisitors found
themselves swamped by the mass of material submitted for their
consideration. The task of examining and of reporting upon the
literature of Europe, or even upon that portion of literature with
which the interests of the Church were directly concerned, was beyond
the powers of the men to whom it had been delegated. The authors whose
works were under consideration found themselves obliged to retain a
solicitor or a representative to watch over their interests and to do
what might prove practicable to hasten a favourable decision. Abbe
Alessandro Archirota writes to Sirleto, under date of February 23,
1572, complaining that a treatise of his which had been passed upon
with approval by Pirrotano, has rested in the hands of the Master of
the Palace for no less than fifteen months. The unfortunate author had
been obliged under the terms of his contract to make payment to his
printer some months back, but was still unable to secure the necessary
permission for the production of his edition. Through the intervention
of Sirleto, the first sheets of the work were secured from the Master
of the Palace and the printing of these sheets was permitted to
proceed.[143]

A year later, another archbishop advises Sirleto that he has been
waiting for a year or more for the permission which had been promised
by the Pope for the publication of a work that had already been
examined three times, the last time by Sirleto himself, and passed upon
with approval. He had contracts in train for the publication of the
book in Venice as well as in Rome.[144]

The authors found it necessary to guard themselves not only against the
elimination from their text of sentences, paragraphs, or chapters which
were required for a complete and consistent narrative, but against
the risk of the interpolation of text of which they had themselves no
knowledge and which might, in its purport, be entirely contrary to
the purpose and spirit of the work. In May, 1575, Thomasso Thomai,
writing from Ravenna, complains that his history of Ravenna, which had
secured the approval of the bishop and of the local inquisitor, had,
before being brought into print, been marred by the interpolation of
certain paragraphs which were entirely contrary to the spirit and to
the character of the book. Fra Marco, Inquisitor of Venice, reported,
in response to an inquiry made by Sirleto, that the Roman inquisitor,
a person both learned and zealous, had found certain passages in the
book which appeared to him to be undesirable and had undertaken, in
place of eliminating these, to write further paragraphs correcting and
explaining them.




                              CHAPTER IX

                CENSORSHIP REGULATIONS, 1550–1591[145]

    1. Papal regulations concerning books, 1550–1591.
    2. Censorship regulations in Bavaria, 1561–1582.
    3. Censorship under Pius V and Gregory XIII, 1570–1585.


=1. Papal Regulations Concerning Books, 1550–1587.=--According to
the _Bulla Coenae_, all persons who, without permission of the pope,
read or possess copies of condemned books come under the penalty of
excommunication, without the requirement of any specific action of
the authorities. On this ground, the popes reserved to themselves the
exclusive right to grant dispensation for the reading of such books,
but this claim of the Curia was not always respected. Permits for the
examination of books classed as heretical were given at different
times by Charles V, Francis I, the Bishop of London, and others. Leo
X himself empowered Cardinal Wolsey to grant such permits, according
to his own judgment, to scholars engaged in preparing refutations of
the Lutheran heresies. Caraffa complained that, in Venice, copies of
certain condemned books were freely circulated and widely read.[146]
The Dominican Carranza, later Archbishop of Toledo, secured in 1539
from Paul III, as a result of some clever disputations held in Rome, a
dispensation for the reading of heretical books.

_1550, April._ _A Bull of Julius III_ revokes all dispensations at
that time outstanding for the use of heretical books, on the ground
that the privilege had been abused and had worked evil.[147] Bulls of
similar purport were issued by Paul IV in 1558, in connection with the
publication of his Index; by Pius IV in 1564 in connection with the
Index of Trent; by Paul V in 1612; by Gregory XV in 1623; by Urban VIII
in 1627.[148]

It is not surprising that with these difficulties placed in their
way, the scholars of the Church found themselves not infrequently at
a serious disadvantage in carrying on their controversies with its
heretical opponents. As an example of a number of similar utterances
may be cited the complaint of Girolamo Muzio, who had been actively
engaged in suppressing heresy in Northern Italy. He writes in November,
1550, to the commissary-general of the Inquisition that his work was
seriously hampered for want of the privilege of examining the texts of
the heresies he was refuting. In March, 1551, the dispensation, for
which he had made various applications, was finally granted.

_1551, June._ _A Brief of Julius III_ grants permission to the
cardinals named as presidents of the Council of Trent to read the works
condemned as heretical, and through personal converse with Protestants,
to secure the fullest possible acquaintance with the grounds of their
heresies.

_1561, March._ _A Brief of Pius IV_ gives to the legates at Trent a
dispensation identical with that given by Julius III.[149] The letter
to the individual legate specifies that the permission to examine
heretical literature is granted on the ground of the Pope’s confidence
in the strength of his piety and faith and in the trustworthiness
of his scholarship. Similar dispensations were given to the Spanish
delegates at Trent by the King of Spain.

_In 1568_, _Pius V_ sends Cardinal Comendon, with two bishops, to
Germany to oppose the spread of Lutheran doctrines. They were charged
to purify the German dioceses from heretical books, “which are
perpetual instructors and solicit without intermission.” They were
instructed further to engage learned men to write against the heretics
and to print these orthodox and devout arguments in small books, which
being sold at a low price or distributed without charge, should come
into the hands of all. Pius promised to provide the funds required for
this “missionary” publishing. This method of influencing the public
had evidently been suggested by the enormous success of the Protestant
presses of Wittenberg.

_1587._ _Sixtus V_ issues a Bull for the regulation of libraries in
which is restated the penalty of the excommunication _latae sententiae_.

_1591._ _Clement VIII_ (in the _Instructio_ of his Index) authorises
the bishop to grant such dispensations to trustworthy and faithful
scholars, but for no periods exceeding three years.


2. Censorship Regulations in Bavaria, 1561–1582.

_1561._ _Duke Albrecht V_ appoints the first commission of censorship,
putting at its head two Jesuits, Peltanus and Canisius.

_1562._ _Duke Albrecht_ orders the destruction of all pernicious and
misleading books and pamphlets. The commission is directed to take the
responsibility of determining which these are.

_1565._ _Duke Albrecht_ issues a general edict directing the
prohibition of all heretical writings, and forbidding the sale of
theological works in any but Catholic towns.[150]

_1566._ _The Ducal Commission of Censorship_ issues an _Index
librorum prohibitorum_, and also a general catalogue of books which
it is permitted to sell and to read within the duchy. The catalogue
is printed in Munich by Adam Berg. The lists are restricted almost
entirely to books on religion or theology. It is possibly the first
attempt to guide, by official selection and injunction, the religious
reading of a people.[151]

_1569._ _Duke Albrecht_ orders printed by Adam Berg, for the use of
the monasteries of Bavaria, a special edition of the Index of Trent,
to which is appended a list, compiled by his commission, of the books
which are commended for use in the monastery libraries,--_Index
selectissimum auctorum ex quibus integra bibliotheca constitui recte
potest_. The volume contains a brief, written by Chancellor Eck, in
which the heads of the monasteries are cautioned to purge and to
reshape their collections according to the instructions given by the
Tridentine Fathers. It is to be noted, however, that the list of works
recommended include a number of titles which these same Fathers had
condemned and prohibited. Certain further authors approved by the
Bavarian censors find place in either Class I or Class II of the later
Roman Indexes. In the same year, 1569, Berg prints, under authority of
the Duke, an ordinance prescribing the texts that are to be used in
the “Latin Schools” of the duchy, and presenting a list of Latin texts
the use of which is prohibited.

In 1569, the Duke commits to the Jesuits the task of purging the
ducal library from pernicious books. In the same year was instituted
a general inspection or investigation of conditions throughout the
duchy (_allgemeine Landesvisitation_), which continued for two
years. The inspectors were enjoined to give special attention to the
bookshops as well as to libraries, private as well as public, and
to see that all heretical, pernicious, and non-Catholic books were
eliminated and the copies destroyed. They were also to take measures
to stop the distribution of heretical and godless pamphlets and tracts
(_flügschriften_).[152]

_1580._ _Duke William V_ issues an edict directing the immediate
delivery to the pastors or magistrates of all copies of heretical
books. Persons in whose possession are found any copies of proscribed
books are to be so thoroughly punished that thousands shall profit by
their example. The effects of deceased persons are to be searched for
godless literature. No reading of prohibited books is permitted even to
ecclesiastics or magistrates.

_1582._ _Duke William_ confirms the authority given to the papal
Nuncio, Ninguarda, formerly Vicar-General for Germany of the
Dominicans, to issue an Index, which was printed at Munich. It contains
the text and the lists of the Index of Trent, and certain additional
titles of “heretical, pernicious, or suspicious books.” The greater
number of the books had come into print since 1564, but the Bavarian
compiler had found some three hundred objectionable authors of
earlier date who had escaped the attention of the Indexers of Trent.
The additions all find place in Class I. They possess some continued
importance as with hardly an exception they were later included in the
Index of Sixtus V. These three hundred names of pernicious authors,
all of whose writings are thus placed under condemnation, had been
taken by Ninguarda from the catalogue of the Frankfort Book-Fair, for
the years 1568–1581. The greater number were transcribed from the
divisions headed: _Protestantium Theologorum Scripta de rebus sacris_
and _Der Protestierenden Theologen Teutsche Schriften_, but there
are also citations from the divisions of history, philosophy, and
poetry. In this manner, the lists of the Roman Index have been made to
include, mingled in with the well-known names of the great teachers
of Protestant doctrine, the names of unknown authors whose writings
were of trifling importance and of no theological or controversial
significance. They might well have felt complimented at the distinction
of such an association. It was the case also that certain books
announced in these publishers’ catalogues never came into publication.
Their “authors” secured none the less the honour of a general
condemnation, in Class I, not only in the local Index of Munich, but
in the Sistine Index of Rome addressed to the whole Christian world.
The names are naturally, in the main, German and Swiss, but there are
a few French and English, such as de Loquis, Petrus Ramus, Beza, John
Parkhurst, Thomas Dranta (under the poets). The Duke gave orders that
copies of this Index must be placed in all monasteries and with all
priests, confessors, and deacons. The Nuncio gave authority to the
bishops to appoint commissaries charged with the work of carrying out
the regulations of the Index.[153]

In August, 1581, the Jesuit Peter Canisius wrote to Duke William,
referring with approval to the Index then in preparation, and adds the
recommendation that a _Censor Librorum_, to be appointed by the
Duke and the bishops, should be sent to Munich, Ingolstadt, Straubing,
Burghausen, and other places where annual fairs were held, to examine
the books offered for sale, and particularly those imported, and to
inspect all libraries, both public and private. They were to have
authority to confiscate and to destroy all copies of books condemned or
likely to prove pernicious.[154] He suggests further the desirability
of an Index published as a serial from year to year. This idea of
Canisius was, some twenty years later, carried out, though not in
Bavaria. From 1606 to about 1619 was published in Mayence a yearly
list, prepared for the use of booksellers in Catholic States, and
presenting titles selected from the annual catalogue of the Frankfort
Fair. The title was: _Index novus librorum imprimis Catholicorum
theologorum aliorumque celebrium auctorum quarumcunque facultatum et
linguarum, causas religionis tamen non tractantium ... pro Italia
ceterisque nationibus confectus_. The first issue includes a preface
from Leuchtius, _Sedis Apost. librorum revisor_, an authorisation
from Paul V, and a privilege from the emperor. The Index is devoted to
the titles of books the reading of which is permitted.[155]


3. Censorship under Pius V and Gregory XIII, 1570–1585.

_1570._ _Pius_ gives instructions for the preparation of a new _Index
expurgatorius_, but the plan was not carried out.

_1572._ _Gregory XIII_ issues a Bull directing the production of an
_Index expurgatorius_ on the lines of that published in Antwerp. The
work was, however, delayed so that it was not until 1590, five years
after Gregory’s death, that this Roman Index appeared.

During the reigns of both Pius and Gregory, however, attention was
given to the production of expurgated editions of the works of a number
of authors, such as Erasmus, Boccaccio, Polydorus, Vergilius, Zasius,
Harphius, etc. Under Pius, condemnation was ordered for the teachings
of Bajus, but this did not bring any new titles into the Index.
In 1569, Guido Zanetti de Fano was put under arrest for heretical
teaching. The Senate of Venice demanded that the trial should take
place in Venice. The Pope Pius replied that the civil authorities had
no proper concern with matters of heresy, except to carry out in due
course the verdicts or judgments given by the Church.[156]

_In 1561_, _the Sorbonne_ placed under condemnation the writings of
Bishop Jean Monluc of Valence (charged with Calvinistic tendencies)
and resolved, against the protests of the Bishop and the Queen Regent,
to include his name in the Index; but after 1561, no further Index was
published by the Sorbonne. Monluc was condemned as a heretic by Paul IV
and by Pius V, but his writings do not find place in the Roman Index.
His sermons were, however, included in the Antwerp and Valdes Indexes
of 1559.

_In 1561_, a commission appointed by King Philip, under the authority
of Paul IV, took under consideration a series of thirty-one utterances
of Carranza, submitted by his opponents as evidence of his heresies.
The list was later increased to over one hundred by selections from
his confiscated papers. The report of the commission, apparently
not conclusive, was referred to the Council of Trent. Carranza had
published in Antwerp, in 1558, in a volume dedicated to King Philip,
_Commentaries on the Commandments, the Sacraments, and Faith and Good
Works_. The book was placed on the Valdes Index of 1559, but did
not find place in the Roman Index until forty years later.[157] The
author, after trial by the Spanish Inquisition, was imprisoned and
harshly treated, although the University of Alcala and a number of the
ecclesiastics of Spain, including the Archbishop of Granada, declared
the teachings of Carranza to be orthodox and valuable. The university
was, as a result of this utterance of the faculty, placed by Valdes
under excommunication, and subjected to a fine of twenty ducats. It
was forbidden to exercise any censorship over books except with the
approval of the Inquisition. In 1562, Pius IV, on the recommendation of
the Council, sent by a special nuncio to King Philip a brief directing
that the imprisoned Archbishop be delivered to Rome, together with
the records of his case. Philip declined to acknowledge the Pope’s
authority in the matter, and refused to permit the publication in
Spain of a brief so injurious to the dignity of his realm. The matter
continued to be discussed in the Council at Trent, and was also taken
up by the commission of the Index. The Archbishop of Prague was a
leader among those protesting against the arrogance of Spain in a
matter which concerned the welfare and the policy of the Church as a
whole. The treatise of Carranza did not find place in the Trent Index.
In 1566, Cardinal Ghislieri became Pope as Pius V. He demanded the
deposition of Valdes as Inquisitor-General and seconded the appointment
of Espinosa as coadjutor with authority to act separately. Camovani,
Bishop of Ascoli, was sent to Spain as Nuncio extraordinary with
instructions not to return without Carranza and the records of the
proceedings. In the brief given to the Nuncio, the Pope complains that
Carranza had now been in prison for seven years, and that specification
of the charges against him had never been sent to the Head of the
Church. The Pope ordered the Spanish Inquisition, under penalty of the
_excommunicatio latae_, to release Carranza without further delay. The
inquisitors were also directed to deliver the records to the Nuncio,
within three months’ time, or to send them in sealed packages to Rome
within three months. The penalty for disobedience was excommunication.
Carranza reached Rome in 1567. He was then again given the privilege of
confession but not of communion. The trial records were never delivered
complete. Those that reached Rome in November, 1568, and February,
1570, filled twenty-four folio volumes of 1000 to 1200 pages each. The
investigation of the business was assigned by the Pope to a commission
of seventeen. The translation from Spanish into Latin and reading
of the records consumed four years. Pius died in 1572, before the
commission had completed its work.

The Letters of Pius V, edited by F. Goubau, were printed in Antwerp
in 1640, under the title _Apostolicarum Pii Quinti Pont. Max.
Epistolarum Libri Quinque_. They are referred to by Mendham as
important in the evidence presented of the strenuous and unremitting
efforts of Pius to incite Charles IX and his mother to the extirpation
of heresy, efforts of which the Massacre of St. Bartholomew may be
considered as the chief result.

In April, 1576, eighteen years after the original accusation and arrest
of Carranza, the final judgment in his case (based upon the report of
the commission) was announced by Gregory XIII. Carranza was pronounced
to have laid himself open to the charge of heretical utterances
(_vehementer suspectus de haeresi_). He was ordered to disavow and
recant all heretical opinions, and particularly those expressed in
sixteen citations from his writings. He was then to be absolved from
further censure or condemnation. He was suspended for five years from
authority in his archbishopric, but was to be paid from its treasury
an annual stipend of one thousand ducats. He was to make his sojourn
in the Dominican monastery of Veyano. Carranza fulfilled the first
obligations of his sentence; but while preparing for his return
journey, he sickened and died, aged seventy-three years. He declared
with his last utterances that he had never held or taught heretical
doctrines. He accepted, however, without protest, the judgment of the
Pope; and forgave all his enemies. The statements which he was required
to recant specifically included:

“The Church of the present day does not possess the same measure of
authority that belonged to the early Church.”

“In the early Church, the Communion was administered in both forms.”

“The appointment of the bishop required an election by the clergy and
the approval of the people.”

“The election of the pope required the approval of the emperor.”

“Priests were permitted to marry.”

“Bishops excommunicated heretics but did not burn them,” etc.

_In 1566_, _Pius V_ appointed a commission of five cardinals, who
associated with them twelve scholars, for the preparation of a new
edition of the _Corpus Juris Canonici_. The commission bore the name of
_Congregatio de emendatione decreti Gratiani_, and came to be known as
_Correctores Romani_. The work appeared in 1582, with two briefs (1580,
1582) of Gregory XIII directing that this edition should thereafter be
the sole authority, and prohibiting the printing of it with notes or
interpretations.

_In 1570_, were printed revised editions of the Book of the Mass
and the Breviary. Pius issued a Bull forbidding, under penalty of
excommunication, the further printing of liturgies except with special
privilege. The Bull permitted, however, the reprinting and the use of
liturgies that had been used for not less than two hundred years. Of
the Breviary of Cologne, which belonged to this class, an edition was
printed in 1576, with a privilege from Gregory XIII.[158]

_In 1583_, the famous treatise of Scaliger, _De Emendatione Temporum_,
received the honour of a special condemnation from Gregory XIII.
Gregory had some years earlier authorised the publication, without
the name of the author, of an expurgated edition of the _Adagia_ of
Erasmus. In 1575, at the instance of the Congregation, Gregory ordered
that all works by heretical authors which had been authorised for
publication in expurgated editions should be printed without the names
of their authors.




                               CHAPTER X

             INDEXES OF THE NETHERLANDS, SPAIN, AND ITALY,
                               1569–1588


_1._ _1569._ _Antwerp._ Index, issued under the authority of an edict
of the king:

_Philippi II. Regis Catholici Edictum, de Librorum prohibitorum
Catalogo observando, una cum iis qui mandato Regiae Catholicae
Majestatis, et illustriss. Ducis Albani, consiliiq., Regii decreto,
prohibentur, suo quaeq. loco et ordine repositis._

This presents the Tridentine Index with certain titles interpolated,
and with some additional lists.

The decree of Philip makes reference to the _Taxae_ of the Church of
Rome. The wording is _Praxis et Taxa officinae poenitentiariae Papae_.
Mendham speaks of a monograph (of which he possessed a copy reprinted
from the Paris edition of 1520) entitled _Taxatio Papalis_, being an
account of the _Tax-book of the United Church and Court of Modern
Rome_, by Emancipatus. He states that Dr. Milner and other Catholic
writers had asserted that “this vile book had no existence but in the
imagination of heretics”; while Dr. Butler and others had taken the
ground that the work was simply a “record of fees of office.”[159]

_2._ _1570._ _Antwerp._ _Philip II and Duke of Alva._ This is a reprint
of the Index of 1569, with the exception that the Tridentine lists are
given without interpolations. The lists following are the same as those
of the previous year. After the edict of the King, printed in French,
Flemish, and Latin, follow the words: _cum Appendice in Belgio ex
mandato Regiae Cathol. Majestatis confecta_. The wording of the edict,
which bears date February, 1564, emphasises the claim of the King that
all censorship should emanate from his own authority. The execution of
the edict is committed to the Duke of Alva and then to the governors of
each province. The most essential provision is that within three months
after the publication of the statute, all the condemned books should
be burned, and possession of copies should, therefore, be unlawful.
The responsibility for the compilation rests with Arius Montanus, the
scholar who had edited the great polyglot Bible, published by Plantin.

All books partially condemned or appointed to be expurgated were to
be brought to the magistrate of the place and corrected according to
the judgment of the council. The usual penalties are added. The lists
include titles in Latin, in French, in Flemish, and in Spanish. This
Index includes the first index reference to the term _Taxae_, under the
words _Praxis et Taxa officinae poenitentiariae Papae_. A specification
of the application of the term _Taxa_ will be given later. The term
appears originally to have been used to denote the official fees
covering the cost of the censorship. Later, there was, however, some
extension of its purport.

One detail in this Index of 1570 is the including in it of the lists
of condemned Bibles and Testaments (with some additions) which had
appeared in the Roman Index of 1559 but which had for some reason been
omitted from the Tridentine Index.

The lists in this Antwerp appendix to the Trent Index were utilised
without change by Quiroga for the Spanish Index of 1571, and also
for the Index of Sixtus V. It is also stated in the edict that the
selection for condemnation of certain books which had escaped the
attention of the Tridentine compilers or which had been published
since 1564, had been arrived at through the labours of a commission of
learned and devout men, including certain bishops, inquisitors, deans,
and doctors, who had been selected by the Duke. Reusch points out,
however, that this scholarly commission could not have made a personal
examination of all the books recorded, as the lists include a number
of titles, copied from the catalogue of the Frankfort Book-Fair, of
books which had been announced but not yet printed, and some of which
never came into print.[160] This Antwerp Index is described as not
doing credit, in respect to bibliographical or typographical accuracy,
to the editor, Montanus, or to his learned associates. A number of the
authors in Class I are entered under both surname and forename; the
lists in all classes are characterised by repetitions and a variety of
inaccurate spelling. In this Index appears for the first time in Class
I the name of Stephanus, Robertus (the eldest son of Henry). Several
of his books, such as the _Thesaurus Linguae Graecae_, the edition of
the Psalms, the _Apology_ for Herodotus, had found place in previous
Indexes. In the Index of Benedict XIV, 1756, the name of Robertus
Stephanus is taken out of Class I, and the titles of the several books
condemned are for the first time correctly printed. Under the heading
_Duytschen Bücher_, are placed one or two English titles, including the
_Psalms of David, in Enghelsche metre_, by Thomas von Sternholde, Lond.
1559.

The Commentaries of Scaliger on Theophrastus, published in 1566, appear
in Class II. The schedule of prohibited Bibles and Testaments is in the
main a repetition of that of Louvain of 1550.

_3._ _1571._ _Antwerp._ _King Philip II and the Duke of Alva._

_Index Expurgatorius Librorum qui hoc saeculo prodierunt, vel
doctrinae non sanae erroribus inspersis, vel inutilis et offensivae
maladicentiae fellibus permixtis, juxta Sacrae Concilii Tridentini
Decretum, Philippi II. Regis Catholici, Jesu et auctoritate atque
Albani Ducis concilio ac ministerio in Belgia concinnatus, Anno MDLXXI
Antwerpiae ex officina Christophori Plantini, prototypographi Regii._

A “diploma” of the King then follows in Flemish. It expresses
deep concern for the endangered orthodoxy of the King’s subjects
and consideration also for their purses. On this ground, in place
of condemning to the flames all the bad books, it subjects to a
necessary purgation those which are corrigible. For the assistance
of the prelates authorised to conduct such purgation, an _Index
expurgatorius_ is provided. The Index was not to be published but
the bishops were instructed to secure the assistance of selected
booksellers in the different towns to whom, without the knowledge of
any others, copies of this Index were to be intrusted. They were to
communicate it to none but were enjoined themselves to discover in
the books in their hands the places marked for correction, to expunge
the condemned passages, or to cancel chapters or pages condemned
_in toto_. After the expunged copies had received the approbation
and the signature of the censor, the books were to be restored to
the dealers. Copies which had already come into the possession of
individual owners were to be delivered by them to the censors and
were to be handed to the booksellers for similar correction. The
introductory material closes with the following caution: _Cavetur
etiam ne quis hunc indicem parte aliqua augeat, vel minuat neve ex
impressis manuscriptum exprimate, citra gubernatoris et concilii
auctoritatem_. This caution is followed by a selection of the
Tridentine Rules and a general statement or explanation on the part of
Montanus, who is the responsible editor.

A conference was held at Brussels in May, 1570, for the purpose of
organising the work of revising the books to be expurgated. This
conference also gave consideration to certain books ordered for
correction by the Council of Trent, the list comprising chiefly
editions of the Fathers printed with “misleading and pernicious notes
and commentaries.” The Index, as finally prepared, was the work of a
board of editors which was presided over by Bishop Sonnius, and to
which Montanus was appointed as royal commissary (representative). The
Index was printed in July, 1571, with edicts of King Philip and Duke
Alva, and an introduction by Montanus. The cost of the work was borne
by the King. The original edition is very scarce, but reprints have
been issued by several of the Protestant publishers of Holland. It was
also included with the Index of Quiroga, printed at Toledo in 1571.

The edict orders, under various penalties for disobedience, the
delivery for correction of all existing copies of the books specified.
No further copies of the unexpurgated editions are to be printed,
sold, possessed, or read. New editions can be printed, under careful
supervision, with the authorised text as expurgated. In each diocese,
the bishop, or a representative appointed by the bishop, is to be
furnished with a copy of the Index, and to be charged with the
execution of its regulations. The copies of the Index must be read
by none but the authorities. The expurgated editions must carry the
notice of permission or of privilege. On the back of the title-page
of the Index is printed: _Ducis Albae jussu ac decreto cavetur, ne
quis praeter Prototypographum Regium hunc Indicem imprimat, neve ille
aut quis alius publice vel private vendat, aut citra ordinariorum
facultatem, aut permissionem habeat_. The schedule of books to be
corrected is classified under the terms _deleatur_, _mutetur_,
_corregatur_, _expurgetur_. The reports on the books examined are
grouped in the Index under the headings: _legi possunt_; _nihil
offendunt_; _nihil quia non legantur habere videntur_; _nullam
religionis facit mentionem_; _nihil offendiculi habent contra pietatem
vel bonos etiam mores_; _admissum est_; _totus liber rejiciatur ut est
in catalogo_ (Index of 1570); _tollendi sunt, quia correctionem non
admittunt_; _repurgatione dignum non censuimus_; etc.

Among the authors whose texts were largely expurgated under the
specifications given in this Index and in accordance with rules 2, 5, 8
of the Tridentine, were Gesner, Camerarius, Ramus, and Münster. Certain
others who had by the Tridentine compilers also been placed in Class I,
were, with but trifling eliminations, placed in the permitted class,
but still others were, without any correction at all, freed from the
ban.[161]

This Antwerp Index found but little acceptance in Rome, although
some of its material was later utilised by Brasichelli. In Spain, on
the other hand, it was accepted as authoritative and, as stated, was
made the basis of the Index issued in 1586, by Quiroga. The Spanish
Inquisition, however, extended and enlarged the expurgations, so that
while the work of the Antwerp editors is presented in a moderate
sized quarto, the Index of Sotomayor, issued in 1640, requires, for
practically the same list of authors, a portly folio.

In this Index was included the _Missa Latina_, with preface
by Illyricus, condemned on the ground of the preface and of what
are described as “offensive additions.” It was reprinted by Francis
Junius in 1586. The editor states in his preface that the expurgatory
correctors had not contented themselves with excising certain
statements that impressed them as erroneous, but had substituted
(as if part of the original text) other phrases, sentences, and
even paragraphs, making a sense entirely different from that of the
author.[162]

Montanus remarks naïvely in his introduction that many of the pious
authors of the expurgated books, who had died and who in the future
world had come to know the truth, would, if they could return to earth,
be very ready to be thankful to their censors. Especially would this be
true of those writers whose works as originally issued had been without
blemish, but the later editions of which had called for censorship to
eliminate pernicious notes and commentaries. Living authors might in
like manner have cause for gratitude to the censors, who had through
their labours rendered valuable and available books which otherwise it
would have been necessary to suppress; and, adds Montanus, certain
authors had written to express their appreciation of the service.

The larger part of the work of preparing the expurgated text came
upon the theological faculty of Louvain. In May, 1570, for instance,
the Louvain divines took up the task of correcting the notes and
comments of Erasmus on Irenaeus, Jerome, and Augustine. Their report
was presented in November of the same year. Later in the year, they
were engaged upon the complete works of Erasmus, a more serious
undertaking. The list of expurgations for Erasmus covers twenty-three
pages. Among the divines who took part in this work was Henry Boxhorn
who afterwards became a Protestant. The writings of Reuchlin and
Bertram were confided to the faculty of Douai. The latter gave special
trouble to the expurgators in connection with his book, _De Corpore
et Sanguine Domini_, which called for a full measure of analysis
and elimination. The critique upon this book takes the ground that,
“It was in order,” in judging of the ancient Catholics, “to bear
with many errors, to extenuate, excuse, and even by some ingenious
device to deny” (what the old author has affirmed) “and to fabricate a
convenient interpretation for any statements which could be objected
to in controversy as unsound.” Reusch speaks of the convenient form in
which the expurgated texts were presented by these Antwerp editors, who
in a number of cases printed in full (properly indicated by the type)
the sentences which were to be cancelled, while the Spanish editions
give of these sentences only the first and last words. A copy of the
Antwerp Index was submitted in due course by Duke Alva to the Pope,
Pius V. Montanus writes from Rome, in November, 1571, that the work
was not favourably received by the authorities, who inclined to the
opinion that the Antwerp editors had taken undue liberties with the
classification and conclusions arrived at by the Fathers of Trent.[163]

In 1572, Gregory XIII, in instructing the Congregation of the Index to
prepare a new Index, recalled any authorisations previously given to
faculties or other bodies for the expurgation of books. As a result,
the Index of Antwerp remains, excepting those prepared in Spain, and
the single one of the kind issued in Rome, the only expurgatory Index
in the series.

_4._ _1580._ _Parma._--_Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Apud Erasmum
Viotum. Parmae. 1580. Concessu Superiorum._

This Index was prepared as a supplement to, or continuation of, the
Index of Trent, and in accordance with the instructions given in the
Tridentine preface to bishops and to local inquisitors. The Indexes of
Liège, 1569, Antwerp, 1570, Lisbon, 1581, and Munich, 1582, were also
compiled as a result of these instructions of 1564; but this of Parma
is the only Italian example.

The lists, which contain 460 names, were undoubtedly utilised by
Sixtus V, in the preparation of his Index, as a number of the errors
in the names have been repeated verbatim. The Parma lists are full of
blunders, and the names of the authors and titles of the books are
curiously mixed together. The compilers have had access to certain
English material and have thought it important, for instance, to
include a condemnation of the Bible of Miles Coverdale, of which but
few copies could have been within reach of readers in Italy. The entry
reads: _Millo Couerdallus pro falsa translatione noui testamenti et
prologis in quaedam loca ejusdem_.

The works of some of the Fathers are included, which works it was
probably intended to condemn in some heretical edition, but the edition
not being specified, the condemnation covers the teachings of the
Father himself, as in the entry _Tertuliani Opera_.

At the close of the alphabetical schedule, is given a list (without
alphabetical arrangement) of twenty-one heretics. The list fails to
present certain of the assured heresiarchs, such as Luther, Calvin,
and Zwingli, but does include Melanchthon, Erasmus, and the Paris
publishers, Henri and Robert Estienne.

This Index of Parma had not been included in any of the earlier records
of censorship in Italy, and had even escaped the attention of the
indefatigable Vergerio. Its existence was unknown to Reusch in 1884,
at the time of the completion of his great history, and it is, as far
as I have been able to ascertain, not mentioned by any of the other
writers on censorship. A single copy was discovered in 1887 by Ludwig
Rosenthal, and, at his instance, a reprint, edited by Reusch, was
issued in Bonn in 1889.

_5._ _1581._ _Lisbon._ _Inquisitor-General._ In 1568, Cardinal Henry,
at that time Regent, published in Portugal the decree of the Council
of Trent. The Cardinal became King in 1578, and in that year he had
published a Portuguese version of the Trent Rules, together with
a newly compiled list of books prohibited for Portugal. According
to Reusch, no copies of this Portuguese Index are known. In 1581,
Portugal came under the rule of Philip II, and in that year, the
Inquisitor-General, Dalmeida, published a reprint of the Index of
Trent, together with a supplementary list of prohibited books. The
title reads:

_Index librorum ... comprobatus. Nunc recens de mandato Illust.
ac Rev. D. George Dalmeida, Metrop. Archiep. Olyssipon. totiusque
Lusitanicae ditionis Inquis. General. in luce editus. Addito etiam
altero Indice eorum Librorum qui in his Portugaliae Regnis prohibentur,
cum permultis aliis ad eandem Librorum prohibitionem spectantibus, ...
Olyssipone, excudebat Antonio Reberius._

The edict of the Inquisition announces the imposition of the penalty
of the _excommunicatio latae sententiae_ for any disobedience of the
regulations. The new lists comprise about 160 titles. A number of these
new titles became of more than local importance as they were taken over
by Quiroga and also by Sixtus V. The work of the Lisbon compilers was
in part based upon Valdes. Among the new names may be noted: Jerome
Cardan, Georgius Venetus, Crinitus and Amatus Lusitanus. Ariosto’s
_Orlando Furioso_, Bocardo’s _Orlando Imamorato_, and Dante’s _Divine
Comedy_ are grouped together in Class II. These three titles were,
however, not repeated by the compilers of Sixtus. The _Utopia_ of
Thomas More and the _Praise of Folly_ of Erasmus are placed together in
Class II. Quiroga, in repeating the _Utopia_, places it with books to
be permitted if corrected.

_6._ _1583._ _Madrid._ _Inquisitor-General Quiroga._ In 1583, the
Inquisitor-General Quiroga, on the strength of his apostolic authority,
orders the preparation of a new catalogue of prohibited books. The
edict states that, by reason of the great increase and wide circulation
of heresies, the catalogues heretofore published are no longer
sufficient. The Inquisition has therefore determined to prepare a new
and comprehensive list of books which have been condemned, and with
such lists to publish a series of general authoritative regulations
for the control of the printing and the reading of books. Quiroga
utilised for the compilation of the Index representatives of the three
universities and a number of other scholars. The regulations prohibit,
under the penalty of the _excommunicatio latae sententiae_, the reading
or the possession (either in bookshops or in private collections)
of the books specified, or of any books containing the pernicious
and heretical doctrines described in the general classification. To
the secretary of the Inquisition, as consideration for his labour in
the compilation of this Index, were assigned the “rights” for its
publication. It may well be doubted, however, whether this publishing
privilege brought to the secretary any very substantial return; as
excepting in the case of the Tridentine, no one of the series of
Indexes appears to have secured any remunerative sale.

The Quiroga Index contains no reference to that of Trent, but the
Tridentine lists were largely utilised in its compilation, and the
fourteen “rules” of Quiroga were evidently based upon the Ten Rules
formulated in 1564. In the Spanish rules, however, the authority of
the Inquisition is throughout substituted for that of bishops and
theological faculties. Books prohibited in one version are to be held
as prohibited in all versions, a modification repeated later by Clement
VIII. There is a general prohibition of issues in the vernacular of any
portions of the Scriptures. The largest schedule in Quiroga is that
of works in Latin, comprising fifty-seven pages. The other lists give
titles in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, Flemish, and German in
the order of importance specified. The lists of Valdes were in large
part repeated, and those of Antwerp and Lisbon were also drawn upon.
The Quiroga served in its turn as the basis for the Index of Sixtus V,
the next in order from Rome.

In connection with the introduction of a number of works by good
Catholics, the editors have addressed the following “Note to the
Reader”:

   “The prohibition of certain books bearing the names of writers
   well known throughout the Christian world as devout believers
   is not to be construed as a condemnation of the men themselves
   or as a charge that they have fallen from the true faith.
   In some cases heretical writings have falsely been issued
   under their names; in others, heretical publishers or editors
   have connected with the original text (in itself, orthodox)
   heretical notes, comments, or interpolations; and in yet others,
   writings addressed to scholars and suited only for scholarly
   understandings have been printed in the language of the common
   folk and circulated in such fashion as to cause mischief and
   error to unlearned believers, unskilled in matters of doctrine;
   and, finally, there are works which, while of service in the
   period in which they were issued and for the special purpose for
   which they were prepared, have fulfilled their mission and ought
   now to be withdrawn and cancelled.”

Among the authors whose names are connected with this note are Fisher
(Bishop of Rochester), More, Osorio, Luis de Granda, Cajetanus, Tapper,
etc.

Quiroga’s list of Italian writers includes the following entry:

_Petrarca, los sonetos siguentes, Del’ empia Babylonia, Otro Fiama
del ciel. Otro Fontana di dolore. Otro L’avara Babylonia._

Petrarch’s name does not appear in the Index of Paul IV or in that of
Pius IV. It is to be found in that of Sixtus V, 1590, but in subsequent
Roman Indexes it has been dropped. The later Spanish Indexes have
perpetuated, however, this condemnation of the Florentine poet.

The character of the criticism of the Church which Petrarch had
expressed in certain of these objectionable sonnets and which, while
extenuated by the Roman censors, had aroused the indignation of those
of Madrid, is indicated in the following lines:

    _Fontana di dolore, albergo d’ira,
    Scola d’errori; e tempio d’heresia,
    Gia Roma, hor Babilonia, falsa e ria,
    Per chi tanto si piagne, e si sospira._

_7._ _1584._ _Toledo._ _Quiroga._ _Index Librorum Expurgatorum._
The original is reported as exceedingly scarce. The work is known
through the reprint in Bonn, 1601, and that in Hanover, 1611. Mendham
reports[164] that the Earl of Essex brought to Thomas Bodley a copy
that he had secured, at the taking of Cadiz, from the library of Bishop
Osorius. This was the text utilised by Thomas James (first librarian
of the Bodleian) for the edition printed at Bonn. Llorente states[165]
that the work of compiling the Index was done by the Jesuit, Juan de
Mariana. The introduction states that the task has been undertaken as a
beginning and with the hope that it may serve as a suggestion to godly
and learned men to continue the all-important work of the purging of
literature; for there are many books calling for expurgation, because
on the one hand the heretics are always busying themselves with the
task of corrupting the writings of accepted authors; while on the
other, it is borne in mind that the heretics themselves have produced
works which can be made of service for science or for scholarship, when
they have been freed from pernicious passages or errors. Pains should,
therefore, be taken so to plan the necessary corrections that these can
be made with the smallest possible expenditure of labour or of money.

The thirteenth rule of the Quiroga Index of 1583 directs that any
heresies or errors that may be found in new books are at once to be
reported to the Inquisition, but that the reader must not take upon
himself the responsibility of cancelling the passages or of burning
the copies. The expurgation of the books whose titles are given in the
Index is to be undertaken only by those delegated by the Inquisition
for the purpose. The schedule of heresiarchs (chief heretics) contains
seventy-six names. The list was reduced by Sandoval to eighteen names.
These may be specified if only to indicate the basis of the Spanish
classification of heresy: Wyclif, Huss, Luther, Melanchthon, Zwingli,
Calvin, Beza, Carlstadt, Osiander, Brenz, Bucer, Oecolampadius, Servet
(Servetus), Stancarus, Pacimontanus, Schwenkfeld, Rotmann, Georgius. In
the Roman Indexes, only that of Sixtus presents a similar list.

Class I constitutes a large division in the Quiroga Index. The
compilers find deserving of condemnation the entire works of a number
of authors of whose writings only single books appear in the Tridentine
lists. It was probably less troublesome to put an author once for all
in the class of heretics than to incur the labour of examining all of
his productions.

In Class II, I may note the name of Theophrastus Paracelsus (1541)
connected with his _Libri tres Chirurgiae_. One of the three books
was permitted in the expurgated edition. In later Indexes, Paracelsus
is reproved because his writings contain so many magic and cabalistic
names which are hardly to be understood.

_8._ _1588._ _Naples._ _F. Gregorius Capucinus._ In 1588 was published
at Venice a handbook for confessors, prepared by F. Gregorius, a
Capucin monk. It bears the title: _Enchiridion Ecclesiasticum sive
Praeparatio pertinens ad Sacramentum Poenitentiae et Sacri Ordinis,
Editum a R. P. F. Gregorio Capucino Neapolitano uno ex Deputatis
Patribus pro Revisione Librorum in Civitate Neapolitana ... cum
Privilegio S. Fran. Inst. Regu. Fr. Min. Venetiis ... H. Polo
Typographo Venito imprimente_.

The volume possesses no official character, but is referred to by
Mendham[166] as important because of its references to forbidden and
expurgated books. Gregorius takes occasion to caution his readers
against the _Index expurgatorius_ of Quiroga as unsound, because
Quiroga fails to condemn the works of Molinaeus and Raymond Lullus, and
does not make sufficient excisions in the _Practica Papiensis_
of Petrus de Ferrariis. In the succeeding Spanish Indexes, we
find, as might be expected, a condemnation and prohibition of the
_Enchiridion_ of Gregorius.

This Naples Index is described as very scarce. A copy is, however,
contained in the Bodleian Library in Oxford.

The catalogue or Index forming the second division of the work
begins on page 146 under the title of _Libri Corrigendi_. The
preface to the catalogue makes clear its connection with the general
subject of the work. It begins as follows: _Quomodo Confessor
potest cognoscere, si poenitens tenetur ad aliquot placatum, ob
lectionem librorum, qui sunt a Catholicis editi, sed sunt infecti
et prohibiti ob interpositionem haereticorum, qui se interposuerunt
indictis libris, et aliorum qui sunt adnotati et prohibiti in Indice
Romano vel Tridentino.... Hoc potest cognosci ex sequenti lista; sed
est quaedam adnotatio, sive memoria edita, A. M. R. D. D. Johanne
Franciso Lombardo_, etc. _Post longum studium contra libros
haereticorum._

Capucino adds, after presenting his list:

   “Finally, avoid carefully a certain book entitled _Index
   of Books to be Expurgated_, printed at Madrid by Alphonso
   Gomez in the year 1584, since we must rather believe the
   statement false that it was printed in such a city and by the
   said Alphonso, and also the statement that it was printed and
   published by the body of the supreme Catholic senate. And
   among other erroneous or heretical passages contained in it is
   that which says that some of the works of Carolus Molinaeus, a
   heretic of the first class, may be permitted without correction.”

The editor was not successful in securing for this theory of
interpretation the approval of the Inquisition, and was himself, in
1590, brought to the stake at Salamanca as a heretic. Llorente[167]
states that at the same _auto da fe_, Torquemada caused to be
burned many Hebrew Bibles and six thousand other volumes.




                              CHAPTER XI

_1._ _1590, Sixtus V._ _Index Prohibitorius et Expurgatorius._ In
August, 1588, Sixtus V instructs the Congregation of the Index to
prepare a new edition of the Index of Trent. The work was completed
within two years and was printed in July, 1590, by Paul Bladus. This
is the first Index the compilation of which was carried out by the
Congregation. It is issued in the form of a Bull with the following
title:

_Bulla Smi. D. N. Sixti Papae V. Emendationis indicis cum suis
Regulis super librorum prohibitione, expurgatione et revisione necnon
cum abrogatione caeterorum indicum hactenus editorum, et revocatione
facultatis edendorum, nisi ad praescriptam harum regularam normam._

The substance of the Bull may be summarised as follows: Bull of
the most revered Lord and Father, Pope Sixtus V, in regard to the
production of a revised Index, with which are given the Pope’s
regulations concerning the prohibition, expurgation, and revision
of books, together with the abrogation of the authority of Indexes
previously issued, and the revocation of the authority to print Index
regulations other than those herewith presented. The Bull makes
reference to the precedents for prohibitory censorship as having been
established by Gelasius I and Gregory IX. Reference is also made to
the establishment of the Congregation of the Index, by which this
responsibility is hereafter to be discharged.

To the annexed _Regulae_ are attached the “penalties” of Pius IV.
The Index is presented for universal acceptance as possessing final
authority, and the publication by individuals, universities, or other
institutions of Indexes, compiled without the specific approval of the
Holy See, is prohibited. The edict is exceptional in the history of
Indexes, and it is in order to cite its phraseology:

_Universos indices quacunque auctoritate etiam praedecessorum
nostrorum hucusque et ubilibet locorum editos, ad hunc nostrum indicem,
tanquam ad normam ab apostolica sede praescriptum, ex qua recte
sentiendi, credendi, docendique leges in omnem ecclesiam manare par
est, revocamus, et exteris quibuscunque sublatio, hunc tantum, et ejus
regulas ab omnibus personis, et sub poenis omnibus, quae in praedictis
Pii IIII literis exprimuntur, et quas praesenti decreto innovamus,
apostolica auctoritate tenore praesentium servari, praecipimus, et
mandamus._

The rules which follow, and which are to supersede those of Trent, are
twenty-two in number.

_Regula I_ (which is one of the new ordinances) reads: _Quicunque
sanctorum patrum libros, vel Scripta fidem, seu mores concernentia,
ab ecclesia hactenus recepta, non admiserunt, poenis a jure statutis
puniantur_. _Regula II: Quoniam vero iidem sancti doctores, vel quia
ante obortas haereses, vel quia, ut eas surgentes impugnarent, fidei
zelo accensi, quibusdam interdum locationibus usi sunt, quas postea
Dei ecclesia Spiritu sancto edocta rejecit, nemini posthac eas tenere,
aut eis uti liceat; sanctis vero ipsis doctoribus, quia non animo ab
ecclesia Catholica, recedendi talia scripserunt, debita reverentia
deferatur._

The ninth rule forbids the circulation of innocent books by heretical
writers unless the names of the authors are expunged. The sixteenth
restrains the circulation of manuscripts. The nineteenth limits the
printing of sacred and ecclesiastical books to cities where the aid
of an inquisitor may be had; and the books printed must be conformed
to the exemplar in the Vatican. The twentieth directs visitations of
booksellers’ shops, and forbids private persons to burn proscribed
books, ordering them to deliver such to the master of the sacred palace
or to the local inquisitor. The twenty-first prescribes the expurgation
of sacred or ecclesiastical books, such as the _Decretals_, etc.,
which have been corrupted by heretics. The twenty-second warns the
faithful that if they offend by reading or retaining the prohibited
books, they will incur a sentence of excommunication, from which
they can be absolved only by papal authority, except in the hour of
death, and then only upon giving evidence of true penitence. The rules
conclude with an instruction to booksellers to possess themselves of
the present authoritative Index in order that they may have no pretext
for ignorance. A similar instruction is given to all who concern
themselves with the reading or possession of books that they are to
possess and read this same Index.

Sixtus died a few weeks after the printing of his Index, and when but
few copies of the same had been sent out. Reusch states that (as was
the case with the Sistine edition of the Vulgate) no further copies
were distributed after the Pope’s death, and the copies which had
been sent out were, as far as possible, recalled and the edition was
destroyed. The copies of the original issue are, therefore, at this
time very scarce. In 1835, however, the Sistine Index was reprinted by
Mendham under the following title:

_Index librorum prohibitorum a Sixto V Papa, confectus et publicatus;
at vero a successoribus ejus in sede Romana suppressus. Edenta Joseph
Mendham, London, 1835._

The Index is classified in three divisions. The heading of the second
division does not, I believe, appear in any other published Index:
_Deinde adduntur nomina Catholicorum quorum libri aut auctoris
incuria, aut etiam impressoris negligentia, doctrinam non sanam, sed
suspectam, et bonorum morum offensivam continere videntur_.

It is to be noted that the possibility is admitted of the appearance
in the works of Catholic writers of doctrine that is unsound or that
is offensive to good morals. The right purpose or intention of such
writers may be protected under the term “appear” (_videntur_).

While the Index of Sixtus never came into general circulation, it
has importance in the series because its lists were utilised as the
foundation for the Index of Clement VIII. In 1591, the edition of the
Vulgate undertaken by Sixtus V came into consideration with Gregory
XIV. The Pope had been advised to condemn and prohibit the work, but
he finally decided to have it reprinted with the corrections and
eliminations thought necessary, with a preface explaining that in the
original issue, certain errors had found place, errors for which the
copyists and printers were responsible.

In the condemnation of the treatise of the Jesuit Bellarmin (on
the authority of the papacy) and of the _Reflectiones_ of the
Dominican Vittoria, Sixtus acted on his individual authority. The
Inquisition and the Congregation of the Index declined to condemn
either book. The Sistine is the only one of the papal Indexes that
contains a list of heresiarchs. The list is entitled: _Catalogus
Haeresiarcharum, Haeresum auctorum eorumque qui eas suscitarum
seu Haereticorum duces aut capita extiterunt, qui ad faciliorem
intelligentium quartae regulae hujus indicis apponitur_. The list
compiled by Quiroga has been utilised for this. Fifteen of Quiroga’s
heresiarchs have been omitted, and twenty new names are added. Among
the eliminations are Ochinus, Ramus, and Agrippa, and among the
additions are several Hussites and Anabaptists, and Marsilius of Padua.

The Dominican, Alfonsus Ciaconius, charged by the Congregation with
the task of defining an heresiarch, reported that those are to be so
classed who discover new heresies or who revive ancient errors, or who
present in heretical institutions a defence of heretical doctrines,
or who undertake in councils the defence of heretics. The name of
Ciaconius comes into record also in connection with the following
statement concerning the Inquisition:

   “The Roman and the Spanish Inquisition have the same purpose,
   the maintenance of the Catholic faith. It is to be borne in
   mind, however, that the former is the superior, the latter the
   subordinate body; the Roman is the mother, the Spanish the
   daughter; the Roman is to be likened to the Sun, the Spanish
   to the Moon dependent upon the Sun for its light. In the case
   in which the Roman Inquisition presents one conclusion and the
   Spanish another, the faithful churchman will be guided by the
   authority of Rome.”[168]

In Spain, the point of view is naturally different, and the Spanish
Inquisition has always claimed independence from the authority of Rome,
and has often refused to be bound by the regulations issued by the
Roman inquisitor-general.

Sixtus is the first Pope who undertook to retain for the exclusive
action of the Holy Chair, or of the Congregation working under papal
instructions, the authority for the production of Indexes, for the
prohibition of individual books, for the expurgation of books which
in a modified form it was considered important to preserve, and the
general supervision of the reading of the Church. Preceding popes had
accepted, if not without question at least without formal protest,
the claims made by the Inquisition or by the Crown of Spain, by the
Inquisition or by the universities of the Low Countries, by the
Inquisition of Portugal, and by the University of Paris, to produce
Indexes both prohibitory and expurgatory, to publish regulations
controlling the production and the use of books, and to institute
and to execute punishments for the breach of such regulations. The
injunctions of Sixtus, promptly recalled by his successor, seem to have
had practically no influence towards the prevention or the lessening
of such undertakings on the part of national or local authorities. The
successors of Sixtus wisely abandoned the attempt to retain for the
Holy Chair the exclusive control of this troublesome business.

Sixtus finds place among the authors of Class I for two hundred names,
practically doubling the list contained in the Tridentine Index. He
utilised, in making his additions, the catalogues of Quiroga, the
lexicon of Frisius, and the book-catalogue of the Frankfort Fair as
printed in the years 1583–87. The general copying of the names from
Frisius and from the Fair catalogues, has the result of bringing into
the Sistine lists a number of unimportant writers whose names would
otherwise hardly have been preserved, certain others whose books were
announced but never came into publication, and, finally, some good
Catholic authors, editions of whose writings happened to be brought
into print by Frankfort publishers whose imprints had previously
been associated with heresy. Among the orthodox ecclesiastics who
thus secured undeserved condemnation were Caspar Macer, Bishop of
Regensberg, and Andreas Critius, Archbishop of Poland.

Certain of the entries in the Index deserve separate attention. In the
list of books published appears the entry, Joannis Casae, _Poemata_.
This work appears in the Index of Paul IV. Its author is spoken of
by Mendham as “that infamous prelate.”[169] In the Index of Trent,
however, the prohibition was removed, Pius IV having apparently
concluded that the transgressor had done sufficient penance. Under the
authority of Sixtus, the prohibition was, as stated, renewed, but in
all subsequent Indexes the title is omitted. Another entry to be noted
is the following: Roberti Bellarmini, _Disputationes de Controversiis
Christianae Fidei adversus hujus temporis haereticos_. To this title
is affixed the note: _Nisi prius ex superioribus regulis recognitae
fuerint_. It is difficult to understand why the stalwart champion of
Roman orthodoxy should have been placed under the ban. It is Mendham’s
suggestion that in the third of the _Disputations_ in question,
which has to do with the power of the Roman pontiff, Bellarmin had
stated that power to be no more than indirect as to temporals. The
censure made necessary a public revocation and self-correction on the
part of the offender. After the death of the critical Sixtus, the
cardinal is said to have vented his resentment as follows: _Conceptis
verbis, quantum capio, quantum sapio, quantum intelligo, descendit ad
infernum_. The authority for this citation is Baxter’s _Safe Religion_,
in which is quoted the report of William Watson, an English priest, to
whom the utterance was made.[170]

The name of the Englishwoman Anne Askew finds place in Class I (entered
as Anna a Skeue), the only other woman thus honoured being Magdalena
Heymairin. In the Index of 1597, Anne’s name is entered A. S. Keuue,
which a conscientious reader, trying to avoid pernicious literature,
might also find difficulty in identifying. The Sistine compilers have
made a curious blunder in including in their lists the titles of a
number of university controversial dissertations, which had been
prepared for the defence of orthodox doctrine against the assaults of
certain heretical opponents. The Frankfort catalogue, in its entries
of the heretical treatises, had brought in the names of the orthodox
writers to whom these treatises were replies.

In a number of instances, the Sistine lists repeat in Class III,
without the names of the writers, the titles of books the authors of
which had already been condemned _in toto_ in Class I. It is
difficult to understand the ground for the insertion in Class III of
a long series of historical works which appear to have possessed no
theological or doctrinal character. The titles had been taken from the
Frankfort catalogues of the publishers Feyerabend and Wechel, probably
because these publishers had come into heretical repute in connection
with previous books.

The compilers had discovered the pernicious character of a monograph
by William Camden, published in London in 1584, under the patronage of
Lord Robert Cecil. Camden undertook to prove that there had been under
Elizabeth no persecution of the Catholics on the ground of their faith.
In the same group, finds place the title of the monograph by John Knox
(but the author’s name is not given) described as _Liber Contra
Regimen Feminarum_; the original English title, _The First Blast
of the Trumpet against the Monstruous Regiment and Empire of Women_,
is correctly printed for the first time in the Index of Benedict,
1758. The edition of the monograph that came into consideration with
the Sistine compilers had been printed in Geneva in 1558. The original
issue had been censured (under the directions of Queen Elizabeth)
by the Archbishop of Canterbury and in 1583 was condemned by the
University of Oxford. No sufficient cause appears for the prohibition
of the _Chronology_ of Gerard Mercator. In 1663, the famous atlas
of Mercator was placed on the prohibited list, a prohibition that was
confirmed by Benedict a century and a half later. It is possible that
the dedication to Queen Elizabeth of these two books may have worked
to their prejudice. The introduction to the treatise _De Mundi
Creatione_, which is printed with the atlas, contains some remarks
in regard to the six days’ work of creation which may have been thought
to be dangerous.

The historians are of opinion that succeeding popes, and the Church
itself, believed it to be essential for the interest of the Church to
suppress this erratic and exceptional production of Pope Sixtus, and
as far as any continued influence of the Index itself was concerned,
such a result was certainly secured. Hilgers takes the ground that
this Index, never having been published, is not to be classed as an
authentic utterance of the Church. There is a curious reference,
made in the Index published six years later by Clement VIII, to the
intention that had been formed by Sixtus for the preparation of an
Index and to the fact that he (Sixtus) had departed this life without
carrying this plan into execution. The words of Clement are as follows:
_Verum cum idem Sixtus, re minime absoluta, ab hominis excesserit:
Nos hoc tempore omnino perficiendum atque in lucem edendum duximus._

Gregoris Lati, the biographer of Pope Sixtus, describes the special
purpose of a printing-office instituted by him. The description is
thought to indicate that some considerable “purification” was at times
found advisable in the text of editions issued through the papal press:

_Non lungi della Libraria_ [the Vatican] _vi fece fabricare Sixto
una Stampa capacissima, acciò che i Libri corotti, e profanati dagli
Heretici, e pieni di gravissimi errori si emendassero e si reducissero
al primiero candore, ed alla prima puritá, e si rimettessero, alla loro
sincera verita, stampandosi, e publicandosi con migliore ordine, e
regola._[171]

_2._ _1596._ _Rome_, _Clement VIII_, _Index Prohibitorius_. In
April, 1592, within a few months after his accession, Clement gave
instructions to the Congregation for the production of a new Index.
As before mentioned, the Index of Sixtus had been cancelled and
withdrawn and the Clementine Index was intended to be used as a direct
continuation of that of Pius IV. The responsibility for the direction
of the new compilation came upon Bellarmin, who, as consultor of
the Congregation, had secured the papal disapproval of the work of
Sixtus. The title of the Clementine Index makes acknowledgment however
of the initiative taken by Sixtus. The title reads: _Index librorum
prohibitorum cum regulis confectis per Patres a Tridentina Synodo
delectos auctoritate Pii IIII primum editus postea vero a Sixto V
auctus et nunc demum S. D. N. Clementis PP. VIII jussu, recognitus &
publicatus. Instructione adjecta. De exequendae prohibitionis, dèque
sincere emendandi & imprimendi libros, ratione. Romae, apud Impressores
Camerales._ 1596.

The completed draft of the Index of Clement (probably in the form of
proof sheets) was placed in the Pope’s hands by the Cardinal of Ascoli
(the Dominican Bernerio) as early as July, 1593. Clement decided to
delay the publication in order to give opportunity for suggestions
and criticisms. Baronius submitted certain objections which secured
consideration.

The first of the briefs of Clement is simply a restraint on the right
of printing. The second, bearing date October 17, 1595, makes the usual
reference to Gelasius I as the founder of the Index, adds a credit
to Gregory IX, and then passes on to Pius IV. Then follows a minute
detail concerning the intention, described as having been executed only
in part, of Sixtus V. The remainder of the brief is taken up with a
specification of the work of Clement in completing the plan of Sixtus,
with the statement that Clement had commissioned a congregation of
cardinals who had been charged with the prohibition, expurgation, and
regulation of the impression of books. The wording of the reference
to the Congregation of the Index would give the impression that this
was here instituted for the first time. Catalani is authority for
the statement that the Congregation certainly existed under Gregory
XIII and probably as early as Pius IV. Mendham finds authority, as
previously stated, for crediting the Congregation to Sixtus V. The
brief of Clement is followed by the brief and preface of the Tridentine
edition, with the Ten Rules restored to their place by the suppression
of the Sistine two and twenty.

The Index of Clement bears to that of Sixtus a relation similar to
that borne by the Index of Pius IV to that of Paul IV; but a larger
portion of the Sistine lists was cancelled by the Clementine compilers.
The order of arrangement follows that of the Index of Trent, the new
names and new titles being brought in as appendices at the close of
each class, and as additions after each letter. The Ten Rules of Trent
are repeated with the addition of certain “observations” in regard to
translations of the Scriptures, works on astrology, the _Talmud_
and other Jewish writings. The most distinctive addition to the
regulations is an instruction placing in the hands of the bishop and
inquisitors (or in Rome in those of the _Magister S. Palatii_)
the responsibility for the prohibition or expurgation of books that
were already in print, and for the examination of writings for which a
printing license was issued. In the brief printed as an introduction,
the Pope confirms the powers, privileges, and instructions given by
Pius V, Gregory XIII, and Sixtus V to the _Magister S. Palatii_
and to the cardinals of the Congregation. The brief goes on to state
that in the case of any questions or controversies arising in regard to
the interpretation of the rules and regulations as supplemented, these
shall be passed upon by the Congregation, or in matters of special
moment shall be referred to the Pope.

The Index of Clement is the only papal Index which, before coming
into publication, secured the advantage of consideration from various
points of view and of a revision extending over three years. The
Venetian ambassador, writing in January and again in March, 1594,
makes reference to a number of protests that had been submitted, on
behalf of the scholars and publishers of Italy, in regard to the long
list of additions to the Index of Italian works. It would appear that
the Pope took a more liberal view of these Italian writings than that
expressed by the work of the Congregation. Baronius, writing in July,
1593, to Lipsius, reports that the Pope had found it necessary to
disapprove the lists as prepared, although these were already in print.
Bellarmin, writing late in the same year, explains that his other
duties had compelled him to be absent from many of the sittings of the
Congregation. He appears to desire to make clear that the errors of
judgment complained of did not belong to his responsibility.

In the schedules as finally approved, Clement omits from Class I, as
first shaped by Sixtus, fifteen names; the only one of these which
may be considered as of continuing interest is that of Paracelsus. The
additions to this class comprise twenty-five names. Among these are
included a number of Englishmen, such as Matthew Parker of Canterbury,
Matthew Hutton of York, William Fulke, and John Knewstub.

In Classes II and III, Clement has omitted (in the list as finally
revised) a number of astrological works which had been included by
Sixtus, a series of Italian poets and novelists, and a group of Spanish
titles taken from Quiroga. The few additions to Class II contain few
names of present note. Franciscus Patritius Nova, who held the chair of
philosophy at Ferrara, had in his lectures on the philosophy of Plato
given to Bellarmin and others ground for criticism. Franciscus had, in
a letter to Gregory XIV, strongly recommended that the philosophical
teachings of Aristotle should be excluded from all the schools of
Christendom, and that the Church should give its approval to the
doctrines of Plato (as interpreted in his own lectures).

The _Apologia_ of Davila, printed in Madrid in 1591, is the first
work of the Spanish Regalists (defenders of the authority of the State)
to find place in the Roman Index. Through the 17th century, the list of
the Spanish treatises of this school condemned by the Roman authorities
is a long one.

In Class III, have been added a number of treatises from the Low
Countries, from Germany, and from France, bearing on the relations
of Church and State. The list includes a _Gratulatio_ from
Switzerland to France for the accession of the most Christian King of
France and of Navarre, Henry IV.

The “Instruction” of Clement, which is included as an appendix to the
Rules of Trent, includes the following provisions:

[Sidenote: (I) Concerning the Prohibition of Books]

(1) All bishops and inquisitors are instructed to give orders that,
under heavy penalties for disobedience, their people must within a
limited period make delivery of all copies of the books condemned.

(2) The bishops and inquisitors (in Rome the _Magister S. Palatii_)
are authorised to give permission to men of assured holiness and
scholarship to retain, for a period not exceeding three years,
copies of the forbidden books. They bind themselves to report to the
authorities, in the books which are permitted _donec corrigatur_, such
passages as they may find to be heretical.

(3) Outside of Italy, the responsibility for the distribution of the
lists of heretical and immoral books rests with the bishops, the
inquisitors, and the universities. The instructions to the people in
regard to the reading or possession of such books are to be given
by the bishops and inquisitors. This instruction was for a time
interpreted as an authority given by the pope for the preparation of
local Indexes. In 1621, however, the Index Congregation issued an order
prohibiting the further production of any such local lists, or the
further circulation of the lists already in print.

(4) The nuncios and legates in foreign lands, and in Italy the bishops
and inquisitors, are to submit annually to the Curia or to the
Index Congregation lists of the books published in their respective
territories, which in their judgment call for expurgation or are
deserving of condemnation.

[Sidenote: (II) Concerning the Correction of Books]

(1) The responsibility for the expurgation of books in accordance
with the principles laid down in this Index rests with the bishops
and inquisitors, or, where there are no inquisitors, with the bishops
alone. They are instructed to secure for such work the service of two
or three scholarly and pious men.

(2) The expurgators are instructed to cancel passages from the
Scriptures which have been wrongly worded by heretical translators,
unless it may be that such passages have been cited simply for the
purpose of refutation; passages which give praise or commendation
to heretics or their writings; passages adverse to the freedom, the
immunity, and the jurisdiction of the Church; passages which undertake
to defend the tyranny of the State, or which give countenance to
theories adverse to the authority of ecclesiastical and Christian law.

(3) In the books of Catholics written after 1515, when the necessary
correction can be arrived at through the introduction or omission of
single words, this course shall be taken. If this is not practicable,
the entire passage or chapter must be cancelled.

(4) In the writings of the earlier Catholics, no alterations shall be
made except in the case of passages which have been inserted through
the malice of heretics or through the heedlessness of printers.

When the pernicious material appears to be of distinctive importance,
it will be well to order the production of a new and corrected edition
which shall take the place of the erroneous text. The essential purpose
to accomplish is the presentation, in clear and comprehensible form, of
the actual doctrine and original thought of the writer.

Mendham points out that, according to this rule, the correctors or
compilers of expurgatory indexes were apparently placed in a position
to assume a _fraus haereticorum_ whenever such assumption seemed
desirable for their purpose, and to amend the text accordingly.

The difficulty with which the papal authorities were here contending
had to do with the text of the earlier printed editions of the
writings of the Fathers of the Church, and of certain of the later
ecclesiastical writers. In preparing these editions for the press,
the more scholarly and careful of the printer-publishers, such as
the Stephani in Paris, Froben in Basel, and Koberger in Nuremberg,
found it necessary to collate as many copies as could be secured of
the MSS. which had been accepted as more or less authoritative. In
certain cases, as for instance with the Stephani, the editorial work
was done by the publisher himself; while in others the service of
scholarly revisers was secured. It does not appear from the history or
correspondence of these publishers that they had any doctrinal purposes
in view. It seems to have been their wish, if only as a matter of
business importance, to secure for the printed book the most accurate
and complete text possible. There are not a few references in the
correspondence of their editors to the unsatisfactory condition of many
MS. texts, on the teachings of which had been based important matters
of doctrine or large contentions for ecclesiastical control. There
is at least fair ground for the belief that the so-called heretical
eliminations and corrections complained of by the Index authorities
represented simply the attempts of the best scholarship of the day
to correct the blunders and the wilful garblings of scribes (working
under ecclesiastical direction) who had prepared the accepted MSS.
presenting the teachings of the earlier leaders of the Church.

(5) When publication has been made by the bishop and inquisitor of
a _Codex expurgatorius_, the owners of the books concerned are
permitted, under an authorisation from such bishop, etc., themselves to
make in their own copies the corrections required by the Index. Reusch
points out that permission for such individual correction was never
granted under the regulations of the Spanish Inquisition.

[Sidenote: (III) Concerning the Printing of Books]

Each book must carry on its title-page specification of the full
name and nationality of the author and of the printer, and of the
location of the printing-office. In an exceptional case, the bishop
and inquisitor have authority to permit the anonymous publication of
a work, but the name of author and of printer, with their respective
addresses, must be duly recorded. Before the printer is permitted to
bring his volume into type, he is required to submit to bishop and to
inquisitor the complete text of the same, and, after this has been
examined, to secure the necessary permit or privilege. The application
of this regulation varied materially in different districts, but
the methods adopted frequently brought upon the printer-publisher
so considerable an outlay as to render unprofitable an undertaking
otherwise promising. In connection with the increase in certain centres
of the number of books planned for publication, the examiners found an
increasing difficulty in keeping up with the labour of passing upon
each portion of the text before issuing the necessary permit. They
began to take the ground of refusing to trouble themselves with the
examination of MSS., and of insisting on having the completed texts
placed before them in the form of printed sheets. This necessitated
on the part of the printer the striking off of an entire edition in
advance of securing the privilege for its publication. In these earlier
stages of the work of printing, the making of plates was of course
unknown. The fonts of type were small and the “sheets” (comprising from
four to sixteen pages) had to be worked off, each by itself, in the
full number of impressions required, in order that the type might be
freed for the setting of the succeeding “sheets” or “signatures.” The
printer would laboriously strike off with his hand-press 250 or 350
impressions of four, eight, twelve, or sixteen pages, and only when
such impressions had been completed, would he have type available for
the setting of the next form. In the case, therefore, in which the
examiners decided that the book could be permitted publication only
after more or less serious changes and corrections, the outlay incurred
in producing this first set of sheets would be practically thrown away.

The printer-publishers and also the booksellers were required to
make oath from year to year that they would carry on their business
in full accord with the principles of the holy Catholic Church,
the decrees and rules of the Index, and the regulations of the
local bishops and inquisitors. In the case of the publication of an
authorised, expurgated edition of a work, which in its original form
had been condemned, the title-page is to carry a wording similar to
the following: _Bibliotheca ... a Conrado Gesnero Tigurino, damnato
auctores olim edita ac prohibita, nunc jussu superiorum expurgata et
permissa_.

A document, peculiar to this Index, is entitled _Observatio_. The
first comment is upon the fourth rule and denies that by this rule
any power is given to bishops, etc., to grant licenses to buy, read,
or retain Bibles, or any parts or summaries of the Scriptures, in
the vulgar language. This Observation is continued in the succeeding
papal Indexes up to that of Benedict XIV in 1756. In the later edition
of the Index of Benedict, which appeared in 1758, the instruction or
interpretation given by the Observation is naturally modified. The
third division of the Observation revokes the partial toleration of the
Talmudic and Cabalistic books, and the fourth forbids the circulation
in any other than the original language of the Hebrew ritual called
_Magazor_. The sixth enjoins in the matter of the prohibition of
books, that the names of the works condemned should be delivered to
the bishops and inquisitors and that license to read them should be
obtained for the same. The correction of books is to be committed to
learned and pious men and the circulation of the work where expurgated
and amended to the satisfaction of the examiners is permitted. The
correctors are to search for all utterances anti-Catholic or adverse to
the Church or in praise of heretics, as well as for such as are immoral
or as may be injurious to individuals. Catholic books issued after the
year 1515 are, if objectionable, to be corrected, but the works of the
ancients are to be corrected only in case errors have been introduced
by the fraud of heretics, etc.

The instruction in regard to the impression of books is as follows: The
work to be printed must first be shown to the bishop or inquisitor and
approved by either of them; when printed, the text must be compared
with the manuscript and verified as correct before permission can be
given for sale. Printers must be orthodox men and must bind themselves
by oath to deal faithfully and catholicly, and the more learned and
eminent of them must profess the creed of Pius IV. A work that has been
expurgated by the examiners must express that fact on its title-page.

The Index of Clement is distinctive in giving a much larger measure
of attention to theological works by Catholic writers than to the
writings of heretics. In this respect, it serves to mark a change of
policy on the part of the Church, which was beginning to recognise the
impracticability of controlling the character of the whole literary
output of the world, and to devote its supervision to the task of
keeping free from error books by Catholic writers which would be likely
to influence the faith of believers. The Clementine Index secured for
itself a wider distribution than had been given to any preceding Index
excepting that of Trent. Within two years after its promulgation,
editions were printed at Bologna, Perugia, Florence, Milan, Verona,
Venice, and Turin, and also at Prague, Lisbon, Liège, Cologne, Paris,
and Besançon. The publishers and booksellers of Venice found occasion
for complaint concerning a number of the entries and regulations in
this Index, and the Venetian Senate submitted on their behalf a strong
reclamation to the Pope. After a series of negotiations, the Pope gave
instructions for concession on the more important points at issue. In
1596, was published an _Interpretation of the Rules of the Index
of Clement VIII, in so far as these apply in the territory of ...
Venice_. The more important modifications are the following:

(1) The prohibited books and those for which expurgation has been
ordered can still be sold to those who have secured the necessary
permission from bishop or inquisitor. (2) When new editions are
prepared of volumes that have been prohibited _donec corrigatur_,
it is not required to send the copies to Rome. These can be passed
upon with the necessary corrections under the instructions of the
local bishop and inquisitor. (3) The printers are not required to
submit for examination the text in the form of printed sheets. The
work of examination and of correction can be completed with the text
of the MSS. as prepared for the typesetters. (4) On the back of
the title are to be printed, in connection with the record of the
permit or privilege, the names of the examiners who have approved the
text. (5) The booksellers are required to submit, on demand, to the
inquisitor a catalogue of the books contained in their stock in order
that the bookshops may be “cleansed” from old copies of prohibited
and pernicious works. (6) The authority given to local bishops and
inquisitors to prohibit books in addition to those that have been
placed on the Index must be understood to apply exclusively to works
opposing the true faith, and to volumes which have been brought into
print under false or forged permits. (7) The publishers and printers in
the territory of Venice are freed from the general requirement of an
annual oath. (8) The heirs to an estate are under requirement, within
three months of the turning over of an inheritance, to submit to the
inquisitor a list of all the books received; and these books are not to
be used until they have been passed upon and approved.

These concessions were accepted as satisfactory by the Senate, and
authorisation was then given for the printing and promulgation of the
Index in the territory of Venice. The influence of Paolo Sarpi in
maintaining for the Venetian Republic the right of independent action
in regard to censorship, and in refusing to accept as authoritative
a regulation from Rome until it had been made to conform to Venetian
requirements, was evidently still in force. After this _Concordat_
had been arrived at, a resolution was adopted by the Senate (and
appears to have been accepted by Rome) that thereafter no book
prohibition should be valid in Venetian territory until it had been
promulgated by the Venetian Inquisition.

Sarpi makes a criticism concerning Roman censorship methods which is in
substance as follows:

   “The Roman authorities prohibit, as corrupt, the text of many
   valuable works, particularly of the class that have to do with
   political science and the rights of States; they prohibit many
   books which have no relation to matters of theology or religion
   and which they are in fact not competent to understand; they
   contest the right of the Republic itself to prohibit pernicious
   books.”

In another passage Sarpi contends that the Roman _Index expurgatorius_
is especially faulty: “In these so-called expurgated editions, the
reader can no longer ascertain the purport of the author but has before
him simply the opinions of the Curia.”

_3._ _Supplements to the Clementine Index, 1597–1609._ In the decrees
of the half-century following the date of the publication of the Index
of 1596, a number of books are separately prohibited the authors of
which had already been placed in Class I. In a papal decree of 1623,
it is declared that all works published, after 1596, by writers who
had already been condemned under Class I were prohibited. A number of
books which had not been transferred by the editors of Clement from
the lists of Sixtus V were prohibited later, in part during Clement’s
life and in part by his successors. In the first decade of the 17th
century, a number of individual prohibitions were made of books
belonging to the 16th century, and some of which had been in print
for a quarter of a century, or more. An example of such a belated
prohibition is presented by the case of Bruno. Bruno’s earlier writings
were published in 1582, but his name does not occur in the Index of
Clement VIII. Bruno’s trial and condemnation took place in Rome, in
1600, and first in 1603 does the list of works prohibited include the
books and writings, of every class, of Giordani Bruno Nolani. Bruno
was born in 1548 at Nola and associated himself with the Dominicans.
Proceedings were taken against him as early as 1577 by the Inquisition
both at Naples and at Rome. He succeeded, however, in getting out of
Italy and remained absent until 1592. In this year he came under trial
with the Inquisition in Venice and, in 1593, was delivered by the
Venetian authorities to the Inquisition of Rome. He was in prison in
Rome until 1599, and in 1600 was condemned and burned as an apostate
and an unrepentant and stubborn heretic. During the trial, Bellarmin
served as counsel for the Inquisition.

Among the works condemned in the first of these supplements, is the
treatise written by King James I of England in defence of his oath of
fidelity or coronation oath. This _Apology_ of the King did not find
favour in Rome, and it was condemned by two successive decrees of the
master of the sacred palace in July and in September of 1609, the year
of its publication. The title of the condemned work begins: _Apologia
pro juramento fidelitatis ... vero ab ipso auctore serenissimo et
potentissimo Principe Jacobo_, etc. The book did not find place in
the Spanish Index of 1612, but secured attention, as specified, on
the part of the censors of Portugal. The title appears again among
the works prohibited in the Spanish Index of 1632, under the title of
_Jacobus Rex_ in the first class, and also in the second class under
the title of _Jacobus Angliae_. In the same year, the title finds place
in a Roman Index, where it is catalogued under the letter _A_. The
condemnation is repeated on the Index of 1664 and in those following.
In an examination held by the Parliamentary Committee on the State of
Ireland in April, 1825, one of the Catholic witnesses, the Reverend M.
O’Sullivan, deduces from these condemnations the conclusion that the
old-time papal doctrine of the fight of deposing Kings had not been
revoked.[172]

In 1609, was included in the lists of books prohibited an Italian
edition of the _Confession_ of Theodore Beza. The book had been printed
in 1559 in the original French, _Confession de la Foire Chrétienne_,
and the Italian version had appeared in 1566. Nearly half a century was
required before the pernicious character of the work had become clear
to the authorities of the Roman Inquisition.

_4._ _Continuations of Roman Indexes, 1624–1655._ The Index of Clement
VIII was reprinted from time to time with the original decrees and with
supplementary lists. Such reprints were issued in Rome in 1624, 1630,
and 1640.

In 1618, was printed in Bologna, under the title of _Syllabus seu
collectis librorum prohibitorum_, a list of the books prohibited since
1596. In 1619, Franciscus Magdalenus, Secretary of the Congregation,
printed in Rome, under the title, _Edictum librorum qui post Indicem
Clementis VIII prohibiti sunt_, a reissue of the Bologna _Syllabus_. In
1624, these lists were reissued in Milan, under the title of _Raccolta
de libri prohibiti_.

In 1632, Magdalenus issued in Rome, under the title, _Elenchus librorum
omnium tum in Tridentino Clementinoq. tum in aliis omnibus Sacrae
Indices Congregationis particularibus decretis hactenus prohibitorum_,
what appears to have been a freshly compiled Index. This _Elenchus_ of
Magdalenus was, in the same year, reprinted in Milan, with the omission
of the series of decrees; and in 1640, a second reprint, containing
additional lists, was issued in Rome. Mendham speaks of this _Elenchus_
as if it were a personal and unofficial undertaking[173]; but as Reusch
points out, it was issued with the approval and the authority of the
Congregation, although not printed in the official press.

In 1644, a second _Elenchus_ was printed in Rome, bearing no name
of compiler or of printer, which presented in alphabetical order a list
of books prohibited since 1596.

In 1655, a third _Elenchus_, bearing the name, as compiler, of Thomas
de Augustinis, was printed in Rome. It contains the titles of books
prohibited between 1636 and 1655, and constitutes a continuation of the
_Elenchus_ of 1632. In June, 1658, this _Elenchus_ was itself condemned
and prohibited by the Congregation, on the ground of its incompleteness
and lack of accuracy.[174] It is evident that the Congregation Index
authorities were requiring a higher standard of bibliographical work
than had heretofore been thought necessary.

In 1629, the Inquisition issued in Cologne a reprint of the Index of
Clement VIII with the titles of books prohibited under the edict of
February, 1627, interpolated in the alphabeted lists and indicated by
a †. The books prohibited (by edict) between the years 1601–1627 are
not included, and the lists are therefore incomplete. The Index thus
compiled was, however, reprinted, without corrections, in 1647 and
again in 1665.

In 1634, was put into print in Trent an edition of the Clementine
Index which includes two supplements (each under separate pagination)
presenting respectively the titles of prohibited books and the
edicts of condemnation, for the periods 1601–1630 and 1632–1634. The
title-page contains the imprint Rome and Trent, in order to make
clear the authoritative character of the publication. Later, further
supplementary lists were put into print to be bound in with the above.
The lists or Indexes above specified represent the prohibitions of the
Roman authorities.

In 1603, was published in Cracow, under the authority of Bishop
Maciciowski, a volume containing a reprint of the Clementine Index,
together with an _Index auctorum et librorum prohibitorum in Polonia
editorum_. This latter contains sixty-four titles connected with the
names of authors and eighteen anonymous works.

In 1617, Bishop Szyskowski published, in Cracow, an _Index auctorum
librorum haereticorum et prohibitorum_, containing about sixty-three
titles. These Polish Indexes represent books condemned under the
authority of the local bishops.

In 1627, Thomas James issued in Oxford an _Index Generalis_, which
he had compiled from the Indexes of Clement VIII and of von Sandoval.
At the close of the volume is given a list of authors whose works had
been listed for expurgation by Brasichelli, Quiroga, von Sandoval, and
in the Index of Antwerp. This compilation of James is of course not to
be included in the series of Indexes properly so called. Its purpose
was in fact to commend to the attention of scholarly readers in Oxford
and elsewhere the books which had been emphasised by the Church of Rome
as heretical and pernicious.

Fuller specification of this noteworthy undertaking of James is given
in a later chapter.

_5._ _1607._ _Brasichelli, Master of the Palace._ _Index
Expurgatorius.--Indices librorum expurgandorum in studiosorum gratiam
confecti. Tomus primus. In quo quinquaginta Auctorum Libri prae
caeteris desiderati emendantur, per F. Jo. Maria Brasichellen Sacri
Palatii Apostolici Magistrum in unum corpus redactus, et publicae
commoditati aeditus Romae ex typographia R. Cam. Apost. MDCVII
superiorum permissu._

This is the second _Index expurgatorius_ in the Roman series. The
compiler was the Dominican Guanzelli, from Brisighella near Faenza.
He calls himself on the title-page. Fr. Jo. Maria Brasichelli. He
had, since 1598, been the _Magister_ of the palace. Shortly after
the publication of his Index, he was appointed by Paul V, Bishop
of Polignani. He died in 1619, leaving his Index a fragment, only
the first volume having been completed. This volume was printed in
the printing-office of the Curia. A reprint appeared in Bergamo in
1608, which was within a year or two suppressed. A reprint was in
press at Antwerp, but was suppressed. Further reprints appeared
in Regensburg in 1723, in Altdorf in 1745, and in London in 1837.
Even the reprints are very scarce. A copy of the original issue is
contained in the Bodleian. The compiler says in his preface that the
expurgation of books belongs to the responsibility of his office, and
that he has, therefore, charged himself with the task of examining
certain books which have been condemned _donec corrigatur_, and has
done what was requisite, through the elimination of pernicious and
heretical passages, to render these works available for the use of
scholars and students. The number of such books is unfortunately very
large, and he has, therefore, selected for his labours those which
when properly corrected are likely to prove of the greatest service
for the scholarly public, _quosque sibi e manibus extorqueri gravius
ferre homines animadvertimus et quorum ut permitteretur facultas pene
quotidie a nobis efflagitabatur_.... The texts which were issued with
the corrections specified in his Index have been transferred from the
class of condemned to that of approved books.... His second volume is,
he reports, already in train.

The preface is followed by a reprint of the Trent Rules bearing upon
expurgation, and by the second division of the Instruction of Clement
VIII.

The issue of the first volume of Brasichelli’s work brought out a
series of remonstrances and criticisms which caused the rulers of
the Church to decide that the publication of expurgatory Indexes was
an unwise policy. Such Indexes were also, in the judgment of the
advisers of the Curia, not necessary as the instruction in the General
Index last issued had given to the agents appointed for the purpose,
full power of making quietly and with freedom from criticism such
corrections and expurgation as seemed to be required in books the main
text of which was deserving of preservation. With an expurgatory Index,
this difficult work had to be done openly and with an acceptance of
responsibility.

The Index presents, in alphabetical arrangement, fifty-one works. The
list includes four which were not in the Index of 1596, but which had
been condemned in two edicts of the _Magister_ of 1603 and 1605,
and three books of the Benedictine Montanus (the editor of the Polyglot
Bible issued in Antwerp by Plantin) which had never been condemned in
Rome.

Certain of the books selected, such as the writings of Molinaeus,
Venetus, and Nevizanus, had already been expurgated. Other authors
receiving attention are Cornarius and Fuchsius. Editions of Xenophon
are purged by the cancellation of the names of heretical editors, such
as Gesner, Pirckheimer, and Camerarius. These particular expurgations
are borrowed from the Antwerp Index of Quiroga and the same is the
case with the corrections in the text of Polydorus Vergilius and
of Didaeus Stella. The list includes further: Rhenanus, Vatablus,
Paracelsus, Serranus (for his edition of Plato), and Scaliger (for his
Theophrastus).

This Index of Brasichelli cannot be considered as a personal
undertaking, as the compiler states explicitly that his work has been
carried out by him in his official capacity. It appears, however, that
he had secured no specific instruction or authorisation, either from
the pope or from the Congregation, as, if such authority had been
given, the record of it would undoubtedly have been printed in the
volume. On the other hand, if the undertaking of Brasichelli had been
disapproved by the pope, he would hardly have secured his appointment
as bishop and there would probably have been some formal cancellation
of the Index. In place however of being formally withdrawn, the Index
appears to have been quietly suppressed, probably on the ground that
it could bring no credit to the Church. The second volume was never
completed. The most important piece of censorship contained in the
Index, the expurgation of the _Bibliotheca Patrum_, aroused no little
critical opposition on the part of the scholars. It was apparently
undertaken without adequate knowledge or scholarship.

The first name in the list of expurgated authors is that of Arias
Montanus. Montanus had himself borne the chief responsibility in the
production of the Index issued in Antwerp in 1546. He had been accepted
as an authority not only for sound scholarship, but for sound doctrine.
About six pages of the Roman Index are devoted to his writings, which
here suffer a castigation and mutilation similar to that formerly
inflicted by him on other authors.

Space is given (as in all the expurgatory Indexes) to the Bibles of
Robert Estienne. The longest and most important article in the volume
is that devoted to the _Bibliotheca SS. Patrum_ of La Bigne printed in
Paris in 1589. As an example of the class of correction found necessary
in the _Bibliotheca_ may be noted the correction of cancellation of
_Sanctus_ or _Sanctorum_ or _S. Divus_ or _D._ whenever such term is
applied to a personage not in the list of Roman saints or of Roman
martyrs. The words _Caute lege_ appear frequently in connection with
the text of La Bigne. On page 82, Clemens of Alexandria is degraded
from the rank of _Divus_. In the critique upon S. Peter Martyr, Bishop
of Alexandria, the censor denounces his commentator, Balsamon, as “a
Greek and a schismatic.” S. Chromatius is censored as condemning oaths
altogether. S. Ignatius is censored for his opinions respecting the
Lord’s Day. Leontius is censored for omitting the apocryphal books
in the canon. La Bigne is censored for ascribing the work _De Duabus
Naturis_ to Gelasius who became Pope. Jonas Aurelianensis is censored
for his testimony against image worship. Marcus the hermit is censored
for contending that the kingdom of heaven is not given as a reward
for our good works. For Paschasius the title of _Divus_ is ordered
to be expunged. He is further censored for describing as creation
the change of the elements. Photius, Bishop of Constantinople, is
condemned (very naturally) for representing his own see as the head
of all the churches. To the Spanish author, Emmanuel Sa, is given a
discipline or censorship covering twenty-eight pages. In the next
succeeding Spanish Index, Sa is acquitted of any false or erroneous
doctrine and his writings are held up to special approbation. It was
with the Roman criticism of Sa that originated a long series of issues
between the Index makers of Rome and those of Spain. Francis Duarenus
received a castigation, which he might fairly have expected, for his
work _Pro libertate Ecclesiae Gallicae_, in section 77 of which are
detailed the heavy exactions of the Papal See. Cardanus is condemned
for his _Eulogy_ of Edward VI. A condemnation is also brought in upon
Queen Elizabeth, the text for the same being a dedication to the Queen
prefixed to a London edition of _Plato_.

Polydorus Virgilius is subject to correction for his work _De Rerum
Inventoribus_. Among the passages cited for reprobation are those
assigning (on the authority of Bishop Fisher of Rochester) a very
recent origin to the doctrine of indulgences, with the suggestion that
the discovery of purgatory was a powerful cause for the demand for
indulgences. The censors also condemned the reference by Virgilius to
the second commandment as involving a criticism of the action of the
Church.

A reference to the Brasichelli Index is made by Paolo Sarpi.[175] He
finds in it evidence that in a large number of the writings in which
expurgation or alterations had been found necessary, the passages
objected to were those which defended the authority given by God to
the prince. Zobelius, in his _Notitia Indicis_, states that
Brasichelli was aided in his work by Thomas Malvenda, a Dominican.

In 1611, an edition of the Brasichelli Index was printed in Antwerp. A
year later, the Nuncio writes to the printer-publisher: “By the orders
of his Holiness, this Index has been suspended. As some months back
I placed in your hands, for printing, a copy of the original issue,
it is necessary for me now to write asking that you will not proceed
with this printing, or, in case the edition is already issued, that
you will take the necessary measures to recall and cancel the copies.”
It does not appear that the Nuncio expressed any readiness to make
good to the publisher the outlay that the latter had incurred with the
permission, and in fact at the request, of the representative of the
pope. Mendham is of opinion that the Brasichelli Index itself found
place among the books later condemned by the pope;[176] and in this
opinion he is supported by Zobel. Reusch takes the ground that this
Index had never been formally prohibited. He points out that the
word _suspendere_, used by the Nuncio, is the equivalent of a
condemnation _donec corrigatur_.[177] It appears that there was
later (1643) the intention in Rome to prepare an expurgated edition of
this _Index expurgatorius_, but this plan never took shape.

Brasichelli had excited the antagonism of the Carmelites, because, in
his correction of the eighth volume of the _Bibliotheca Patrum_,
he had denied the claim to saintship of Bishop John of Jerusalem
(a contemporary of Jerome), and had also denied that Bishop John
was responsible for the production of the volume _De Institutione
Monachi_. The anonymous author of this book describes himself as a
Carmelite, and gives the record of the institution of the Carmelite
Order; but Brasichelli is of opinion that in the 5th century there were
as yet no Carmelites.

The Jesuits, such as Reynaud, Poza and others, and the Spanish
ecclesiastics generally, were much dissatisfied with the expurgation of
the text of their author, Sa. In the later Spanish expurgatory Indexes,
while certain of the works corrected by Brasichelli were retained, the
expurgations of the texts were very much modified and lessened.

In connection with the expurgation of the _Bibliotheca Patrum_, a
question arose, concerning which there was later no little discussion,
as to whether it was in order to place in the Indexes, prohibitory or
expurgatory, the writings of the Fathers of the Church. In the later
Roman Indexes, including that compiled under the authority of Pius IX,
the _Bibliotheca_ (under the name of the editor, La Bigne) is
still included, without reference to the edition, under the heading
_d. c._ Reusch finds instance of but one actual prohibition of
patristic writings. The other references to these writings in the
Index have to do with the comments, notes, or alleged interpolations
of heretical editors. The Instruction of Clement VIII takes the ground
that no alterations are to be made in the text of the works of Catholic
writers produced before 1515, unless there is evidence that corruptions
have crept into the text through the work of heretical editors, or
through the carelessness of the printers.

The question has from time to time been raised by Protestant writers
whether the Catholic editors of the patristic writings put into print
in the 16th century had not, under the instructions or with the
knowledge of the authorities who had given their approval to these
editions, corrupted the original text for the support of certain
doctrines or contentions.[178] It is not surprising that such a
belief should have obtained, in connection with the readiness of many
theologians of the 16th century to take the ground that passages of
the Fathers which could not be made to fit in with their own doctrinal
views must represent interpolations or corruptions on the part of
the scribes, or of the editors or printers of the earlier editions.
Franciscus Junius relates that a reader for the Lyons printer,
Frelonius, had shown to him a proof sheet of an edition of St. Ambrose
on which the censors, two Franciscans, had made material changes from
the text of the manuscript copy.[179]

Mendham suggests, in connection with the expurgations of Brasichelli,
as the secret of pontifical logic that to say of a thing _non ipsa
vera_ and _quodammodo_ enables you to turn the most obstinate
substance and propositions into direct opposites.

The use for faithful Catholics of available editions of the Fathers had
been seriously interfered with by the regulations of the Index of 1559,
and even by the modifications of these in 1561. Hosius writes in 1565
to Cardinal Amulius[180] complaining that before Pius V the writings of
the Fathers had been brought into print not in Rome or other Catholic
cities, but chiefly in centres of heresy like Basel where the editors
corrupted the original text. He had tried to make purchase in Rome of
the works of Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, and Gregory, but had been told
by the booksellers that the only available editions were prohibited.
Such a complaint may be taken as an indication of the greater scholarly
enterprise and intellectual activity of the communities which had been
influenced by Protestantism.

The title-page of an edition of Augustine, printed in Venice in 1570,
contains a notice that the text has been carefully revised and freed
from all the corruptions and _scholia_ introduced into the
previous editions by Erasmus and other heretical and condemned writers.
Thomas James[181] points out that the edition of Gregory the Great
printed in Rome in 1585 contains no less than 1085 passages in which
the text varies from that of the authoritative manuscripts. Calandrini
speaks of 13,000 such variations. Reusch is, however, of opinion that
these charges of corruptions in Roman editions are exaggerated.[182]

_6._ _Expurgations in the Roman Index, 1624–1640._ The Roman Indexes,
with the exceptions of that of Brasichelli and the suppressed Index of
Sixtus, are classed as prohibitory only. It is the case, however, in
certain instances that in place of the term _donec corrigatur_ (usually
indicated simply by the letters _d. c._) is given a paragraph in which
is specified the material that is to be omitted and the omission of
which will leave the book in the list of those permitted. Such a
paragraph is, for instance, connected in several of the Roman Indexes
with the name Copernicus. Occasionally is connected with the entry of
the title and the letters _d. c._ a reference to an expurgated edition
published under the authority of the Congregation, the reading of which
is permitted. Among authors whose works the value of which is in this
way emphasised are Natalis, Bottero, Florentini, Garafalo, Scaramelli,
etc. In the case of certain other authors (nearly exclusively Italians)
the editors have taken the pains to specify in the Index itself the
ground for the prohibition.[183]

_7._ _1624–1661._ _Rome._ _Censorship Decrees._

_Index librorum post indicem Clementis VIII prohibitorum decreta
omnia hactenus edita._

_Romae, ex typographia Rev. Cam. Apost. MDCXXIV._

Each decree, emanating from the different authorities, is here given
separately and at length, thus presenting a convenient summary of the
sources from which originate the prohibitions and criticisms in the
Indexes. The series comprises edicts of the Inquisition, edicts of the
Congregation of the Index, edicts of the master of the sacred palace,
and decrees of the pope, and extends from the year 1601 to 1629. The
Index with which the series of edicts is printed as a sequel bears
date 1632. In a second edition, issued in 1640, the series of edicts
is brought down to 1637. The master of the sacred palace, whose name
appears in the first decrees issued by that official, was Brasichelli,
whose abortive _Index expurgatorius_ has already been referred to.
Four of the decrees issued by his successor, Lud. Ystella, in the years
1609 and 1610, were the subjects of severe animadversion on the part of
Fra Paolo Sarpi of Venice.

In the _Discorso_ concerning the Inquisition at Venice, printed
in 1638, Sarpi complains of an attempt on the part of the Papacy to
undermine and to violate the Concordat instituted in 1596 between
Rome and the Venetian Republic. In the Concordat, it is stipulated
that no other Index than the Clementine is to have force in Venice.
In the two decrees in question it is declared that the Indexes and
separate decrees issued since 1596 are to be “in force in all cities,
territories, and places, of whatsoever kingdom, nation, and people, and
are to have authority, in whatsoever way, even without publication, the
edicts should be made known.” Such a claim on the part of the Papacy
certainly appears to constitute an attempt to invalidate the conditions
of the Concordat and to give grounds for the criticisms of the intrepid
defender of the independence of the Republic.

The 66th decree (1644) is directed against the _Lettres Provinciales_
of Pascal; and makes a separate condemnation of each of the eighteen
letters. This author ought certainly to have remained in favour with
the Church. In number seventeen of these _Lettres Provinciales_ he
expresses himself thus: _Grâce à Dieu, je n’ai d’attaches sur la
terre qu’à la seule Église Catholique, Apostolique et Romaine, dans
laquelle je veux vivre et mourir, et dans la communion avec la Pape
son souverain chef, hors de laquelle je suis très persuadé qu’il n’y a
point de salut_. It would appear, however, as if some wave of Jesuitism
must have influenced Pope Innocent X at the time this condemnation was
issued. It may easily be understood that from the point of view of the
Jesuits, Pascal could hardly be considered a good Churchman.

Decree number seventy-seven, issued by Pope Alexander VII, January
12, 1661, states that some sons of perdition had arrived at such a
condition of madness as to turn the Roman missal into the vulgar tongue
of the French.

_1._ _1612._ _Madrid._ _Inquisitor-General Sandoval._ This Index,
comprising lists expurgatory as well as prohibitory, is the next in the
Spanish series to the Quiroga Index of 1584. The inquisitor-general
under whose authority it was compiled and issued was at the time both
Cardinal and Archbishop of Toledo. The title-page bears, in addition to
the name of the Spanish primate, the line _de consilio Supremi Senatus
Stae. Generalis Inquisitionis Hispaniarum_. The volume is one of
considerable compass; as printed in the first Madrid issue, it contains
744 pages, five of which are not folioed.

In 1614, an appendix with additional lists was printed as a separate
volume. This is called _Appendix prima_, but no later appendices
came into print. In 1619, the Index was reprinted in Geneva in an
edition which included, with the appendix, a polemical introduction
by Benedict Turretini. In 1628, this Geneva edition was reprinted in
Palermo under the instructions of the Inquisitor-General, Zapata. The
Index is prefaced by a brief of Paul V, the text of which follows the
lines of that contributed in 1559 by Paul IV to the Index of Valdes.
The Pope says (in substance) that he had learned that the permissions
in existence in the Spanish realm for the reading of prohibited books
had grown to be too numerous and that the results were pernicious. All
such permissions, whether emanating from the popes, from the local
bishops, or from any other authorities, were now cancelled, with
the exception of such permissions as might be given by the present
inquisitor-general to the devout scholars to whom had been confided
the task of the preparation of the present work. The penalty for
disobedience of this general prohibition was the _excommunicatio
latae sententiae_. Then follows an edict of the inquisitor-general
in which he states that the work has been undertaken by him under the
general Apostolic authority that he possesses as inquisitor-general
in the Spanish realms; and under the special instructions given to
him in the papal brief. The penalties specified in the regulations
are incurred by all persons who possess or who read copies of the
prohibited books. The penalties are not incurred in connection with
books entered under Class II, concerning which the censors give simply
a caution. Copies of such books are however to be submitted to the
authorities (in Spain usually the local inquisitors) in order that the
nature of the caution or correction may be duly specified.

The fourteen rules (based upon the Ten Rules of Trent) follow pretty
closely the text of the Rules of Quiroga. Rule X presents a general
prohibition of all anonymous books and of all books not bearing the
name of the printer, which have been issued since 1584.

Sandoval’s editors follow the Roman model in placing their lists under
three classes. Works which, condemned in their original form, are to
be permitted after an expurgation, are specified in the original list
with a star, and the titles are repeated in the second division, the
_Index expurgatorius_.

The second and third classes present in separate alphabets the
titles of Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, Flemish, and German
publications. In Class I, the only Spanish names are Constantino de la
Fuente and Joan Auentrote. In this class is placed also Erasmus, with
the memorandum that all of his writings are prohibited as printed in
the vernacular. A similar specification is made in connection with the
names, given in the same class, of Petrus Ramus and of Macchiavelli.

The chief editor of the Index presents, after the classified lists, a
“notice to the reader” in which he says:

   “The writings of authors who have been condemned, in so far
   as these do not have to do with matters of religion, can be
   made available for the use of the faithful through a thorough
   expurgation. Even in the writings of orthodox scholars, whose
   zeal and service in behalf of the Catholic religion deserve the
   highest praise, are to be found certain errors of statement
   and expressions liable to misconstruction, which, if left
   uncorrected, would be likely to work mischief. In other cases,
   writings of Christian authors, whose work was well-suited for
   the time and the special conditions under which they wrote,
   have in these later times come into controversy. The result of
   their consideration by the scholars of later date has been to
   show the necessity of some revision or reshaping of the earlier
   text, in order to prevent these works of repute from exerting
   an evil influence on later generations.” “The compilers of this
   Index have undertaken the expurgation of more than three hundred
   works, among which are included certain books that have secured
   a very wide circulation. Certain further important expurgations
   are in train, and in collaborating in such work, devout scholars
   can be of noteworthy service to the Inquisition.”

This _Index prohibitorius_ contains practically all the titles that
were given in the Index of Clement VIII, and such further titles as
were compiled by Quiroga. It includes further a number of the later
prohibitions. Class I, in particular, has been very largely added to,
the new names, chiefly German, aggregating nearly three hundred. The
list includes a number of insignificant authors whose writings have
been entirely lost sight of. In the expurgated texts, Sandoval utilised
to some extent the work of Brasichelli. The appendix presents an edict
dated August, 1614, certain modifications of the rules, additional
titles for the preliminary lists, and a series of expurgated texts.

Schneemann[184] points out that this Index of Sandoval was utilised by
the Dominicans, under the lead of Bañez, to bring into condemnation
a number of the books of the Molinists, including the works of
the Jesuit Molina himself. The Benedictine Curiel writes to the
inquisitor-general to point out that this use of the Index by Bañez
and his associate Summel was the result of a disgraceful intrigue
against Molina. Bañez had secured, in 1593, from the Inquisition,
an instruction to the Universities of Alcala and Salamanca for the
production of an Index, but, probably on account of the protest above
referred to, the work was never completed.

Sandoval’s editors evidently had before them the text of the Roman
decrees of 1603, but they appear to have made a rather arbitrary
selection of the authors the condemnation of whom they were prepared
to confirm. Among the better known names omitted from the Spanish
lists are Bruno, James I, William Barclay, and Roger Widdington. In
the Palermo reprint of the Sandoval Index are added the titles of
certain Sicilian authors. There is also included a specification that
references to Pope Joan must be cancelled from any volumes in which
they occur.

The following entries may be cited from the two lists:

_Gregorii Capuc. Enchirid. Eccles_: this stands for the Neapolitan
Index in which the suggestion had been printed that the Spanish _Index
expurgatorius_ might be a forgery. Henricus Stephanus and Johannus
Scapula find place, the former as usual for his issues of Bibles, and
the latter for some treatise not clearly specified. For the works of J.
A. Thuanus or de Thou, the entry states that the censure of the present
Index covers only the first eighty books of the history. It is not
clear whether the last fifty-eight books contained nothing to condemn
or simply had not been reached. Isaac Casaubon is reprobated at some
length.

Emmanuel Sa, freely censured by the Roman Index is here very lightly
corrected and excused. As previously pointed out, the conclusions of
the Spanish and Roman Indexes often clash and the framers of the former
are reprimanded by the writers of Rome for their presumption.[185]
Under Cajaten, are cited two sentences (taken from a work by an
orthodox Catholic, printed at Antwerp) which have been, according to
Mendham, altered to a directly opposite meaning. Mendham gives as
example of his statement the change of the word _mali_ into _divini_
and of _impia_ into _sancta_. The works of Athanasius are considered
in no less than three editions and large changes and “expurgations”
are made in the annotations. Examples of the “cancellations” are the
following:

_Adorari solius Dei esse._

_Imagines tollendas esse testimonia._

_Angeli non sunt adorandi._

_Justificatio fit per fidem._

_Contra meritum humanum pro gratia, abundanter disputatum._

_Sancti non sunt adorandi, non sunt invocandi._

_Scriptura sacra sufficit ad veritatem._

_Canonici libri soli legendi, et cur?_

_Canonici libri soli sunt fontes salutares._

_Gratia Christi nos salvat per fidem, non per bona opera._[186]

The text of S. Augustine is also handled at length. Among the
propositions condemned and cancelled is: _Quae de carne sua
manducanda Christus proposuit, spiritualiter sunt intelligenda_.
Erasmus receives the largest measure of attention, no less than eighty
pages being devoted to the condemnation of reprehensible passages.
The expurgators protest particularly at the contentions maintained by
Erasmus against the worship of saints, images, or creatures.

In St. Chrysostom, passages are condemned which assert that, (a) sins
are to be confessed to God, not to man; (b) that faith alone justifies;
(c) that grace is excluded if we are saved by works; (d) that images
are not to be adored; (e) that nothing is to be asserted without the
authority of Scripture, which is to be read by all and which, to all
who are willing to learn, is intelligible; (f) that after this life
nothing can assist or deliver.

The _Theatrum Vitae Humanae_, compiled by Theodore Zwinger, receives
as much analysis as is permitted by the space at the command of the
expurgators. The work itself is comprised in no less than twenty-nine
octavo volumes. The reference to it being with a note worded as
follows: “Since this work is in a great degree collected from the
writings of condemned authors, it is to be read with special caution.
The names of these authors are never to be cited or referred to
honourably; and, to guard against error in the case of any author of
whose condemnation the reader may have doubts, he must have recourse to
the schedule of the first class.”

Zwinger has found occasion in his list of popes to use for not a few,
descriptive epithets that are by no means honourable. Mendham remarks
that “no attainment of vice, and not even the taint of heresy has been
considered by the authorities of the Church to be of force sufficient
to bar the claim of the popes to doctrinal infallibility in matters of
faith and of morals.”[187]

The faithful student who might desire to utilise this expurgatory
Index as a guide for his own reading, or who might think it important
to verify the accuracy of the citations condemned as heretical, would
find difficulty in tracing these citations, as the expurgators have
not thought it desirable in a single instance to specify the page or
even the volume from which the alleged extract has been made. The
opportunity thus given for attributing heretical opinions to one author
or another is obvious. An article in the _Protestant Guardian_[188]
gives, as an example of the methods of these Madrid expurgators,
quotations from the corrections made in a treatise by Hernando de
Santiago, _Consideraciones sobre los Evangelios de la Quaresme_: “not
Abimelech, you mean Melchizedech; and where you speak of Pelagians you
certainly should say Socinians; books of chivalry should of course read
books of the Maccabees; on page 149, Persia should read Assyria, Anna,
the sister of Moses, is evidently an error for Miriam, while Tamar
should be changed to Dinah.”

A reprint was issued in Geneva, in 1619, by Turretin, professor of
divinity. The editor places on his title-page the following lines:

    _Indices huic libro nomen praefigitur apte;
    Nam proprio Sorices Indicis pereunt._

The allusion is to a line in Terence, _Eunuch._, Act V, scene 7,
_Egomet meo indicio, miser, quasi sorex, hodie perii_.[189]

_2._ _1617._ _Cracow Index Prohibitorius._--_Index Librorum
Prohibitorum; cum regulis et cum adjecta instructione de emendandis
imprimendisque libris et de exequenda prohibitione. Nunc in hac
editione congregationis cardinalium edictis aliquot, et librorum nuper
scandalose evulgatorum descriptione auctus. Cracoviae. 1617._ This
was issued under the instructions of Szykowski, Bishop of Cracow.
There had, it seems, been two previous editions, one initiated by
Macierowski, Bishop of Cracow, the other by Zamoyski, Bishop of
Chelmin. The above title is taken from Peignot.

_3._ _1624._ _Lisbon._ _The Inquisition._ _Prohibitorius et
Expurgatorius._

This Index, issued in July, 1624, under the authority of the
Inquisitor-General, Fernando Martius Mascarenhan, bears as its main
title the wording _Index auctorum damnatae memoriae, tum etiam
librorum, qui vel simpliciter, vel ad expurgationem usque prohibentur,
vel denique jam expurgatae permittentur_. As indicated by this
title, the Index is expurgatory as well as prohibitory. Part I presents
the lists of books prohibited in the Roman Indexes and decrees up to
the year 1610. The three classes are merged under a single alphabet.
Part II presents an _Index prohibitorius Lusitaniae_, in which
are summarised, under one alphabet for each language considered,
the several lists of the Portuguese prohibitions. These Portuguese
prohibitions follow very closely the lists of Sandoval. The rules,
based in substance upon the Ten of Trent, are here expanded into
fifteen.

The material in the expurgatory section is in larger part transcribed
from Sandoval. The Index of Trent had been printed in Portugal in 1581,
and that of Clement in 1597. The Portuguese historian Seabra takes the
ground that, under Philip IV, no Index could be published without the
authority of the King. Philip had, in Portugal as in Spain, maintained
a certain personal supervision of the censorship operations of the
Inquisition. Reusch is of opinion that any reprints of the Roman
Indexes must have secured the approval of the King. In 1623, the King
issued an order prohibiting the reprinting, without the authority of
the chamberlain of the palace, of any book which had originated outside
of Portugal. In 1633, this order was renewed, with the specification of
books bearing upon the authority of the State and the history of the
times.

In the edict which stands at the head of the Lisbon Index, the
inquisitor-general directs that copies of all books specified in the
prohibited lists shall, within thirty days, be delivered to the local
inquisitors, and further, that persons possessing copies of books
belonging to the general classes prohibited, or of books the texts of
which are ordered to be expurgated, must, within thirty days, deliver
lists of the same, and hold said books subject to instructions. The
penalty for disobedience is, as usual, excommunication.

In the prefatory note to the expurgatory Index, occurs the remark,
that the works of certain well-known writers which, by the editors of
previous Indexes, have been considered to require expurgation, have
here not been included because their errors have been so thoroughly
refuted in the schools and in other books that their influence need no
longer be dreaded, and there should be no present risk for thoughtful
readers. The list of later Catholic writers whose works are marked for
expurgation is larger than in any other Index. Attention has also been
given to a number of works in the class of belles-lettres which the
editors have undertaken to purge from obscenities. Finally, the Index
contains a series of works on astrology, the expurgation of which has
been undertaken with reference to the instructions given by Sixtus V in
a Bull issued in 1585 (forty years earlier.)

This is the first Index in which appears the title of the essay by King
James I of England, written in defence of his requirement for an oath
of fidelity. This title, which is entered under the letter A, is worded
as follows:

_Apologia pro juramento fidelitas, primum quidem anonymos, nunc vero
ab ipso auctore serenissimo et potentissimo Principo Jacobo, etc. Lond.
1609._

The work is again condemned in the Spanish Index of 1632, where it is
entered under J. Jacobus Rex. In the same year it finds place (this
time also under A) in the Roman Index, the _Elenchus Capsiferrei_,
from which it has been repeated into the later Indexes of Rome. The
continued condemnation of this treatise is of importance as evidence
of the papal doctrine (which appears never to have been revoked) of
the right of the pope to depose kings. The Reverend Mr. O’Sullivan, in
his testimony before the Parliamentary Committee of 1825, on the State
of Ireland, deduces this doctrine from the condemnation given by the
Church (in the Index) to the _Apologia_ of King James.[190]

_4._ _1628._ _Rome._ _Papal Decree._ This decree contains an article
entitled _Elucidarium Deiparae Auctore Joanne Baptista Poza_.

Poza replies in a caustic _Apologia_ in which he charges Brasichelli
with censuring the Fathers, and with an unwarranted condemnation of
Emmanuel Sa. This rebellious conduct was punished by the Decree of
September 9, 1632, making condemnation of all of the works of Poza.
This decree is reversed in a supplement to the Spanish Decree of 1640.
The obedient Catholic was therefore at liberty to read the works of
Poza and of Sa within the dominions of Spain, but in so doing in other
territory, he incurred excommunication.

_5._ _1632._ _Rome._ _Index Prohibitorius._--_Elenchus Librorum omnium
tum in Tridentino, Clementinoque Indice tum in aliis omnibus Sacrae
Indicis Congreg._{nis} particularibus Decretis hactenus prohibitorum:
Ordine uno Alphabetico, Per Fr. Franciscum Magdalenum Capsiferreum
Secretarium digestus. Romae._ MDCXXXII. _Ex Typog. Camerae Apostolicae
Superiorum permissu._

The dedication reads: _Urbano VIII. Pont. Opt. Max._

This Index is chiefly intended, as is indicated in the preface, to
facilitate reference by writing under one alphabet the divisions of the
original Indexes, and by giving surnames as well as Christian names.

_6._ _1632._ _Seville._ _Index Prohibitorius et Expurgatorius._--_Novus
Index Librorum Prohibitorum et Expurgatorum; editus auctoritate et
jussu Eminent.^{mi} ac Reverend.^{mi} D.D. Antonii Zapata, S.R.E.

Statu, etc. De Consilio Supremi Senatus S. Generalis Inquisitionis.
Hispali, ex typographico Francisci de Lyra._ AN. MDCXXXII.

The Inquisitor’s _Edict_ refers to the Apostolic Brief of Urban VIII as
the reason for the production of a new Index, and states further that
this comprises, in addition to the works of the later modern writers,
no less than 2500 works of ancient authors who had been overlooked by
those responsible for the preparation of previous Indexes. The usual
prohibitions follow, with the penalty of the greater excommunication.
The _Brief_ of the Pope is in line with that of Paul V. Terrified
at the abuse of existing licenses, the Pope revokes them all, very
emphatically:

_Revocamus, cassamus, irritamus et anullamus, ac veribus penitus
evacuamus et pro revocatis_, etc.

Authority is given to the cardinal presbyter to put into execution
the several decrees, and to call in, if necessary, the assistance of
the secular arm. The “Notice to the Reader” announces that in place
of prohibiting altogether, it has been thought best to permit, with
some necessary expurgation, the reading of certain works by heretics.
For convenience of reference, there is included in the work a general
index covering in one alphabet the titles in both the expurgatory and
prohibitory divisions. The volume is the most considerable in bulk of
the Indexes thus far put into print, comprising over a thousand pages.

One entry in the class of authors proscribed _in toto_ is rather
curious in its wording:

_Martinus Lutherus. Islebii natus in Saxonia, an. 1483. Praedicat
contra indulgentias 1517. Ab ordine Religioso et a Fide Catholica
Apostata, et Heresiarcha, 1517. Reperitur in lecto misere exanimis,
1546._

This passage did not make its appearance in any subsequent Index.

_7._ _1640._ _Madrid._ _Sotomayor._ In 1640, the Inquisitor-General
Antonio de Sotomayor (a Dominican) produced an Index, also printed in
Madrid, which contains both prohibitory and expurgatory divisions. An
edition of this Index, printed (without imprint) either at Lyons or
Geneva, secured a wide circulation. Sotomayor died in 1648, in his
hundredth year. His Index was reprinted in Madrid in 1662, and again
in 1667, under the name of his successor. The Spanish Index of 1707
refers, however, to that of 1640 as “the next preceding.”

Sotomayor’s introduction begins with a long declamation against
heretical writers who have ventured to issue, under the names of
Catholic authors, pernicious and damnable books; who have interpolated
into the text of orthodox writings heretical passages; who have
described as untrustworthy the writings of the Fathers of the Church
(for instance the treatise of Ambrosius on the Sacraments and the works
of Dionysius Areopagita); and who have destroyed great numbers of
pious books presenting good Catholic doctrine. The regulations which
follow are issued under the general Apostolic authority vested in the
inquisitor-general, and under the special authority given by the Brief
of the Holy Curia. All copies of works which are specifically condemned
by title, or which belong to the classes condemned _in toto_,
are to be delivered within ten days to the local inquisitor. Whoever
retains books classed as heretical, falls under the _excommunicatio
latae_. The retention of other prohibited books brings upon the
possessor the penalty of the _excommunicatio ferendae_. In either
case, there is a further penalty of a fine of six hundred ducats, and
such additional punishments as may be ordered by the Inquisition. The
power rests with the inquisitor-general alone of freeing delinquents
from these penalties.

The sixteen rules contain certain additions to the Regulations of
Trent. The writings of Catholics are, for instance, not to be condemned
on the ground of containing extracts from the works of heresiarchs
cited for the purpose of refutation. In the supervision of books for
the purpose of expurgation, care is to be taken not to cancel the names
of heresiarchs who are referred to by the authors in connection with
necessary refutations.

The rules and penalties are similar to those previously in force. The
supplement contains an entry permitting, after certain expurgations,
the reading of the works of Poza, which by the Roman Congregation had
been absolutely condemned.

As examples of the character of the expurgations which find place
in the Spanish Indexes may be cited the following: Sotomayor orders
the cancellation, in bibliographies or other works of reference, of
the following terms when applied to names of writers standing in
the general Index in Class I: _vir optimus, pius, bonae memoriae,
doctissimus sapientissimus, princeps eruditorum, divinus (Scaliger),
Germaniae lumen (Melanchthon), decus saeculi nostri, etc._ It
is however permitted to describe Buchanan as a “poet of elegance,”
Henricus Stephanus as “learned in Greek scholarship,” Tycho Brahe as “a
distinguished mathematician and astronomer”; because the attainments
so indicated are the gift of God and have not been utilised, at least
directly, against the true faith. The Spanish editor goes on to say,
that such titles as doctor and _magister_ can, strictly speaking,
properly be ascribed to no one outside of the Church; the reference
is to cases in which these titles have been given by heretical
universities whose authority is not recognised by the Church. The title
_Dominus_ can however be permitted.

The expurgatory lists of Sotomayor include the title of the _Vitae
Germanorum_ of Adams; the expurgations comprise thirteen folio
sheets. There are certain interpolations comprising such terms as
_notam auctoris damnati_ or _homo damnatae memoriae_, etc. In the
_Bibliographica critica_, of Michael Josephus, published in Madrid in
1740, the author says in his introduction:

   “In the specification of works of heretics I have taken pains
   to avoid using any terms of commendation; for it is certainly
   not right that infamous persons who have fallen away from the
   true Catholic faith should in any fashion be honoured. Certain
   Catholic writers have on the other hand contended that heretical
   authors whose work had been devoted to subjects outside of
   theology or religion, such for instance as philology, geography,
   profane history, jurisprudence, and the like, could very
   properly be commended for their contributions to learning. To
   this suggestion I should respond that I am prepared to recognise
   the possibility of heretics possessing learning and talents, and
   that certain heretics have written on certain subjects works
   which may be of use to Catholics; but it seems to me entirely
   improper to give any measure of praise to such men who have
   failed to use for the support of the true faith the abilities
   with which they have been endowed by the Lord. They can receive
   enough praise from their heretical friends and it would tend to
   make them intellectually insolent to learn that they had been
   honoured also by Catholics.”

in chronological order belongs at this point in the schedule, is
considered separately in Chapter XIII.

_9._ _1707._ _Madrid._ _Index Prohibitorius et Expurgatorius._

_Novissimus Librorum Prohibitorum et Expurgandorum Index pro
Catholicis Hispaniarum Regis Phillipi V Reg. Cath. Ann. 1707._

On the engraved title is printed, _Index Expurgatorius Hispanus ab
Ex^{mo} D^{no} Didace Sarmiento et Valladores inceptus, et ab Ill^o
D^{no} D. Vitali Marin perfectus, etc. De Consilio Supremi Senatus
Inquisitionis Generalis._

The work is contained in two volumes, the first comprising 791 pages
and the second 342 pages. It begins with the edict of the Bishop of
Ceuta, and Inquisitor-General, Don Vidal Marin, who explains that
he is completing the work of his predecessor Don Diego Sarmiento,
who had been interrupted in his labours by death. He writes that,
considering the importance and necessity of continuing the Spanish
Index of 1640, this Index has been prepared in order that the books and
pamphlets issued during the last sixty-seven years might, as far as
requisite, be prohibited or expurgated and that the faithful might thus
be preserved from the errors which would otherwise have been caused
through the circulation of heretical or erroneous texts. The previous
_Advertencias_ and _Mandatos_ are repeated and are ordered to
be enforced with the utmost rigour of the law. Provision is made for
the publication of the Index in all churches, cathedrals, colleges, and
cities.

An _avis_ of the Privy Council of Brussels, printed in 1708,
contains the following naïve remark in regard to this Index: _Et pour
montrer qu’il est très difficile d’examiner les livres et de discerner
s’ils doivent être condamnés ou pas, on n’a que prendre recours a
l’Index Expurgatorius d’Espagne, émané dernièrement en l’an 1707, ou
se trouvent plusieurs livres approuvés que Rome a condamné, et de même
plusieurs condamnés par les Inquisiteurs que la Ste. Congregation n’a
pas trouvé convenir de proscrire_.

_10._ _1714._ _Namur and Liège._ _Hannot._--_Index ou Catalogues des
principaux Livres condamnés, rédigé par Jean Baptiste Hannot, Recollet,
Lecteur en Théologie._

This Index, while issued _avec approbation_, was compiled without any
specific authority. It comprises a selection, arrived at apparently in
a rather haphazard fashion, of works favouring Jansenism.

_11._ _1747._ _Madrid._ _Prado. 2 vols. 1200 pp. Pro. and Ex._ This
Index is noteworthy for its _Catalogo_ of Jansenist books. The list
originally included the _History of Pelagianism_ by Cardinal Noris,
but this entry was, as Mendham points out, subsequently cancelled by
the reprinting of a leaf.[191] The cancellation was the result of a
protest or remonstrance addressed by the Pope (Benedict XIV) to the
Inquisitor-General, Compostolla. The brief of Benedict is given in
a supplement to the _Bullarium_ of that Pope, and is cited from the
edition printed in Mechlin, in 1827. The Pope reminds the inquisitor
that it is the policy of the Church to exercise censorship with
moderation and conservatism. He refers to the treatise of Bossuet,
published under the commands of the King of France, which was written
in direct hostility to the infallibility of the Pope and to his claim
for authority over the temporal rights of princes; and he reminds the
inquisitor that his predecessor had decided that the interest of the
Church would be better served by forbearing.

_12._ _1790._ _Madrid._ _Index Prohibitorius et
Expurgatorius._--_Indici Ultimo de los libros prohibidos y mandados
expurgar; para todos los Regnos y Señorios del Catolico Rey de las
Españas el Señor Dom. Carlos IV._ The work contains the prefatory
matter of the three preceding editions, and brings the lists of
condemned and expurgated books down to the close of December, 1789.
The Inquisitor-General, Cevallos, under whose supervision the work was
prepared, declares, as the purpose of the Index, the presentation of
an alphabetic compendium which should comprehend not only the contents
of the Index of 1747, but likewise the titles of all works which had
been prohibited or sentenced to expurgation in the edicts previously
cited up to December 13, 1789. “This would,” he believed, “serve to
close the door to the excesses of printers and booksellers and also
to wrongful action on the part of private persons, and would prevent
the evils consequent upon the introduction into the Kingdom of such
pernicious commodities as heretical books.”

The Index is noteworthy in expressing the change of policy in regard
to the reading of the Scriptures. The inquisitor and his associates
profess themselves to be sensible of the benefits to be secured by
the faithful from the perusal of the Sacred Text, and with reference
to the declaration to the same purpose in the Index of Benedict XIV
(which declaration is printed in the present volume) they decide to
accord permission for the reading of versions of the Bible in the
vulgar tongue, with qualifications similar to those specified in the
Benedictine Index. The longer expurgations of the earlier Indexes are
not reprinted, but a reference is made, connected with the name of the
author, to the Index in which the expurgation originated. For instance:

“Abailardus (Petrus) _ejus opera_ V. Ind. Exp. 1747, p. 920.”

With reference to these condensed entries, the Index of 1790 is often
referred to as an Index manual. To the twelfth rule (in the series
of sixteen) is added the instruction that the possessor of a book
ordered to be expurgated is at liberty himself to make the necessary
corrections in the text, provided, however, that his corrected text
shall, within two months’ time, be submitted to and approved by the
local inquisitor.

Reusch points out that these Spanish Indexes, even the latest, contain
many more errors, both bibliographical and typographical, than those
of the Roman series before Benedict. The compilers of the Index of
Cevallos were of course in a position to utilise in their work the
lists and the information brought together in the Index of Benedict.
It would appear, however, that they made no use of the Benedictine
Index, while it is evident that the compilers were in many cases quite
ignorant of even the names of the authors and of the books condemned
(not to speak of the contents). The following entry may be cited as an
example of some likely to cause perplexity to the devout reader:

“Fulko Grevil, Theliffe Of the Renovudne, Senior Phillip Ciduaey” (Fulk
Greville’s _Life of the Renowned Sir Philip Sidney_).

_13._ _Supplements to the Spanish Index of 1790._ The second
issue of the Index of 1790 contains two supplements which present the
titles of certain books that, during the printing of the Index, came
under the condemnation of the Inquisition. The works belong almost
exclusively to a group of writings having to do with the French
Revolution. In 1805, was printed a third supplement that contains books
prohibited between 1789 and 1805. This list includes, in addition to
writings of the Revolution, certain Italian works that had during
the preceding decade been prohibited in Rome. Between the years 1806
and 1819 (years that covered the period of the French invasion, the
short-lived kingdom of Joseph, and the reorganisation of the kingdom),
the Inquisition published seven edicts in which a number of works were
prohibited. These lists were, however, not combined into any official
Index. In 1844, was printed in Madrid an Index in which were combined
into one alphabet the lists of the Index of 1790, the supplement of
1805, and the lists of the Mechlin edition of the Roman Index of 1843.
This publication was, however, a private and unofficial undertaking.
In 1848, was printed in Madrid an appendix to the Index of 1844, which
contains the titles of the books prohibited by the Inquisition between
1805 and 1819 together with the titles of the books prohibited in Rome
between 1842 and 1846. In 1863, was issued in Madrid a second appendix
giving the titles of the books prohibited in Rome between 1846 and 1862.

The edict of 1782, a citation of which appears in the Index of
1790, orders that: All persons having permission for the reading of
prohibited books must, not less often than once a year, make statement
to the confessors of the books of this class that they are utilising.
The confessors are authorised and instructed by the Inquisition to
revoke these permits in case they find that the reading in question
is causing injury to the faith of those holding the permits. The
confessors are to demand of the penitents from time to time, and in any
case at the time of the annual confession, whether they have in their
possession copies of prohibited books and whether in the course of the
year they have read any such books. In the former case, the penitents
must agree to deliver the books for destruction; and in the latter must
truly express their penitence for the sin committed. Until this has
been done, they are not to receive absolution.

The permits for the reading of prohibited books given by the Roman
Congregations are not valid in Spain. The permits issued directly by
the pope are to be delivered to the inquisitor-general in Spain or
to the council of the Inquisition, who are, if they are willing to
confirm them, to make registration of the same. They may, however,
refuse to confirm such Roman permits on the ground that the results
would be injurious for those using them. The permission to read
prohibited books or to possess copies of them, does not carry with it
the authority to import such books, to buy or to sell copies, to make
presentation of copies, or to exchange them for other books.

Among the noteworthy books contained in the supplement to the
Spanish Index, issued in 1805, may be mentioned the following:
Bonnet, _Oeuvres_, 18 volumes; the works of Alexander Pope, Laurence
Sterne (the reference is to the French version), Forster, _Voyage
Philosophique_; Smith, the _Wealth of Nations_ (French version); Burke,
_Reflections on the French Revolution_; _Die Rechte des Menschen_, a
reply to Burke’s treatise on the Revolution, etc.

_14._ _Examples of Spanish Prohibitions. 1559–1768._ The first of
the Spanish Indexes, that of Valdes in 1551, contains but one or two
Spanish titles, but the lists of 1559 and 1570 give evidence of fuller
attention to Spanish authors. The books prohibited belonged for the
most part not to heretical literature, but were those presenting,
in translations of the Scriptures or in controversies on points of
doctrine, matter that was not safe or not suitable for the knowledge
of the general lay public. The Inquisition in Spain had, from the
beginning, been more sharply opposed than were the Church authorities
elsewhere, to the distribution to the lay public of literature, and
particularly of literature in the vernacular, having to do with the
doctrines of the Church, even when such books were sound in their own
teachings and had been prepared to expose and to repress error. The
inquisitors took the ground that it was wiser to keep the faithful
in ignorance of the existence of errors. An example of this policy
is the prohibition in the Index of Valdes in 1559 of the writings of
Francisco de Borja, who was later enrolled with the saints, and of
Juan de Avila, Luis de Granada, who have since been classed with the
best of the ascetic writers and as “shining lights in God’s Church in
Spain.”[192] In 1571, permission was refused by the Inquisition for the
printing of a Spanish version of the Roman Catechism. Valdes prohibited
all tracts, letters, and pamphlets, reports of sermons, etc., that had
to do with the Scriptures or with the Sacraments. This prohibition
included any reprints in the Spanish tongue of the Gospels or of
extracts from the Gospels or of the Epistles of Paul.

A prohibition initiated by Quiroga was continued through the following
century, condemning “comedies, tragedies, and farces in which any
reflection or ridicule was cast upon the Sacraments, the practice of
church-going, the holy orders, or the Inquisition.” In 1581, the Index
of Lisbon added to the above a prohibition of the presentation on
the stage of any ecclesiastical characters or the performance of any
sacramental acts. This latter ruled out, of course, the representation
of marriage. In one of the later Indexes, the second part of _Don
Quixote_ comes into the list of works to be expurgated, but the
material condemned comprises but a single sentence: _Las obras de
charidad que se hazen flaxamente, no tienen merito ni valen nada_.

It is a characteristic of the Spanish expurgatory Indexes that they
do not give the references by chapter and by page to the texts of the
authors corrected. Mendham points out that the careful and orthodox
student, who might wish to assure himself of the accuracy of his own
literary guides, would find it important to refer to the originals
of the corrected texts if only in order to be placed in a position
to defend the action of his Church and to confound or possibly even
to convert heretical opposers. “Supposing for instance,” says he,
“a discussion should take place between a believer and an heretical
critic, and the latter should have the hardihood to assert that the
sentences condemned in the Index were not the _ipsissima verba_ or
the necessary sense of the author referred to, what reply could be made
by the defender of the Index who had never been able to make personal
examination of the text in question?”[193]

In 1827, there was published in the _Protestant Guardian_ (on pages
118 _et seq._) a review of the censures in the expurgatory Indexes.
The writer gives as examples of erasures that seemed to him to be
futile or at least open to criticism the following: In the _Glossarium
Graeco-Barbarum_ of Mensius, out of twenty-five erasures fifteen
consist simply in expunging before the names of Junius and other
learned men the terms _V. C._, _Eruditus_, etc.

So far from its being lawful to admit that a Protestant could be
either learned or illustrious, it was forbidden even to give the name
of theologians to Protestants pretending to Holy Orders. The English
bishops always figure in the Indexes under the term “pseudo-episcopi.”
This is doubtless, however, a logical term for the Church to use
concerning officials who must of necessity have been considered as
usurping laymen. In the erasures in the ninth book of the history of De
Thou, we find corrections of a more exacting character. The following
is an instance: _Theologis, qui ad concilium_, pro _Theologis_ scribe
_iis_. _Et ibi decrevisse viros bonos mittere_, dele _bonos_.

The censor actually follows through his rambles the wandering Jew of
Tudela, although the translation of this narrative was issued by so
good a Catholic as Montanus (himself a censor) in order to blot out
every kind word which Benjamin had uttered respecting his nation. For
example: _Filius Jonae probandae memoriae_, dele _probandae memoriae_;
_Synagoga sacra_, dele vocem _sacra_; _Filii Haziddai felicis
memoriae_, dele _felicis memoriae_; and so on through a folio page.

It is somewhat curious that such works of English writers as have been
considered by the framers of the Index, are placed almost exclusively
in the prohibitory division, and in this are included in the first
class, that is to say, under the heading of authors whose works, past,
present, and future (_opera edita et edenda_), are absolutely
prohibited. One of the few English books which have been mentioned by
title (apart from the names of the authors) in the prohibitory Index
is the version of the Psalms by Sternhold and Hopkins. This is the
book understood to be referred to by the title _Psalmes of Dauid in
Englische Metre_.




                             CHAPTER XIII

            THE INDEX OF ALEXANDER VII AND THE CONDEMNATION
                        OF GALILEO--ROME, 1664


In 1664, was published at Rome the _Index Prohibitorius_ of Alexander
VII. In the accompanying Bull, the Pope says that since the publication
of the Index of Clement VIII, a number of books had been prohibited
by his successors and by the Congregation of the Index, but no
authoritative schedule of the same had been issued which presented
in one comprehensive list the titles of the books and the names of
their authors. He had, therefore, caused a new Index to be compiled
which contained all the titles from the lists of Trent and of Clement,
together with all the further prohibitions, and in which, for
convenience of reference, the three classes of the Trent Index had
been put together, which enabled the titles to be presented in one
alphabeted list. The division into three classes of the books condemned
had in any case been open to the objection that it had “tended to give
the impression that the books of Class I were more pernicious than
those of Classes II and III and their reading more reprehensible; while
as a fact there were in the third class not a few works much wickeder
than any in the other classes.”

In addition to the titles of the prohibited books, this Index presents
the complete series of the decrees since that of the Trent Index,
under which the prohibitions were ordered. “The several regulations,
condemnations, and prohibitions,” continues the rescript, “presented
in this Index, we do hereby, under the Apostolic authority, confirm
and approve as in force at this time and as binding on all the members
of the Church; and we order that all universities, their associations,
and individuals shall give obedience to the same without exception or
reservation.” Then follow the specifications of penalties, seventeen in
all, and instructions to bishops and inquisitors for the publication of
the regulations and enforcement of the penalties.

In 1665, the Secretary of the Index Congregation, Vincentius Fanus,
published an edition of Alexander’s Index, with the omission of the
Clementine lists and of the series of decrees.

In 1667, was published, either at Lyons or Geneva, a reprint of the
text as revised by Fanus, but with the addition of the Clementine
lists and of the series of decrees. The latter are brought down to
1667. Fanus says of his edition that it is more comprehensive and more
correct than that of 1664. It is not clear, however, from what sources
his additional titles are taken. The division into three classes is
abandoned; but he points out that there is no difficulty in identifying
to which class an entry belongs. The name of an author, for instance,
not followed by any book-title indicates Class I; the title of a book
without name of author indicates Class III; while the author’s name
connected with title stands for Class II, which constitutes the bulk
of the Index. Fanus has some idea of bibliographical method. He makes
cross-references for authors who in previous Indexes are presented
sometimes under a forename and sometimes under a surname, the latter
being frequently of course derived from the place of residence. The
Index contains an “Address to the Reader” by Fr. Hyacinthus Libellus,
Fanus’s predecessor. In this address, the Secretary takes the ground
that all other Indexes are to be considered as “private” (_i. e._
unofficial).

The first list in the series covers 160 pages. The second list presents
exclusively books the title of which is followed by the name of the
author. The third list is confined to books the title of which follows
the name of the author. Then follows an appendix covering titles from
1661 to 1664, and this is followed by the text of the Tridentine Index,
to which is prefixed an _Admonition_ by Libellus giving the origin
and the history of that Index. Libellus affirms that the deputation of
the Index, originally instituted by Pius IV, was matured into a formal
congregation by Pius V.

The concluding division is entitled: _Index Decretorum_. This is
said to present _Omnia Decreta quae vel a Magistro Sac. Palatiti, cum
ratione Officii siu, tum Jussu Sac. Congregationis, vel ab ipsis Sacris
Congregationibus Indicis, et S. Officii emanuerunt_.

This Index of 1664 is noteworthy as containing the formal condemnation
of the works of Copernicus and Galileo, and of all other writings
which affirmed the movement of the earth and the stability of the sun.
The proceedings against Galileo and the Copernican doctrine had been
instituted in 1616 under Paul V. The final condemnation of Galileo was
given in 1633, under Urban VIII.

=The Condemnation of Galileo, and of the Copernican Theory of the
Solar System.=--The fourteenth and twentyeighth of the decrees
summarised in the Index of 1664 present the record of the condemnation
of Galileo. The records of the long series of the proceedings, upon
which the final condemnation of Galileo was based, constitute a
considerable mass of literature. It is necessary here to make reference
only to the more essential conclusions arrived at by the Church
authorities.

In March, 1616, the Congregation of the Index, under the instructions
of Pope Paul V., had rendered a decree to the effect that “the doctrine
of the double motion of the earth about its axis and about the sun
is false and entirely contrary to Holy Scripture.” The same decree
condemned all writings of Copernicus and all writings which affirmed
the motion of the earth. These condemnations were inscribed upon the
Index and in connection with this Index was issued the usual papal Bull
giving to its monitions the most solemn papal sanction. “To teach or
even to read the works denounced or the passages condemned was to risk
persecution in this world and damnation in the next.”[194]

The abjuration of Galileo bears date July 22, 1633. The decree of the
same date, which sentences the philosopher to imprisonment and other
penance, sets forth that the ground of the charge against him was his
statement that the sun was the centre of the system and was immovable,
and that the earth, revolving around the sun and also around its own
axis, was movable. The decree sets forth further that, in 1616, the
offender had been admonished by Cardinal Bellarmin, and that in the
same year the Congregation of the Index issued a decree condemning
the doctrine; notwithstanding this condemnation, Galileo had again
offended by repeating the same erroneous theories in a volume entitled
_Dialogo_.

This volume, issued in 1632, was a treatise presented in the form of a
dialogue, exhibiting the arguments for and against the Copernican and
Ptolemaic systems. The publication was the result of discussions which
had extended through eight years, and was finally permitted only on the
condition that the volume should contain a preface, for the wording
of which Ricciardi, master of the sacred palace, was responsible, but
which bore the signature of Galileo, and in which the Copernican theory
was described as a mere play of the imagination and as not in fact
opposed to the Ptolemaic doctrine. The book secured at once a large
circulation and a widespread influence. The preface was disregarded
or was laughed at, while the reasonings in the dialogue were accepted
by many as practically conclusive of the Copernican doctrine. These
reasonings were considered by the new Pope, Urban VIII, as bringing him
into ridicule and, under the Pope’s instructions, Galileo and his books
were placed in the hands of the Inquisition. It was later contended
by certain Catholic writers that Galileo was condemned not for his
opinions or theories, but for having claimed to found these theories on
Scripture. Sir Robert Inglis is quoted by Mendham as having maintained
this view as late as 1824.[195] This contention appears however to
be fairly met by the fact that the Roman Index of 1704 contains an
explicit condemnation of “all works maintaining the mobility of the
earth and the immobility of the sun.”

The decree numbered thirty-eight and issued August 23, 1634, specifies,
with other condemned books, _Dialogo di Galileo Galilei_. Decree
number fourteen connects with the condemned Copernican doctrine the
name not of Galileo but of Foscarini. It adds, however, the general
sentence: _Aliosque omnes libros pariter idem docentes_.

The names of both Foscarini and Galileo appear in the body of the
Index, the first under _Lettera_, the second under _Dialogo_. In the
Roman Index of 1704 (first edition), the following entry stands in
its alphabetic place: _Libri omnes docentes mobilitatem Terrae et
immobilitatem solis_. In all later editions of the Index this entry
was, however, omitted.[196]

Sundry theologians of the Inquisition were instructed to examine two
propositions which had been extracted from Galileo’s letters on the
solar system. Their decision was rendered as follows:

   “The first proposition, that the sun is the centre and does not
   revolve about the earth, is foolish, absurd, false in theology,
   and heretical, because expressly contrary to Holy Scripture”;
   and “the second proposition, that the earth is not the centre
   but revolves about the sun, is absurd, false in philosophy, and
   from a theological point of view, at least, opposed to the true
   faith.”[197]

The ground on which had been based the contention of the defenders
of the Church that Galileo had made the Scriptures responsible for
his new theory of the solar system, was a suggestion contained in
letters written by the astronomer to his friend Castelli and to the
Grand Duchess Christine, to the effect that his discoveries might be
reconciled with Scripture.

The result of the long contest is now, of course, fully on record.
The examinations and discussions had extended over a period of sixteen
years. Galileo had for a large portion of that time been kept in prison
under the direct control of the Roman Inquisition. It appears from the
records, which have been summarised by Andrew White and others, that
by the express order of Pope Urban he was menaced from time to time
with torture, although it is probable that physical torture was never
actually administered. The old man was finally (in 1633) forced to
pronounce publicly and on his knees a recantation worded as follows:

   “I, Galileo, being in my seventieth year, being a prisoner and
   on my knees, and before your Eminences, having before my eyes
   the Holy Gospel, which I touch with my hands, abjure, curse,
   and detest the error and the heresy of the movement of the
   earth.”[198]

The Inquisitors were ordered not to permit the publication of any
further editions of Galileo’s works or of any writings upholding
his theories. On the other hand, “theologians were urged, now that
Copernicus and Galileo and Kepler were silenced, to reply to them with
tongue and pen.” Europe was flooded with these theological refutations
of the Copernican system.[199]

The authority of the Index of the Congregation and of the Papacy
back of the Index remained committed to the position taken by Pope
Urban and his advisers until the time of Benedict XIV. In 1757, under
instructions given by Benedict, the Congregation of the Index removed
the old-time restrictions on writings advocating the Copernican system.
As late, however, as 1765, Lalande, the great French astronomer,
attempted without success to secure from the authorities at Rome the
removal from the Index of the works of Galileo.

Artaud, writing in the Dublin _Review_ in September, 1865, in defence
of the record of the Church, states that Galileo’s _Dialogue_ was
published complete in Padua in 1714, “with the usual approbations.” In
the same article, it is stated that in 1818 the ecclesiastical decrees
were repealed by Pius VII in full Consistory.[200] The historian Cantu,
however, who is described as an authority favourable to the Church,
speaks of the work of Copernicus as remaining on the Index as late as
1835.[201] Cantu’s authority is supported by Reusch.[202]

In 1820, Canon Settele, professor of astronomy at Rome, had ready for
publication an elementary textbook which was based upon the Copernican
system. The master of the sacred palace, Anfossi, refused to allow the
book to be printed unless Settele would reshape it and would refer to
the Copernican theory as merely an hypothesis. The professor appealed
to Pope Pius VII by whom the matter was referred to the Congregation of
the Inquisition. The issue aroused considerable discussion but finally,
on the eleventh of September, 1822, the cardinals of the Inquisition
agreed upon the concession that “the printing and publication of works
treating of the motion of the earth and the stability of the sun, in
accordance with the general opinion of modern astronomers, is hereafter
permitted at Rome.”[203]

The decree was ratified by Pius VII and, after a delay of two years,
the professor was permitted to place his book in the hands of the
printers. It may, I judge, be inferred that until the publication of
this volume, late in 1822, the pupils in the orthodox Catholic schools
had not been permitted the use of any textbooks on astronomy, the
conclusions of which were in accord with the Copernican system. It was
not until 1835, thirteen years after the decision of the cardinals,
that an edition of the Index appeared in which was omitted all
condemnation of works defending the double motion of the earth.

The divines in the Protestant Church were no more favourable than were
the Catholic theologians to the Copernican theory of the universe.
Lutherans, Calvinists, Anglicans, and Protestant teachers alike placed
themselves on record as in opposition to the teachings of Copernicus
and of Galileo. The great preacher in London, Dr. South, denounced as
irreligious the report of the Royal Society in which the Copernican
doctrine had been accepted. As late as 1724, Professor John Hutchinson
of Cambridge, in a treatise entitled the _Principia of Moses_,
undertook to build up from the text of the Bible a complete physical
system of the universe. In this treatise, the Newtonian and Copernican
theories were condemned as atheistic. In 1722, Thomas Burnett, in the
sixth edition of his _Sacred Theory of the Earth_, argues for
the scriptural doctrine of the earth’s stability. In Holland, the
Calvinistic Church was from the outset strenuously opposed to the whole
new system. The opposition of the Lutherans was continued until a very
late date. In 1873, was issued by the Lutheran publishing house of St.
Louis a work entitled _Astronomische Unterredung_, in which was
again maintained the theory that the earth is a fixed body and the
centre of the universe.

These utterances from the Protestants present sufficient evidence
that the old theologies as they were then interpreted could not
easily be reconciled with the now accepted views of the constitution
of the universe. It does not appear, however, that in any one of the
Protestant realms the opposition of the divines to the new astronomy
was associated with any persecution either of authors or instructors.
The Church of Rome must assume the responsibility for having continued
during a series of years, which ended only with the lifetime of its
victim, the persecution of a great scientist whose only crime was his
exceptional capacity for scientific investigation and his desire to
present simply and effectively what he believed to be the truth. In
1852, two hundred and twenty years after the condemnation of Galileo,
which had been brought about largely through the influence of the
Jesuits, the astronomer Secchi, himself a Jesuit, presented, in one of
the churches at Rome, the experiment of Foucault with the pendulum,
making clear to the human eye the movement of the earth about its own
axis.[204]

Another noteworthy title in the Index of 1664 is that of the _Lettres
Provinciales_ of Pascal. Mendham finds ground for surprise that an
author who could maintain so emphatically certain of the most exacting
pretensions of the Church of Rome should have been thought deserving of
condemnation. In the seventeenth of the _Lettres Provinciales_,
Pascal writes:

   “_Grâce à Dieu, je n’ai d’attache sur la terre qu’à la seule
   Église Catholique, Apostolique, Romaine, dans laquelle je
   veux vivre et mourir, et dans la communion avec le Pape, son
   souverain chef, hors de laquelle je suis très persuadé qu’il n’y
   a point de salut._”

_1._ _1685._ _Paris._ _Decrees of Louis XIV._--In 1685, shortly
before the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, Louis XIV ordered the
suppression and destruction of the writings of the Protestants. Harlay,
Archbishop of Paris, thereupon published, at the request of the
Parliament of Paris, a catalogue of these books which has, as compared
with the Roman indexes, a distinctive character of its own. In this
list of books condemned and ordered to be destroyed, no reference is
made to the Indexes of the Roman series, and, on their part, these
Indexes give no consideration to the Paris catalogue.

A convention of the clergy held in 1682, published a pastoral letter
(_Un Avertissement pastoral_) addressed to those who followed the
so-called reformed faith. The purpose of this _Avertissement_ was
stated to be a reconciliation with the Church of these backsliders; and
it included a _mémoire_ setting forth the different methods that
could to advantage be followed in order to bring about the conversion
of these heretics. Included in this _mémoire_ is a statement of
orthodox doctrine entitled “Doctrine of the Church as contained in
its profession of faith and in the Decrees of the Council of Trent as
opposed to the calumnies and the false charges spread to the world in
the works of the so-called reformers.”

In 1685, the convention addressed a brief to the King in which it is
stated that the clergy did not demand a revocation of the Edict by
means of which earlier kings, under unhappy conditions and on grounds
that no longer existed, had for a time permitted the practice of the
so-called reformed religion. The request was, however, submitted to
the King that during the time in which the Edict should yet remain in
force, the reformers were to be forbidden in their sermons or writings
to abuse or to libel the Catholic Church. In August, 1685, Louis XIV
published an edict in which reformers were forbidden to preach or
to write against the faith and the doctrine of the Roman Catholic
religion. They were further to be permitted to print only such books as
contained the statement of their own creed, the text of their prayers,
and their rules of discipline. All controversial books having to do
with the Catholic faith were condemned, prohibited, and ordered to
be destroyed. Any disobedience to this edict is to be punished with
banishment and confiscation of property. The printing or the selling of
the prohibited books is to be punished with a fine of 1600 livres, and
with the cancellation of the license to print. The list of the books
so condemned was published in September, 1685, under the authority of
Archbishop Harlay and with an _arrêt_ of Parliament. The title is,
_Catalogue des livres condamnéz et deffendus par le Mandement de M.
l’Archevésque de Paris_.

The catalogue is arranged alphabetically, but at the close is a
supplement containing forty-five titles without alphabetical order. The
titles are restricted to books printed either in Latin or in French but
include a number which have been issued outside of France. This Index
condemns as “scandalous” all versions of the Scriptures prepared by the
Protestant ministers. In October was published the edict revoking the
Edict of Nantes.

_2._ _Belgian Indexes 1695–1735._--In the beginning of the 18th
century, were printed in Namur two lists made up from the Roman Index.
The first carries no editorial name and is printed in Latin under the
title _Elenchus propositionum et librorum prohibitorum_. It bears the
date 1709. The second carries the name, as compiler, of Jean Baptiste
Hannot. The text is in French. The title reads _Index ou Catalogue des
principaux livres condamnés et défendus par l’Église_. This bears date
1714. It comprises a selection of works in support of Jansenism. The
compiler is a zealous member of the society of Jesus. Both these lists
are private undertakings, issued under no ecclesiastical or political
authority.

In January, 1695, Precipiano, Archbishop of Mechlin, published a
decree which orders the condemnation of seventy-three works, chiefly
the writings of the Jansenists. Among the titles given in the
_Elenchus_ of 1709 are the works of “de Chartes” (Descartes) and
of Copernicus. The Index contains the following remark:

   “A number of the books which were prohibited in the Tridentine
   Index, such as the works of Erasmus and Molinäus, have been
   corrected in the Antwerp _Index expurgatorius_. It may
   therefore be assumed that the later editions of these works
   have been printed with the approved text.”

The Index of Hannot, while unofficial, secured later the approval of
the Bishop of Namur. The Index of Precipiano undertook to prohibit only
books which had not already been prohibited in Rome. The Congregation
of the Index paid no attention to the lists prepared by Precipiano.
Of the long list of Calvinistic books condemned by Precipiano, only
one, a treatise by Basnage, was prohibited in Rome (not until 1728),
and of the sixty Jansenist writings only two, the _Difficultés_ of
Arnauld and an essay of Quesnel, found place in the Roman lists.
Brussels, 1735.--_Catalogus Preliminaris donec amplior sequatur,
Quorundam Librorum tum prohibitorum tum noxiorum aut Periculosorum et
Proscriptorum e Belgio Austriaco_, etc. The first division is devoted
to an _Instructio Summaria_ comprising the general rules; then follows
the body of the Index under the title: _Instructio specifica sine
Catalogus_, etc. This Index is distinctive in giving in a separate
schedule, connected with the titles by numbers, the grounds on which
the books are condemned. The schedule is entitled: _Qualificationes
et Censurae Librorum_. The lists are largely devoted to the works of
Jansen, Quesnel, and van Espen. The Index is said by Mendham to have
been the work of the Jesuit Father Wouters Hoynck van Papendrecht,
Archpriest of Malines. The regulations provide for minute and vexatious
visits of printeries and bookshops, and for interference with sales
of books. The Index appears never to have got beyond the status of
a scheme. It secured the cordial approval of the Governess, the
Duchess Marie Elizabeth, but the Council of Brabant objected to the
publication, and appears to have been strong enough to maintain its
objection. The regulations of the Index failed, therefore, to secure
the sanction of law, and were not put into force. The result indicates
that the authority of Philip IV in Brabant was not as final as had been
that of Philip II. The scheme comes into print in a supplemental volume
of the works of van Espen.[205]

The introduction contains the following noteworthy observation:

   “_Il seroit inutile de répéter que dans tout le dit Catalogue
   on ne trouve pas condamné un seul livre de ceux qui ont voulu
   attribuer aux Papes ce pouvoir illimité, à l’égard des Princes
   seculiers, ce qui prouve encore le nécessité qu’il y a de
   maintenir les auteurs qui à cet égard ont soutenu les droits des
   Princes._”

This complaint occurs not infrequently on the part of the critics of
the Indexes. It was made among others by Fra Paolo in his _Discorso_ on
the Inquisition already referred to.

It is noteworthy that the members of the council speak of the author
of the Index as being unknown to them. It is evident that they do not
accept as real the authors whose names are given. It is a suggestion
of Mendham that the chief purpose of the production of this particular
Index was the proscription by the Jesuits of the works of van Espen.
It is evident in any case from the character of the books selected for
condemnation, as well as from the wording of the documents connected
with the lists, that this Index was a part of the long fight of the
Jesuits against the followers of Jansenius.

Among the authors condemned in this Index was, curiously enough, the
well-known bishop and eloquent preacher, Bossuet, called by some
of his contemporaries the Eagle of Meaux, and also the _Mallens
Haereticorum_. The full title of the work condemned is as follows:
_Defensio declarationis celeberrimae quam de Potestate ecclesiastica
sanxit Clerus Gallicanus, 19 Martii, 1682, ab Illus. ac Rev. Jacobo
Benigno Bossuet Meldensi Episcopo, ex speciali jussu Ludovici Magni
Scripta_, 2 vol. 4to, Luxemburgi, 1730.

_3._ _Bohemian Indexes, 1726–1767._--In 1726, was printed in Prague
a reprint of the Roman Index of 1704 together with the appendix of
1716. In 1729, was printed at Königgrätz, as a supplement to the
Roman Index, an _Index prohibitorius_ and _expurgatorius_ in which
special consideration is given to works in Latin, in German, and in
Czech which had found circulation in Bohemia. The main title reads:
_Clavis haeresim claudens et aperiens_. This is followed by a Bohemian
title the substance of which is: “A key which has for its purpose
the making clear to the understanding the pernicious character of
heretical writings, and which, in so doing, shall provide for their
extermination; or a catalogue of pernicious works which are likely to
cause mischief and which on this ground have been prohibited, together
with instructions for the identification of such dangerous writings for
extermination of same.”

In 1749, was printed at Prague a second and enlarged edition of this
_Clavis_. In 1767, the Archbishop of Prague, Przichovsky, printed,
in obedience to an encyclical of Clement XIII, an Index presenting
Bohemian books only. The title is: _Index Bohemicorum librorum
prohibitorum et corrigendorum et ordine alphabetico digestus_, etc. In
the _Clavis_ of 1729, the _Index prohibitorius_ is arranged in three
alphabeted divisions, the first including the works in Czech, the
second those in German, and the third the Latin titles, with which
are certain in French. Following each division, are given certain
blank pages left for the description of further books. In the second
edition is given a special division entitled _Index librorum Veneria
vel obscoena tractantium_, presenting a list of works the obscene
character of which can fairly be inferred from their titles. It is
noteworthy that this very legitimate division of censorship, which
received very little attention either in Rome or in Spain, should have
been cared for in Bohemia. Beneath the titles of the books in the list
for expurgation, are given as a rule brief analyses constituting what
might be called a _catalogue raisonnée_, for instance, _perstringuntur
religiosi Societatis Jesu_, etc. Against such a name as that of Huss
is added the term “heretic” or “arch-heretic.” The compiler of the
_Clavis_ was a Jesuit, Anton Koniasch. Koniasch left at his death
(in 1760) materials for a further Index which were utilised as the
basis of the Index printed in 1767 by Przichovsky. The title proposed
by Koniasch was: _Index librorum perniciosorum abolendorum vel
repurgandorum_, etc. In the Index as published by the Archbishop, is
the order that his pastoral brief, together with the encyclical of the
pope, shall, within three weeks’ time, be read on the Sunday in all
German and Bohemian churches, and that, on the same day, a sermon shall
be given devoted to the danger of heretical books. He orders further
that whoever shall be convicted of reading heretical or prohibited
books shall _ipse jure_ come under excommunication. This is followed by
an edict, issued by Charles VI and confirmed in 1749 by Maria Theresa,
in regard to the distribution of heretical books. This Index is both
prohibitory and expurgatory, but the two sets of titles are arranged
in one alphabet. It contains also an enlarged edition of the Bohemian
division of the _Clavis_.


=4. Editions of the Roman Indexes, 1670–1800.=

_1670._ _Rome._ _Clement X._ In 1670, under the instructions of Clement
X, Fanus prints an Index which contains the lists of Alexander and of
Clement, with an appendix bringing the record of prohibitions down to
date. This volume is again printed in 1675, with an appendix covering
the prohibitions of five years.

_1681._ _Rome._ _Clement XI._ In 1681, under the instructions of
Clement XI, Jacobus Riccius again reprints the same lists and decrees
with supplements. An edition of this Index of 1681 was printed in
Munich in 1683. Riccius states in his preface that, in addition to
the including of the titles of the later prohibitions, he has found
occasion for a number of corrections, both in the titles and in
the names of the authors. The editors of the Roman Indexes are now
beginning to show some regard for bibliographical completeness and
typographical accuracy.

A second impression of the Riccius Index was printed in Rome in 1682,
and a third edition appeared in 1739, printed without change, and the
later prohibitions are recorded in a series of appendices. Between the
years 1704 and 1744, were also printed various editions of this Index,
in which the titles of the works prohibited from 1704 to 1739 find
place in the main alphabet. Reusch points out, however, that from 1682
to 1754 no official edition of an Index was printed in Rome. A number
of Indexes bearing the imprint of the Apostolic printing-office were
as a matter of fact manufactured elsewhere, chiefly in Venice.[206]
Riccini, or Riccius, who served from 1749 to 1759 as secretary of the
Index Congregation, states that for more than seventy years no official
editions of the Index were printed in Rome; and that the editions
issued from the presses of Venice, presenting the false imprints of
the Roman office, contained many blunders and were not to be accepted
as authoritative. The official and approved editions must in any case
include an introductory word from the secretary of the Congregation.

The Index of Clement XI contains, as first printed, one alphabeted
list. In later editions, this list is followed by appendices which,
by the year 1734, had aggregated five. The first of these appendices
has the epithet _Unica_. It is suggested that this term indicates
that the appendix has been substituted for a previous faulty appendix.
It is Hannot’s understanding that the fault in the cancelled appendix
consisted in a condemnation which had been almost immediately revoked.

In this same Appendix _Unica_ appears for the first time in an Index
the name of Fénelon, Archbishop of Cambray. The work condemned is
_Explications des Maximes des Saints_. The particular offence in the
volume is understood by Mendham to have been the acceptance by Fénelon
of the views of the mystical Spanish nun, Sor d’Agreda. There were
evidently, however, some other matters in Fénelon’s volume which were
found to be dangerous, as the Pope, Innocent XII, found occasion to
issue in regard to it a special _Constitution_ in which were condemned
twenty-three propositions extracted from Fénelon’s _Explications_. The
perusal of the work was forbidden, under pain of excommunication, to
all the faithful without exception. The _Constitution_ bears date,
March 12, 1699. In the same year, there was issued at Paris an _Arrêt
de la Cour de Parlement_ enregistering the letters patent of the king
for the execution of this _Constitution_. The Archbishop appears to
have accepted without protest the condemnation of the Pope and the
authority of the High Court of Parliament.

_1704._ _Rome._ _Index Prohibitorius._--_Index Librorum Prohibitorum
Innoc. XII. P.M. jussu. editus. Usque ad Annum 1681. Eidem accedit in
fine Appendix usque ad mensem Junii._

_1711._ _Rome Index: Prohibitorius._ This Index, issued under the
authority of Clement XI, has no prefatory matter and simply extends up
to the date of 1710 the lists of the next preceding Roman Index.

_1744._ _Rome. Index Prohibitorius._ This Index is characterised as
distinctive in the absence of all the customary prefatory articles
excepting the _Regulae_. Among the works prohibited is a treatise of
the Jesuit Benzi, which had some importance in the controversies of the
period.

_1750._ _Rome._ _Index Prohibitorius._--This is a reprint of the above
with additions to 1750.

_1785–1798._ _Rome._ _Decrees of Prohibition._ During the period above
specified, there was published at Rome a weekly journal under the title
of the _Giornale Ecclesiastico_. The series for the thirteen years
covers thirteen volumes. This journal was utilised for the publication
of the decrees issued against specific books by the authorities of
the Church. The first work receiving the compliment of such special
condemnation was a treatise of Eybel entitled _Was ist der Pabst?_ The
author is characterised as one of the ancient enemies of the Apostolic
See. Excommunication is ordered against any readers, possessors, or
printers of the work and the absolution or relaxation of the penalty is
reserved to the pope excepting in the moment of death. A later volume
contains a regular decree by the Congregation of the Index in which are
condemned twenty-four different works. In the fourth volume appears
among other titles the _Pensées_ of Pascal, with Voltaire’s Notes.
The volume contains also a specification of the dogmatic constitution
issued by the pope against the Council of Pistoria. Mendham refers
to the Memoirs of De Ricci as containing an explanation of this
condemnation.

_5._ _1815._ _Madrid._ _Index Prohibitorius._--The lists in this Index,
which is issued as usual under the authority of the inquisitor-general
(only recently restored to power) are devoted almost exclusively to
Spanish publications.




                              CHAPTER XV

                    ERASMUS AND LUTHER IN THE INDEX


=1. Erasmus in the Index.=--The treatment accorded by the compilers of
the Indexes of the 16th century to the writings of Erasmus is entitled
to separate reference, if only because the variety of the successive
prohibitions and classifications gives evidence of the difficulties
experienced by the authorities of the Church in maintaining any
consistency of policy in regard to the supervision of critical
literature. The position of Erasmus among the leaders of thought of
his time was, of course, in many respects exceptional. His varied and
comprehensive attainments placed him among the first scholars of the
world. He united with scholarship a keen sense of humour, an incisive
and forcible literary style, and a courage of opinion which were not
hampered by any large measure of reverence for authority or tradition.
His writings, in their original Latin form, found their way in the
first place to the educated circles of the upper classes and of the
more liberal-minded of the ecclesiastics, while the versions in the
vernacular which speedily followed, in both authorised and unauthorised
editions, were taken up with cordial appreciation by all classes of
readers throughout Europe. In fact, in popularity, as far as popularity
is to be gauged by the extent of circulation, the books of Erasmus were
surpassed only by the writings of Luther, while the range of their
distribution --that is, the extent of the territory reached and the
variety of the circles of readers by whom they were welcomed--must have
been much in advance of anything attained by the writings of Luther.

The attacks of Erasmus on the abuses which had grown up in the Church
were of course a most important factor in bringing about the conditions
that made the Reformation possible, and in fact inevitable; but
Erasmus fought for reform within the Church of which he always held
himself to be a dutiful son. He refused from the outset to take part
with the Protestant assault on the authority of the Church universal,
and his scholarship and influence were undoubtedly a most important
influence in helping to maintain this authority against the fierce
antagonism of the Lutheranism of Germany and the Calvinism of Geneva.
And yet at the very time when the reformers of Wittenberg, in their
keen disappointment that they were not to have in their long fight the
co-operation of the great scholar who had so fully realised and so
trenchantly assailed the evils against which they were revolting, were
condemning the writings of Erasmus as unchristian and time-serving,
the censors of Rome were placing these same books on the Index as
constituting serious heresy. From Wittenberg, were hurled fierce
denunciations of the trimmer, the time-server, the man who was sinning
against the light; while from Rome came bitter charges of heresy
against the insidious enemy of the true Faith, against the man who,
trained in the Church, was using his scholarship to undermine its
authority.

Erasmus stood practically alone in the world of belief and of
disbelief. He had no sympathy with the doctrines of either Luther or
Calvin. He could not accept the theory of individual interpretation
of religious truth. He believed in a Church universal. He looked
and worked for the time when this world’s Church, shaking off the
corruption, the worldliness, and the vulgarity by which it had become
demoralised, should, under the leadership of scholars, wise, sane,
tolerant, and pure-minded, resume its authority over all Christian
believers. To this end, he continued to denounce and to hold up to
ridicule, as the worst enemies of the Church, the intolerant bigots and
the vulgar corruptionists whose actions were bringing it into disrepute
and strengthening the hands of the reformers.

An English scholar presents as follows the position of Erasmus:

   “It is the conclusion of Erasmus that the Bible, learning,
   criticism, humanism, are each and all incomplete as guides to
   man without the permanent interpretative power and historic
   witness of the visible institution ordained by Christ Himself.
   His appeal is always to Christ; but it is inconceivable to him
   that Christ should be apart from His Church or the Church from
   Him.... As critic and as historian, Erasmus found it impossible
   to say that Christ was right and that the fundamental principles
   of the continuous Church were wrong. Thus, what the Church
   had regarded as essential doctrines were and must remain the
   permanent, unalterable bases of loyalty to the Lord.... Erasmus
   believed in the Church not as a congeries of disintegrating
   elements, not as a rigid and inflexible machine, but as a
   sacred institution divinely instituted and divinely inspired,
   and because it was ever in touch with divine life continually
   growing and developing into the knowledge of the truth.... The
   Church was to him the body of Jesus Christ, and in Christ he
   profoundly believed; and, so believing, he was not impatient,
   not afraid to wait for light.”[207]

It is not surprising that the Congregation of the Index found
difficulty in classifying the writings of Erasmus. The predecessors
of Paul IV had held these writings in favourable consideration, and
to certain works had given distinct approval; and they had in various
instances extended to the author protection against attacks.[208] In
1516, Leo X praised his “sound morality, his rare scholarship, and
his distinguished services,”[209] and had accepted the dedication of
his New Testament. The second edition of the New Testament contains
an appreciative letter from Leo, dated September 10, 1518. Adrian VI,
writing in December, 1522, assures Erasmus that he gave no credence to
those who described him as a follower of Luther, and exhorts him to
continue the work of writing against the heretics. In January, 1523,
the Pope thanks him for the gift of the _Arnobius_.[210] Paul
III, in a brief of May, 1535, speaks of “having always held in esteem
the honoured name of Erasmus,” and refers to his great learning and
eloquence, and to his contests against the pernicious new errors.[211]

In August, 1535 (a year before the death of Erasmus), Paul appointed
him Provost of Deventer, by reason of his learning, his piety, and
the great services he had rendered to the Curia in his sturdy fight
with the apostates from the Faith.[212] Later, the Pope spoke of
wishing to make him cardinal.[213] The chief opponent of Erasmus
among the prelates of Rome was Aleander. Aleander prides himself on
having, as he believes, disposed Erasmus favourably towards himself,
because he hopes thus to be able to check Erasmus’s opportunities
for working further mischief.[214] Another antagonist of Erasmus was
Edward Lee, who, in 1532, became Archbishop of York. He wrote three
treatises in criticism of the Erasmus edition of the New Testament.
On the other hand, Erasmus found bitter assailants among such German
Reformation leaders as Luther, v. Hutten, Bucer, Corvinus, and others.
Some of the anti-Erasmus treatises of these writers find place in
the Index. The ninth volume of the works of Erasmus is made up of
the replies to his Protestant critics. From France, also, came sharp
criticisms against the writings of Erasmus, but these were the work
of orthodox authorities such as the theologians of the Sorbonne, and
the inquisitor-general. The Sorbonne sent out, between 1525 and 1530,
a number of condemnations of different books of Erasmus, but these
continued to come into print in Paris, with or without “privilege.” In
1531, appeared, under the permission of King Francis, editions of the
_Paraphrases_ and of the _Colloquia_.[215] In 1542, after the
death of Erasmus, the Sorbonne issued a general condemnation of his
writings, the list comprising fifteen titles.

In the Netherlands, Erasmus had the protection of the Emperor Charles
V. No one of his books finds place in the Louvain Indexes of 1546 and
1550. In that of 1558, is printed only the title of the French version
of the treatise _De Sarcienda Eccl. Concordia_. In the Indexes of
Italy, the name of Erasmus appears first in 1559, in the Index of Paul
IV. In Spain, Quiroga repeats, in the Index of 1583, the titles given
in the Index of Trent. In 1576, Paul Manutius printed in Florence,
under a “privilege” of Gregory XIII, an expurgated edition of the
_Adagia_. The privilege carried with it a prohibition of all other
editions. The Index of Sixtus V specifies this edition as permitted,
all others as condemned. The Index of Benedict XIV repeats the
authorisation for the Manutius edition, and confirms the prohibition of
the others unless expurgated.

The editors of the Index of Paul IV (1559) took a very serious view of
the evils of the writings of Erasmus. His name is placed in Class I,
and is connected with a condemnation more sweeping than that given to
Luther or to Calvin; “with all of his Commentaries, Remarks, Notes,
Dialogues, Letters, Criticisms, Translations, Books, and Writings,
including even those which contain nothing concerning Religion.” This
judgment was, however, materially modified five years later by the
Tridentine compilers, by whom, after some heated discussions, the
name of Erasmus was transferred to Class II. _The Colloquies, Praise
of Folly, Institution of Christian Matrimony_, and the _Paraphrases_
(of the Gospel of Matthew) were condemned, as also certain of the
_Letters_. Others of the _Letters_ were restored to the class of
permitted literature, but only after such eliminations and alterations
that (as the chronicler remarks) they would not have been recognised
by their author[216] (Erasmus had died in 1536). The record of the
discussions in the commission is given in a letter written from Trent,
in 1563, by the Archbishop of Prague to the Emperor (Ferdinand I).
The Archbishop states that he had himself contended for the freeing
of the works of Erasmus from condemnation on the ground that he had
always submitted himself to the judgment of the Church; that his
literary undertakings had received the approval of Leo X; that he had
been engaged in many sharp contests with the heretical assailants of
the Church; that he had devoted to the editing of the writings of the
Fathers a scholarship of which the heretics might well envy the Church
the possession, and that he had died in the Faith. The Archbishop goes
on to say that the majority of his associates were of another way of
thinking, and had overborne the views of the few who wanted to secure
the preservation of the works of an author who had done such signal
service for the Church. He closes by asking the Emperor to relieve
him from service on the commission. He finds it difficult to work in
harmony with the churchmen from Spain and Italy who have no personal
knowledge of the heretics who are trying to destroy the Church.
The Emperor replied that the Archbishop, as the only German on the
commission, had been continued at his post to do what he might find
possible to prevent the condemnation of any further works and authors
of excellence.[217]

The introduction of the Tridentine Index orders placed in Class I all
authors who may have come under suspicion of heresy (_nota haeresis
suspecti_), a description which may be called elastic, and which
would naturally be subject to varying interpretation on the part of
different persons in authority. Among the associates or correspondents
of Erasmus who were placed by the Tridentine editors in the first
class and who have since remained under this general condemnation,
are Staupitz, Pirckheimer, Hauer, and Bellicanus. Rhenanus and Zasius
were transferred in the Trent lists from Class I, where they had been
placed by Paul, to Class II, where they have since remained.

The chief associate of Erasmus in the contest in Germany against the
opposition of a large group at least among the ecclesiastics, in behalf
of what may be called higher scholarship, was Reuchlin, who gave
years of his life to the work of securing for the German universities
the privilege of instruction in Greek and in Hebrew. After 1518,
when a number of the works of Erasmus had already found place in the
Index, the printers issuing editions of these within the territories
controlled by Church censorship found it convenient to omit from the
title-pages the name of their author. Such editions were issued, for
instance, in 1520 by Paul Manutius, the son of Aldus, bearing on the
title-page and in the catalogue, in place of the name of Erasmus, the
words, _Batavus quidam homo_.

In the Index of 1559, the name of Erasmus is placed under the class of
_Auctores quorum libri et scripta omnia prohibentur_. After the
entry of the name, however, comes the following specification: _cum
universis Commentariis, Annotationibus, Scholiis, Dialogis, Epistolis,
Censuris, Versionibus, Libris et Scriptis suis, etiam si nil penitus
contra Religionem, vel de Religione contineant_. Mendham refers to
this as an illustration of the term _De omnibus Rebus et quibusdam
aliis_. It may be recalled, in this connection, that as a result of
the dedication to Leo X printed by this condemned writer in the first
edition of his annotated Greek Testament, issued in 1516, the Pope
addressed to Erasmus a letter published in the second, and in every
subsequent, edition of the work, highly commending this production
of his dear son. The letter contains the following expressions:
_Quas nuper a te recognitas, et pluribus editis annotationibus,
locupletatas, illustratasque fuisse certiores facti, non mediocriter
gavisi fuimus, ex prima illa editione quae absolutissima videbatur,
conjecturam facientes, qualis haes futura, quantumve boni, sacrae
Theologiae studiosis, ac orthodoxae fidei nostrae sit allatura_.[218]

If, at this stage in the history of the Church, the utterance of the
reigning pope was already to be accepted as infallible, it is somewhat
difficult to understand how to bring into accord with these conclusions
the condemnation of half a century later, issued under the authority of
the no less infallible Pius IV. A similar instance had occurred earlier
in the reign of Pius II, who found occasion to include in the list of
writings by Catholic ecclesiastics to be condemned a treatise written
by himself eighteen years earlier under the title _Aeneae Sylviae
commentaria de actis et gestis Concilii Basileen_. This condemnation
is confirmed in the Tridentine Index in the following words: _In
actis Aeneae Sylviae prohibentur ea quae ipse in Bulla retractationis
damnavit_. Mendham speaks of this Bull as an example of a change of
opinion similar to that described by another pope confronted with a
similar difficulty, who explained that “when he was raised higher he
saw things more clearly.”[219]

In 1522, the sale and the perusal of the _Colloquies_ of Erasmus,
an authorised edition of which had been printed by Colines, were
interdicted by the censors of the Sorbonne. Erasmus reports that before
the date of the prohibition, no less than twenty-four thousand copies
of this Paris edition had been sold.

In 1528, Erasmus made application for a privilege for the publication
in France of his edition of the works of St. Augustine, but the
influence of the Sorbonne was sufficient to prevent the permit being
given. The reason why Erasmus considered it important to have this work
issued from Paris was that the Paris University was at the time the
centre for theological undertakings, as the University of Bologna was
for instruction in jurisprudence.

Erasmus was able to write in regard to the _Praise of Folly_ that
the pope “had read it through from beginning to end and that kings,
bishops, archbishops, and cardinals were delighted with it.”[220]
The favour given to the book by the pope and by not a few of the
scholarly ecclesiastics did not prevent its prohibition in many of the
universities, including Paris, Louvain, Oxford, and Cambridge.

The prohibition of the _Praise of Folly_ carried with it the
condemnation of the previous writings of the author. This is the
literature, cried the clergy, that comes from a knowledge of Greek.

In 1515, Erasmus took time from his literary work to interest himself
in behalf of his friend, the learned and high-minded Reuchlin, the
greatest Hebrew scholar of the day. Reuchlin had fallen under the
persecution of the Dominicans, led by the ignorant and bigoted
Hoogstraaten, for his opposition to the diabolical proposal to destroy
all existing Hebrew literature, the Scriptures alone excepted. He had
defended himself in a book entitled the _Speculum Oculare_ (the
Eyeglass), and on a mandate being issued by Hoogstraaten to burn this,
Reuchlin had appealed from the Inquisition to the pope. The Bishop of
Speyer, to whom Leo committed the case, gave judgment in favour of
Reuchlin and imposed on his enemies perpetual silence, a sentence
which proved difficult of execution. Reuchlin was condemned by the
universities of Mayence, Erfurt, Louvain, and Paris, although there
were at the time professorships of Hebrew both in Louvain and in Paris.
The matter was in some fashion again brought before the pope, to whom
an earnest and eloquent appeal was made by Erasmus on behalf of his
friend. The support of the Emperor Maximilian was also secured for
the aged scholar who had done so much to bring honour to the cause
of learning in Germany and in Europe. The pope finally confirmed the
previous decision in favour of Reuchlin, a decision which rescued from
the status of heresy, in which it had been placed by the Dominicans and
the learned faculties of the universities, the language of the Hebrew
Scriptures and the literature of the chosen people of God. Reuchlin’s
books were rescued from the ban and their learned author was saved from
the risk of the stake.[221]

The _Colloquies_ of Erasmus were published in 1518, and were reprinted
in a long series of editions authorised and unauthorised. One printer
in Paris, learning that the university was about to condemn the work,
brought into circulation no less than twenty thousand copies.[222] This
constitutes a curious example of the influence that could be exerted by
an official condemnation in bringing about for the work an immediate
and extended demand for a book. The writings of Erasmus were condemned
_in toto_, in 1550, in the Spanish Index of that date.

In 1539, the interest of Francis in scholarship, and the influence
of Budaeus caused him to invite Erasmus to Paris to take part in the
organisation of a royal college. The Emperor (Charles V) put an end
to the negotiation by forbidding Erasmus (under the penalty of the
stoppage of his pension) to leave the territory of the empire. It is
interesting to think of the most Catholic Emperor on the one hand,
and the “eldest son of the Church” on the other, contending for the
services of the scholar whose writings had been condemned in Rome as
heretical and were prohibited in Spain, and who could not at this time
obtain from the Paris University a printing-privilege.

Among the cultivated Spaniards assembled at the court of Charles V,
Erasmus became for the time the fashion. His writings secured the
approval even of some of the highest dignitaries of the Spanish Church.
The Inquisitor-General, Manrique, declared Erasmus to be another
Jerome and Augustine. The Archbishop of Toledo wrote, when Erasmus was
under criticism, assuring him of the protection and good-will of the
emperor. The _Colloquies_ were used as a schoolbook and the _Praise
of Folly_ was in the hands of all Humanists. In March, 1527, Valdes
wrote to Erasmus that his books were everywhere in Spain and that no
merchandise was more salable.[223] In 1527 was published a Castilian
version of the _Manual of the Christian Soldier_, and in the same
year, under the leadership of Dr. Edward Lee, English ambassador in
Spain, a session of the supreme council of the Inquisition was called
to make thorough examination of the alleged heresies in the writings
of Erasmus. A list of twenty-one such heresies was framed by the
examiners. The charges were finally referred to an assembly of twenty
theologians and nine friars who gave to the investigation months of
debate, but who arrived at no conclusion. Charles V was persuaded to
write an imperial missive in favour of Erasmus, and Clement VII issued,
in 1527, a brief imposing silence on all who should attack the writings
in so far as these concerned Luther. Manrique issued, on behalf of the
Spanish Inquisition, an absolute prohibition of any writings against
Erasmus. The influence of the antagonists of Erasmus finally, however,
prevailed. In 1535, a year before the death of the author, Charles V
made it a capital offence to use the _Colloquies_ in schools, and in
1538 he issued a prohibition covering the _Praise of Folly_ and most
of the other works, excepting, however, the _Christian Soldier_. In
the Spanish expurgatory Index of 1584, Erasmus occupies no less than
fifty-five quarto pages. By 1640, the list of the errors of Erasmus
calls for no less than fifty-nine folio pages in double columns. By
this time he had come to be classed with the incorrigible heretics, and
the words “_auctoris damnati_” are ordered to be inserted after his
name on all title-pages. This was the final judgment of the Spanish
Inquisition on Erasmus. A different view of the nature and value of the
work done by Erasmus is taken by Catholic scholars of the twentieth
century, although I do not venture to say that this view is general,
even among the scholars of the Church. Father Shahan, of the Catholic
University of America, for instance, says (in 1899) (speaking to be
sure informally):

   “Erasmus rendered noteworthy service to the Church, to religion,
   and to scholarship. He was the counsellor of moderation, the
   upholder of scholarly standards, the pitiless critic and the
   courageous antagonist of fraud and of folly.”


=2. Luther.=--It is with the work of Luther that there begins to be a
large production and a wide distribution of books in German. Up to this
time the undertakings of the German printers had been restricted almost
exclusively to books in Latin. The immediate distribution, however, of
the writings of Luther and his associates, not only among the trade
folk and working people of the towns, but through the rural districts,
constitutes an evidence that the general intelligence and the education
of the mass of the people had reached a much higher development than
the Protestant historians of the time have been willing to admit. It is
to be remembered that the readers whom Luther was reaching belonged to
the generation which had depended for its education exclusively upon
the monastery schools, or upon schools which were entirely under the
direction of the priests. The work of the reformers was essentially a
work of argument, and it could have been carried on successfully only
with people who were intelligent enough to understand arguments whether
presented orally or in print. That the community was as intelligent
and as receptive as proved to be the case, shows how exaggerated and
ill-considered are the conclusions presented by Protestant historians
represented by D’Aubigné, Robertson, and others in regard to the
absolute ignorance in which the Catholic teachers had left their
followers. Kapp reports that of Luther’s treatise on German theology
no less than seventy editions were printed between the years 1518 and
1854. Of the _Address to the German Nobility_, four thousand copies
were sold in five days. Of the first edition of the New Testament,
printed in Wittenberg in 1522, five thousand copies were sold within
three months. There seems to have been no question that the emphasis
given by the imperial and ecclesiastical censorship to the importance
of Luther’s writings constituted an important factor in bringing these
to the attention of the public, and in securing for them the largest
possible circulation.

Luther realised that, with hardly an exception, the scholarly divines
of the university were antagonistic to him and to his work. He writes
February 8, 1516: _Nec cessant universitates bonos libros cremare et
damnare, rursum malos dictare, imo somniare_.[224]

In 1519, the doctors of Louvain published an edict ordering the
burning of all copies that could be secured of the writings of Luther.
A similar order was issued in 1520 by the divines of Cologne. Both
orders were printed in Wittenberg, in 1520, by Melchior Lottherus.
In 1521, the theological faculty of Paris issued an edict entitled
_Determinationes Theologicae Facultatis Parisien. super Doctrina
Lutheriana_. The edict, which was printed in Wittenberg in the
same year, condemns a number of propositions from the treatise _De
Captivitate Babylonica_. The theological facility of Cologne issued,
in 1532, a censure against the _Epitome of Abuses by a Reformed
Monk_.[225]

In 1520, Cardinal Wolsey (in consequence of the Bull of Leo X
against Luther, issued July 17th of that year) directed the English
bishops to require that all the books and writings of one Martin
Luther (_cujusdam M. L._) should be delivered up by all persons
possessing them, under pain of the greater excommunication.[226]

In 1522, Luther brought into print his famous German version of the
New Testament; he printed of this a first impression of five thousand
copies and three months later a second impression of the same number.
The Bull of Leo X excommunicating Luther, issued in 1520, condemned his
works individually and collectively. The existing copies are ordered
to be burned and all persons are prohibited, under severe penalties,
from printing, selling, distributing, or possessing any of Luther’s
writings. The immediate effect of this Bull was to bring about a
largely increased sale throughout Germany for everything that Luther
had written, and to cause also a considerable demand for these writings
in other countries. Köstlin estimates that by 1521 more than one
hundred impressions had been printed of the German versions of Luther’s
sermons and tracts. In 1564, the restrictions upon the publishers
in regard to the printing of the Lutheran version of the Bible were
removed and, at the instance of the Duke of Weimer, this version became
common property (_literärisches Gemeingut_) for all Germany and was
formally declared free of privilege.

The circulation of the Lutheran tracts was taken charge of not only by
the book-pedlars and colporteurs but by a large number of travelling
preachers, _Prädikanten_. These “preachers” were in part old-time
priests, but in many cases laymen of varying degrees of education or
of ignorance. During the troublous times of the war of the peasants,
the progress of the Reformation was checked and the circulation of the
Lutheran publications in the districts affected by the uprising was for
the time brought to a close.

The downfall of imperial Rome which (irrespective of the internal
causes) was brought about by persistent Teutonic onslaughts, terminated
the period of the world’s history which is, for convenience, called
classic or ancient. In like manner, the overthrow of the world-wide
domination of ecclesiastical Rome was brought about by the Teuton
Luther, an attack which, supported by the Teutonic forces of North
Europe, developed into a revolution against Italian rule, and
terminated the epoch of mediaevalism. For long periods to come, the
questions raised by Luther and his fellow-Protestants were to bring
anxieties and conflicts upon popes, emperors, princes, and people.
These questions were also to provide issues and themes for innumerable
writers, and to secure an apparently inexhaustible supply of material
for the printing-presses and the booksellers. It is not surprising that
at an early period in the development of printing, ecclesiastics who
were fighting for the continued domination of the Church recognised
the press as a most seriously antagonistic influence, and that, during
a term of two centuries, they continued to attempt to put into force
machinery for the supervision and restriction of its undertakings. A
scholarly American Catholic (speaking in 1905) makes reference to “the
distinctive service rendered by Luther in making clear to the Church
the necessity for reform, for recurrences to the earlier Christian
ideals, to the standards of Gregory the Great and of Benedict.”




                              CHAPTER XVI

                THE JANSENIST CONTROVERSY AND THE BULL
                              UNIGENITUS

    1. The Jansenist Controversy                        1641–1649.
    2. Quesnel and the Bull _Unigenitus_                1671–1755.
    3. Controversial Writings on Theological Morality   1667–1730.


=1. The Jansenist Controversy, 1641–1649.=--In 1641, was condemned
by the Inquisition the _Augustinus_ of Cornelius Jansen, Bishop
of Yprés, which had been published in the same year, three years after
the death of its author. The treatise was, it seems, classed among the
writings having to do with the prohibited subject _de auxiliis_.

The _Augustinus seu doctrina S. Augustini de humanae naturae sanitate,
aegritudine et medicina, adversus Pelagianas et Massilienses_, was
published in 1640, in three volumes folio. The first is devoted to a
historical exposition of the Pelagian and Massilian (semi-Pelagian)
heresies; the second sets forth the Augustinian doctrine as to the
state of innocence and the fallen state; while the third treats, in ten
books, of the grace of Christ. The sting of the work is to be found in
the epilogue, which draws a parallel in various particulars between
the errors of the Massilians and those _recentiorum quorumdam_, the
reference being to the Jesuits. In 1641, the book was prohibited by the
Inquisition, but no opinion was pronounced as to its doctrine, and the
answering treatises of the Jesuits were also condemned.

In March, 1642, a Bull of Urban VIII confirms this decree of the
Inquisition in spite of the continued pressure on the part of the
divines of Louvain to secure a modification of the original judgment.

In 1643, Urban VIII published the Bull _In eminenti_, renewing and
confirming the constitutions of Pius V and Gregory XIII and the
decree of Paul V, and forbidding the reading of the _Augustinus_. The
publication of this Bull resulted in the production by Arnauld, in 1644
and in 1645, of _Apologies for Jansen_, and was also the text for the
famous _Provincial Letters_ of Pascal, which appeared in 1656.

In 1651, eighty-five French bishops made representations in Rome
calling for the specific condemnation of five propositions contained
in the treatise of Jansen. A statement was made a little later by
certain other bishops pointing out that the propositions in question
were open to a different interpretation from that named in the original
complaint. The matter was referred to a special congregation of four
cardinals, by whom it was again referred to a commission of thirteen
theologians selected by the Inquisition. This second commission gave
permission to the two parties to submit, in writing or in person,
further arguments in regard to the matter at issue. In May, 1653,
Innocent X condemned, in a Bull, the five propositions.

The text of the five propositions is as follows:

1. There are some commandments of God which just men, although willing
and anxious to obey them, are unable with the strength they have to
fulfil, and the grace by which they might fulfil them is also wanting.

2. In the state of fallen nature, inward grace is never resisted.

3. In the fallen state, merit and demerit do not depend on a liberty
which excludes necessity, but on a liberty which excludes constraint.

4. The semi-Pelagians admitted the necessity of an inward prevenient
grace for the performance of each particular act, and also for the
first act of faith, and yet were heretical inasmuch as they maintained
that this grace was of such a nature that the will of man was able
either to resist or to obey it.

5. It is semi-Pelagian to say that Christ died or shed his blood for
all men without exception.

In the Bull of May, 1653, _Cum occasione impressionis libri_, Innocent
X pronounced the first four propositions to be heretical, while the
fifth was declared to be false, with the addition that if it was
intended to convey the meaning that Christ died only for the elect, it
was impious and blasphemous as well as heretical.

The Jansenists expressed themselves as willing to accept the authority
of the Pope in condemning the five propositions in their heretical
sense, but contended that these propositions had not been identified
with the teachings of Jansen. In September, 1654, the Pope declared
that the propositions were found in the _Augustinus_ of Jansen, and
that their condemnation as doctrines of Jansen was imperative. Arnauld
and his associates in Port Royal contended that, while the Holy See had
authority to decide with respect to doctrine, and every good Catholic
owed submission to such papal decisions, yet the See might be mistaken
on a question of fact, such for instance as to whether a given book
contained certain statements. The fullest account of the condemnation
of the Jansenist doctrines is given by De Placette.[227]

In a decree of the Inquisition, issued in April, 1654, and cited in
a brief of Innocent of the same year, all writings are specifically
condemned which present and defend the doctrine contained in the
_Augustinus_ of Jansen.

In 1657, this general prohibition was renewed and it stands in the
later Indexes under the term _libri_, and, since Benedict XIV, in the
_Decreta Gen._, ii, 5. During the rule of Alexander VII (1655–1667)
the question again arose whether on the ground of the Bull of 1653
it was necessary to conclude that Jansen really had taught the five
propositions in the sense in which they had been condemned. Arnauld,
writing in 1655, took the ground that the Bull in no way decided this
matter of the actual interpretation of the propositions, but decided
simply that certain doctrine said to be contained in these propositions
was itself to be condemned. It was Arnauld’s contention, therefore,
that for devout believers a respectful silence (_silence respectueux_)
concerning the issue ought to be observed. One result of Arnauld’s
statement was his expulsion from the Sorbonne, which was followed by
the publication of the famous _Letters_ of Pascal. In October, 1656,
Alexander VII issued a Bull declaring that the five propositions had
been correctly cited from the book of Jansen, and that the sense in
which they had been condemned was the sense that the author had in
his mind at the time of their writing. In this Bull, the Pope appears
to make the claim, in regard to matters of dogma, of being able to
determine the motives and the absolute purpose by which an author has
been actuated in putting a statement into words.

From this time on, the main question turns upon the range or extent of
the authority of the Church and particularly of the infallibility (in
this matter of interpretation) of the pope. In a Bull of 1656, issued
by Alexander VII as a result of an understanding with Louis XIV, it is
ordered that all bishops, priests, monks, and nuns shall subscribe to a
formula of which the following is the substance:

   “I accept in full the authority of the Bull of Innocent X of May
   31, 1653, and the Bull of Alexander VII of October, 1656, and
   I reject and condemn without reservation the five propositions
   referred to in these Bulls cited from the _Augustinus_ of
   Jansen, in the sense which the author intended should be given
   to said propositions, in which sense said propositions have been
   condemned by the Holy See. I solemnly swear to abide by this
   statement, so help me God and the holy Apostles.”

Four French bishops gave out in June, 1665, statements in which they
declared that this formula was to be subscribed to with reservation
in regard to the actual facts of doctrine contained in the series
of papal bulls. These diocesan letters were themselves, in January,
1667, prohibited by the Congregation of the Index. The negotiations
of the pope with the French Government in regard to further action
against the four bishops was interrupted by the death in May, 1667, of
Alexander VII. Under Alexander’s successor, Clement IX, an agreement
was arrived at, the so-called “Peace of Clement,” by which the four
bishops gave their signatures to the formula and addressed a memorial
to the pope, stating that they were now prepared to condemn the five
propositions without reservation of any kind in the sense in which
these propositions had already been condemned by the Holy See. During
the next ten years, the subscription to the formula was very generally
made throughout France, with the same specific statement as that given
by the four bishops to the pope. In this manner was finally brought to
a close the Jansenist issue. In connection with this controversy, were
placed upon the Index the titles of some hundred books, monographs,
and pamphlets, chiefly by French authors. The list includes no less
than twenty writings of Arnauld. The Spanish Index of 1707 contains
the condemnation of the original work of Jansen, and of the five
propositions, together with a general prohibition of all writings
supporting these propositions. These hundred titles constituted but
a very small fragment of the enormous mass of literature that was
brought into print in France, in Holland, and in North Germany as a
result of the controversy. One work, especially characteristic of the
spirit of the time, may deserve more specific mention; the calendar for
1654, issued by certain Jesuits under the title of _La Déroute et
la confusion des Jansénistes_, contains a frontispiece on copper;
giving on the one side a view of the pope surrounded by cardinals
and prelates and a flash of lightning striking in front of the group
at a hydra with five heads (the five propositions); on the other
side of the plate is seated on a throne Louis XIV, to whom Justice
tenders the sword. Below is a representation of Jansen with the wings
of a bat, flying into the arms of Calvin and other heresiarchs who
stand surrounded by monstrosities representing error, ignorance, and
dissipation. This group has, like the hydra, been struck by the flash
of lightning emanating from the pope. The calendar was placed upon
the Index, which did not prevent it from securing a wide circulation.
Reusch speaks of a distribution during the first year of fourteen
thousand copies.

_Writings of the Jansenists. 1571–1711._ In 1571, Pius V condemned
in a separate prohibition a French version of the _Officium pavum
B. M. V._ that had been prepared by one of the theologians of
Port-Royal. In 1661, Alexander VII issued a brief condemning in very
sharp terms a French version of the Book of the Mass, prohibiting also
in general terms all editions in the vernacular of the Book of the
Mass. In 1695, was prohibited a volume by Le Tourneaux, _L’Année
Chrétienne_, because its text included a French version of the
prayers of the Mass. A later prohibition of translations of the prayers
of the Mass which had been accepted by the Jansenists, although evoking
protests from the French bishops, was recalled. Benedict XIV recalled
also the prohibition of Alexander VII which had been issued in 1661,
with the general wording _Missale Romanum e Latino idiomate ad
Gallicam vulgarem linguam conversum et typis evulgatum_. In 1668,
a brief of Clement IX prohibits a translation of the New Testament
which had been prepared by one of the divines of Port-Royal and
which was known as the New Testament of Mons. This prohibition was,
however, expressly limited to the edition in question, probably on
the ground of certain of the notes contained in it. Clement does not
undertake any general prohibition of editions in the vernacular of
the Bible. In 1674, was prohibited a treatise issued under the title
of _Monita Salutaria D. M. V._ This contains an argument against
certain abuses that had arisen in the worship of Mary. It was sharply
assailed by the Jesuits and was defended by most of the opponents
of Jesuitism. There also found their way into the Index a series of
later publications written to maintain the views of the _Monita_,
including a treatise by Bailliet. A volume by Bailliet, presenting
a study of the Saints, was prohibited on the express ground that
it was hypocritical in character. Bailliet had undertaken in his
biographies of the Saints to distinguish between the miracles and
stories which were to be accepted, and others of which in his judgment
the records were untrustworthy. Benedict XIV presents the conclusion
that Bailliet had gone too far with his criticisms. He says[228]:
_Homo vel certissimarum rerum veritatum, ut intemporenti ingenio
est, sollicitans_. The Bishop Gapi, in 1711, prohibits the entire
work on the ground that a number of dogmas and disciplinary articles
were considered in it in a Jansenist or even a Protestant sense. The
prohibitions had the effect, as was usually the case, of increasing the
repute and the circulation of the work, which was repeatedly reprinted.

A treatise by Antoine Arnauld on frequent communion, published in 1643,
was promptly denounced by the Inquisition although it had secured the
approval of the French bishops. In 1645, the Abbé Bourgois succeeded
in securing a cancellation of the judgment of the Inquisition. A
century later, a Jesuit reply to Arnauld’s treatise, written by Pichon,
came into the Index. In 1647, the Inquisition prohibited a volume by
Martin de Bircos written in support of the doctrines presented by
Arnauld. Martin speaks of the Apostles Peter and Paul as the “two
leaders” of the early Church, which constituted the chief ground for
the condemnation of the book, the authorities maintaining that the
subordination of Paul to Peter was the only sound doctrine. Since the
time of Benedict XIV, a general prohibition stands in the _Decreta
Gen._ under the term _libri_, of all writings maintaining any
opinion adverse to the supremacy of Peter.

_Controversies Connected with the Jansenist Contests._ During the
17th century, were prohibited a number of writings appearing outside
of France and the Netherlands, which, while not classed directly as
Jansenist, were concerned with the doctrine of Grace. In 1673, a
treatise by the Augustine Noris (who was made a cardinal in 1695,
and who died in 1704) on Pelagianism and the doctrine of Grace, was
repeatedly condemned by the Jesuits and the Franciscans as containing
Jansenist heresies. The volume was brought to Rome for investigation
three times, and each time was declared to be sound in its orthodoxy. A
number of other works which were denounced before the Roman authorities
by the Jesuit leaders, on the ground of containing Jansenist heresies,
the Congregation refused to condemn. The authors were in large part
Dominicans and Augustinians who had brought into print the traditionary
doctrine of Grace as taught in their own schools. Cardinal Bona
complained that during these years every one who was not a Molinist
was denounced by the Jesuits as a Jansenist. The Spanish Dominican,
Gonzalez de Rosende, and the French Oratorian Jeunin, are the only
theologians of note who come into the Roman Index during this period.
The Congregation condemned, in 1722, a censure of the faculty of Douay
in which the Dominicans, Contenso and Massoulié, had been accused of
being Jansenists. The edition of the work of St. Augustine, edited
by the Benedictines of St. Maur, was accused of being tainted with
Jansenism, but the work succeeded in securing the approval of the
Roman authorities. In 1704, a brief of Clement XI condemned a volume
by Launoy, printed after the author’s death, in which the Augustinian
doctrine of Grace was sharply opposed. A brief of Clement IX, in 1668,
condemned the edition of the New Testament printed in Mons, the editors
of which were charged with Jansenism.

_La Bibliothèque Janséniste._ In 1722, the Jesuit Dominique de
Colonia, published under the title _Bibliothèque Janséniste_
a schedule of writings which the Jesuits classed as Jansenist in
doctrine. The list includes the titles of a number of works which had
not been prohibited in the Roman Indexes. In the Spanish Index of 1747,
is included as an appendix this schedule of De Colonia reprinted from
the second edition of his work. In both lists is included the title of
a treatise by Cardinal Noris which, while more than once denounced in
Rome, had, after repeated examinations, secured from the authorities
a final approval. Application was made in 1748 by Benedict XIV to the
inquisitor-general of Spain to cancel the condemnation of the treatise
by Noris. This request received at the outset no consideration, but in
connection with a later personal appeal from the Pope to the King of
Spain, the condemnation was rescinded in 1758.

The _Bibliothèque Janséniste_ was, in 1749, prohibited by the
Congregation of the Index. In 1750, were prohibited the _Pasquille_
written by the Jesuit, Ricchini, secretary of the Congregation.
In 1752, Patouillet published a largely extended edition of the
Bibliothèque under the title _Dictionnaire des Livres Jansénistes_. In
this edition, the name of Noris was omitted, but there were included a
number of works which, after examination had been approved in Rome,
such as for instance the treatises by the Augustinians, Bellelli and
Berti. This _Dictionnaire_ was prohibited in 1754.

_Pascal and Arnauld concerning the Morality of the Jesuits._ The famous
_Letters_ of Pascal, which were issued in 1656 without the name of
the author, were promptly prohibited by the Inquisition in 1657. The
title of the book has been continued in later Indexes in the class
of anonymous writings. Certain defences of their doctrines against
the assaults of Pascal published by the Jesuits, were themselves
prohibited. The most noteworthy of this group of Jesuit replies were
the treatises by Pirot and Daniel. A Latin edition of the Pascal
_Letters_, published a year or two later under the name of Wendrockius,
was not prohibited, while a reply to the same, published under the
name of Stubockius, was placed on the Index. The essay by Arnauld,
printed in 1643 under the title of _Théologie Morale du Jesuit_,
can be considered as a precursor of the Pascal _Letters_. In 1669
and 1683, were printed the first two volumes of a work entitled _Le
Morale pratique des Jesuits_, which was written by the Abbé de Pont
Château. During the years 1689–1695, five additional volumes were
issued under the same title, which were the work of Arnauld. The first
two were prohibited but the last five escaped condemnation. In 1700,
was prohibited the _Teatro Jesuitico_, a monograph written against
the Jesuits by Le Tellier, which had been published forty-six years
earlier. One matter which receives in these volumes of Arnauld a large
measure of attention, the contest between the Jesuits and Bishop
Palafox, was the subject during both the 17th and 18th centuries of a
large amount of controversial writing, and plays an important part
in the Spanish Index. A decree in the Roman Index of 1656 orders
eliminated from one volume of the Lyons edition of the Bellarmin six
pages which give the Jesuitical view of the decision presented in the
brief of Innocent X concerning this matter of Palafox. Palafox, who was
a Dominican, had been a bishop in Mexico, but in 1653, became Bishop
of Osma where he died in 1659. It was in Osma that he came into issue
with the Spanish Jesuits and, in 1649, he presented to Innocent X a
formidable brief or complaint against Jesuit theory and practice. In
1648, the Pope gave a decision in favour of the Bishop.

_Contests in the Netherlands, 1690–1712._ The contest in the
Netherlands between the Jansenist and the Jesuit parties in the
Church became active after Precipiano, heretofore Bishop of Bruges,
had, in 1690, become Archbishop of Mechlin. In 1690, he attempted
in union with the other bishops, to put into shape a formula or
declaration which went far in advance of that issued by Alexander
VII. Innocent XII, in a brief issued in February, 1695, ordered that
subscriptions should be required only for the formula of Alexander
VII and that demand should be made, on the part of those giving this
subscription, for the condemnation of the famous propositions taken
from the book of Jansen in their obvious or essential meaning (_in
sensu obvio_) without reference to the sense that may have been
intended by the author (_in sensu ab auctore intento_). At the
same time, the Pope ordered that no further references should be made
in regard to the interpretation of the formula or the matter of the
five propositions, and the bishops were prohibited from making such
question or requirement of interpretation a ground for the exclusion
from office or from functions of any ecclesiastics, or that on the same
ground any ecclesiastic should be classed as a Jansenist. This decision
may be considered as a confirmation of the “Peace of Clement IX.” At
this time were prohibited a number of writings containing denunciations
of Belgian Jansenists, and a number of other controversial writings,
including a treatise by the Jesuit, Jacques de la Fontaine, who was
the confessor of Archbishop Precipiano. Precipiano on his part, in a
decree of January, 1695, undertook to prohibit Jansenist writings,
and he secured in this year orders from the King of Spain (Charles
II) under which all those suspected of Jansenist doctrines were to be
ruled out of office whether ecclesiastical or civil. As a result of
fresh complaints presented in Rome, Innocent XII issues in July, 1696,
a second brief confirming the earlier one and declaring specifically
that no modifications should be made in the terms of the Bull or of
the formula of Alexander VII. In the years succeeding, there continued
to be placed in the Index, apparently for the purpose of checking
the controversy, a number of writings against the Jansenists. The
list of writers includes Palazol and Desirant. In 1703, Precipiano
took fresh action against the Jansenists--Gerberon and Quesnel who,
since the death of Arnauld (in August, 1694) were held as the leaders
among the French Jansenists in Belgium, were arrested under the
authority of the Roman Inquisition and of the Spanish Government, were
tried and were declared to have fallen under excommunication. There
came into the Index lists, in connection with this later outbreak,
controversial writings by Opstraet, Henricus a. S., Ignatio, and Fr.
Martin. In January, 1695, Bishop Precipiano published, in the form
of a diocesan decree, a small Index of his own which was devoted
entirely to Jansenist writings. The sixty titles in the lists include
various treatises of Arnauld, Huygens, Quesnel, Gilles de Witte, and
a number of anonymous controversial monographs. In Rome, no attention
was paid to this Index, and a remonstrance printed by Quesnel was
not even prohibited. Precipiano prohibits the reading, copying, or
distribution of a letter addressed to him in February, 1694, by
Hennevel, which letter concerned itself with the matter of the formula.
The Inquisition condemned this letter on the ground of the disobedience
of the instructions of the pope for silence in regard to the subject
and also because of certain ill-advised expressions, and Hennevel was
a few months later compelled to retract his utterance. A letter of
Precipiano, addressed to the court at Madrid, and written in 1695, says:

   “It is impossible to rout out Jansenists from the Netherlands
   unless the King accomplishes this through his own authority.
   From Rome under the present Pope nothing is to be hoped. He
   himself will do nothing and he leaves the responsibility to
   the Congregations which were demanded by Cardinal Casanoti and
   Bernini who are protectors of the Jansenist heresies.”[229]

Arnauld, who may be classed as among the most important of the
defenders of Jansenism, died in 1694. Very few of his writings had
escaped the prohibition of the Index but the Memoirs of him written by
Quesnel, _Histoire de la vie et des ouvrages de Monsieur Arnauld_,
printed in 1695, escaped condemnation. As late as 1704, however, was
prohibited the treatise by Arnauld entitled _Instructions sur la
Grâce selon l’écriture et les pères, avec l’exposition de la foire de
l’Eglise Romaine touchant la Grâce et la predestination_.

_The Church of Utrecht._ The issues between the two great divisions
of Church opinion which were classed, speaking briefly, as Jansenist
and Jesuit, were active also in Holland, although in that country
the Catholic Church had a comparatively small group of followers and
the direct Jesuit influence was itself inconsiderable. In Holland as
in England, the question arose as to whether Catholics residing in
Protestant lands were properly subject to local bishops or to Apostolic
vicars. In England, during a series of centuries, Apostolic vicars
had exercised the control over the faithful and the larger number
of the English Catholics did not come into relations with any local
bishops. In Holland, however, the hierarchy of the Church had never
been entirely destroyed. There remained, for instance, in active
existence chapters by which were elected archbishops of Utrecht who
exercised control over the Catholics in the five suffragan bishoprics
for which, since the Reformation, no suffragan had been appointed. It
was contended on the one hand that these archbishops retained the full
authority of the office, even in the cases in which the office was
held not by the Archbishop of Utrecht but by an official taking his
title from a foreign bishopric or archbishopric; on the other hand,
the view was maintained that since the Reformation, Holland possessed
the character of a mission land and that the archbishop possessed the
functions only of an Apostolic vicar. These issues brought about a
formal breach between those holding the two sets of opinions, when,
in 1702, Clement XI deposed the Archbishop, Peter Codde, and named
as Apostolic-vicar Theodor Cock. The latter was not permitted by
the Government of Holland to make his residence in the country and
the supervision of the “Dutch Mission” was therefore transferred to
the nuncius in Cologne. The chapters in Holland protested against
this measure and, after 1724, they elected in unbroken succession
archbishops of Utrecht who, between 1742 and 1758, made appointments of
bishops for the dioceses of Haarlem and Deventer. The breach was still
further widened because the Chapters of Utrecht and Haarlem and the
ecclesiastics belonging to these dioceses appealed for a decision of
a general council of the Church, not only in regard to the particular
papal measures above specified, but also on the ground of the Bull
_Unigenitus_. In 1707, were prohibited in a brief of Clement XI a long
series of works by Dutch writers having to do with the deposition of
Archbishop Codde and, later in the year, came also into the Index a
number of further treatises written in defence of the claim of the
Church of Utrecht. The most important works of this group were those
of the Louvain jurist, van Espen, whose _Jus ecclesiasticum_ was
prohibited in 1704 and whose name came into the Index in 1734 connected
with his entire series of writings.

=2. The Bull Unigenitus.=--Pasquier Quesnel (1634–1719) published in
1671, the first part of his _Commentary on the New Testament_. The
completed work was prohibited in 1708, in a brief of Clement XI. In
1675, Quesnel published an edition of the works of Leo the Great, the
notes to which he utilised for a defence of Gallican liberties. This
work was placed on the Index in 1676. In 1685, finding himself unable
to subscribe to a document in condemnation of Jansenism, Quesnel
retired from Orleans to Brussels. There, as a result in part of his
association with Arnauld, he completed, in 1695, under the title of
_Reflexions Morales sur le Nouveau Testament_, the _Commentary_, the
first part of which had been issued in 1671.

At the instance of Louis XIV, Clement issued in September, 1713, the
Bull _Unigenitus_ in which the condemnation of the Commentary of
Quesnel is confirmed and a hundred and one propositions selected from
the Commentary are specifically condemned. In the case of a number
of these propositions, no specification is given in the Bull for the
ground of their disapproval, and it was contended by the supporters of
Quesnel that it was not possible to point out in these any utterance of
heresy or of unsound doctrine.

The following propositions may be cited as representing the character
of the series:

_79. Utile, et necessarium est omni tempore, omni loco, et omni
personarum generi studere, et cognoscere spiritum, pietatem, et
mysteria Sacrae Scripturae_ (It is useful and necessary at all
times, in every place, and for every sort of person, to study and know
the spirit, the piety, and the mysteries of Holy Scripture).

_80. Lectis Sacrae Scripturae est pro omnibus_ (The reading of Holy
Scripture is for all).

_81. Obscuritas sancta Verbi Dei non est laicis ratio dispensandi se
ipsos ab ejus lectione_ (The sacred obscurity of the Word of God is
no reason for the laity to absolve themselves from the reading of it).

_82. Dies Dominicus a Christianis debet sanctificari lectionibus
pietatis, et super omnia Sanctarum Scripturarum. Damnosum est velle
Christianum ab hac lectione retrahere._ (The Lord’s day should be
kept holy by Christians by pious reading, and above all by the reading
of Holy Scripture. It is hurtful for a Christian to wish to withdraw
from such readings).

_83. Est illusio, sibi persuadere, quod notitia Mysteriorum Religionis
non debeat communicari foeminis, lectione sacrorum librorum. Non ex
foeminarum simplicitate, sed ex superba Virorum scientia, ortus est
Scripturarum abusus, et natae sunt haereses._ (It is a mistake to
believe that knowledge of the mysteries of religion ought not to be
communicated to women by the reading of the holy books. Not from the
simplicity of women, but from the haughty science of men has the abuse
of the Scriptures arisen and have heresies been born.)

_84. Abripere e Christianorum manibus Novum Testamentum, seu eis illud
clausum tenere, auferendo eis modum illud intelligendi, est illis
Christi os obturare_ (To tear the New Testament from the hands of
Christians or to keep it closed to them by depriving them of this mode
of understanding, is to stop for them the mouth of Christ).

_85. Interdicere Christianis lectionem Sacrae Scripturae, praesertim
Evangelii, est interdicere usum luminis filiis lucis, et facere ut
patiantur speciem quondam excommunicationis_ (To forbid Christians
the reading of Holy Scripture, especially of the Gospel, is to forbid
the use of light to the children of light, and to make them suffer a
certain form of excommunication).[230]

The Bull was accepted and published by the Parliament of Paris and by
a majority of the faculty of the Sorbonne, and it was also published
in the dioceses in the greater number of the bishoprics. The Cardinal
Noailles, Archbishop of Paris, in making publication of the Bull, gives
his general approval with certain reservations which were held by the
Holy See to be invidious and as tending to schism. The Cardinal’s brief
was itself condemned by the Inquisition. After the death of Louis XIV
(September, 1715), the theological faculties of the Sorbonne and of the
French universities made open declaration against the Bull, and no less
than thirty bishops declared that they had accepted the Bull only on
condition of certain reservations and explanations. The bishops made
applications to the Regent to secure from the pope an interpretation of
the full purport of the hundred and one propositions and an explanation
of the precise grounds for the condemnation of these. In 1717, four of
the French bishops made appeal to the general council for a decision
in the matter. Later, other bishops, including Cardinal Noailles and a
number of ecclesiastics and laymen, united in this appeal. This group
were given the name of Appellants and their opponents were called
Acceptants or constitutionals. The question as to whether the hundred
and one propositions were or were not heretical or erroneous, fell more
and more into the background and the issue finally took the shape as
to whether a dogmatic Bull was to be accepted as a final decision of
questions of doctrine, and whether such Bull was to be obeyed as an
infallible and final judgment. The pope, however, so far from modifying
in any way the decision presented in the original Bull, re-emphasised
his position in a second Bull issued in 1719. In this, he presents the
conclusion that the condemnation of the propositions was in itself
final and authoritative and demanded from the Church unquestioning
obedience. In 1720, an understanding was arrived at under which
certain of the Appellants recalled their signatures to the original
application while others repeated the first contention. These latter
came to be known as Re-appellants.

In 1722, seven French bishops appealed to Innocent XIII to revoke
the Bull and to summon a general council. Their letter was formally
condemned by the Inquisition. Benedict XIII, in a Bull issued in
1724, declares that the doctrines of St. Augustine and St. Thomas
Aquinas are not affected by the Bull _Unigenitus_. The Pope was
personally inclined to enter into further explanations or definitions
of the purport of the Bull, but a provincial council, held in Rome
in 1725, had taken the ground that the Bull was to be accepted as a
rule of faith, and, in 1727, the Pope confirmed the proceedings of a
provincial council held at Embrunn, at which council Bishop Soanen of
Sénez, one of the most active of the Appellants, had been suspended.
As a result of this action of the council and of the approval given to
the same by the Pope, the open opposition to the Bull on the part of
the French bishops was for the time brought to a close, and in 1730,
the faculty of the Sorbonne also gave in its submission. In 1734, the
Dominican, Serry, published anonymously, under the title _Theologia
Supplex_, an analysis of the purport of the Bull, with reference
more particularly to the condemnation of certain of the one hundred and
one propositions in which it had not proved practicable to indicate any
heretical teaching. This treatise was promptly prohibited, as had been
done with Serry’s previous volume on papal infallibility.

A letter of the Duchess of Orleans (Elizabeth Charlotte of the
Palatinate) written during the last years of Louis XIV, contains the
following reference to the Bull:

   “_On avait fait au Roi une telle peur de l’enfer, qu’il
   croyait que tout ceux qui n’avaient pas été instruits par les
   Jesuites étaient damnés, et qu’il cragnait d’être damné aussi
   s’il les fréquentait. Quand on voulait perdre quel qu’un,
   on n’avait qu’à dire: il est Huguenot ou Janséniste; alors
   l’affaire était faite._ The Maréchal d’Harcourt says that a
   Jansenist is nothing else than a man that one desires to hang as
   quickly as possible.”[231]

After 1731, the Parliament of Paris took action antagonistic to the
position of the so-called Curialist bishops (the bishops who had
given their adhesion to the full contentions of the Holy See) more
particularly with reference to the policy pursued by these bishops
in refusing to the Appellants the privilege of the sacraments and of
burial in consecrated ground. The bishops had question among themselves
in regard to the recognition of the authority of the Parliament to take
action in a matter so purely ecclesiastical, and they made application
to Rome for instructions. In a brief issued in October, 1756, Benedict
XIV decided that the sacraments should be denied only to the more
strenuous and noteworthy of the opponents of the Bull. This decision
caused no little dissatisfaction to the more bitter of the antagonists
of the Appellants, particularly because the Pope had referred to the
Bull not as expressing a final and immutable conclusion of the Church,
but simply as a papal utterance which was entitled to respectful
acceptance.

The Indexes of Innocent XIII and Clement XII contain the titles of
about one hundred works which had come into print as a result of
the controversies concerning the Bull. The list includes twenty-two
official publications (decrees, pastoral letters, appeals to Rome,
etc.) of the French bishops, and four edicts of the Parliament of
Paris. These official documents were for the greater part condemned
under the authority of the Inquisition, but in a few instances, the
condemnation was arrived at by a papal brief. In the case of Colbert,
Bishop of Montpellier, and of Caylus, Bishop of Auxerre, the entire
works were prohibited, on the ground, apparently, of certain utterances
in sympathy with the Appellants. The hundred prohibited works comprised
but a small proportion of the mass of literature in regard to the
controversy that came into print. For the purpose of meeting the
risk of the omission of controversial writings of importance, the
Inquisition had, as early as February, 1717, prohibited all writings in
which the Bull might be in any manner opposed or criticised, directly
or indirectly. This prohibition, as worded, appears to cover not only
works at that time in existence, but all others of the character
specified which might later be printed or written.

This general prohibition was incorporated by Benedict XIV in the
_Decreta Generalia_, ii., 61, with the addition of the following
classes: all books written in support of the conclusions presented in
the writings of Quesnel; all appeals from the authority of the Bull
to a general council; all resolutions and decisions coming from the
theological faculties or individual theologians or academies, in which
were presented any criticisms of the papal authority or of the policy
indicated in the Bull; all acts, decrees, letters, declarations and
statements of any kind in which, under the pretence of the explanation
of doctrines or of the analysis of the relations between the authority
of the pope and that of civil government, or under any pretence
whatsoever, the validity and conclusive authority of the Bull were in
any way brought into question. This prohibition, as worded, was made to
apply not only to writings at that time in existence but to any future
writings of the character specified.

In the Spanish Index of 1747, the Bull _Unigenitus_ is printed in full,
and all the writings of Quesnel are prohibited. The Spanish Index
contains, however, but a small portion of the long series of works
produced by the controversy which had been condemned in Rome. The
Spanish compilers added the titles of some few works which had escaped
the attention of the Roman Inquisition.

The Bull bearing the title _Unigenitus Dei Filius_ was signed by the
Pope (Innocent XII) on the 8th of September, 1713. It begins with the
statement that a work had been brought into print in Paris in 1699,
which it had been found necessary to condemn.

This work is entered in the Index under the title _Abrégé et
Testament_ (no reference is made by name to Quesnel). “On a first
examination, the earnest reader may easily be attracted by the
appearance of piety and of scholarship, but the volumes present in
fact, intermingled with accepted Catholic doctrines, a series of lies
and of pernicious errors.” The insidious teachings in these volumes
had misled not a few of the faithful and had even secured the approval
of certain of the French bishops. “It had therefore seemed to the
Holy See to be essential to make clear to the Church the serious and
pernicious nature of the doctrines that the writer of these volumes was
attempting to maintain; and to this end would be presented, with the
necessary interpretations, a series of propositions selected from the
text.” The Pope felt assured “that a thorough exposition of the errors
contained in these propositions should prove of service to the faithful
throughout the world and ought to be of particular service in bringing
to a close the unprofitable contests that had arisen in France. Such
an authoritative exposition had in fact been applied for by the French
bishops and by King Louis.” This statement is followed by the citation
(given in both French and Latin) of one hundred and one propositions,
with references in the margin to the pages of the original text from
which they had been cited. These propositions are there described
as “false, deceitful, injurious for pious ears, as tending to
undermine the beliefs of the faithful, the creed of the Church, and
the foundations of the civil power, as godless, blasphemous, and
schismatic. They have for their purpose the strengthening of the
influence of damnable heresies, and especially of those which have
emanated from the Jansenists.”

The specific condemnation of these particular propositions is not to
be understood as an approval by implication of the remaining text
of the book. The whole work is pernicious and the reading of it is
prohibited. The text itself of the New Testament that has been printed
in connection with the commentary has been corrupted in the most
abominable fashion. The reading, printing, or distribution of the book
brings upon the delinquent the penalty of the _excommunicatio latae
sententiae_ and the same penalty is made to apply, without further
specification, to all works in existence or hereafter produced which
may undertake the defence of the Quesnel volumes.

The Jesuit Daubenton, writing from Rome to Fénelon, says:

   “No work has ever received a more thorough, comprehensive,
   and conscientious examination. During a term of three years, a
   group of the most able theologians in Rome, representatives of
   the several schools of doctrine and of ecclesiastical thought,
   gave their labour to this examination. The examiners included
   Le Drou from the Augustinians, the master of the palace and the
   secretary of the Index Congregation from the Thomists, Palermo
   Santelia from the Scotists, Alfaro, for the Jesuits, the Bishop
   of Lipari, a Benedictine, for the school of Anselm, Castelli for
   the mission orders, etc.”

Writing to Fénelon after the publication of the Bull, Daubenton says:

   “Everybody appears to have taken action to prevent this Bull
   from being given out. A number of the cardinals have represented
   that there was risk of serious dissension in the Church.
   The Pope remained firm in his decision to meet the wishes
   of the King. The Bull is finally accepted by the cardinals
   only after a bitter contest. The Dominican cardinal, Ferrari,
   felt at one time assured that he would be able to prevent the
   publication.”[232]

Gieseler points out[233] that the one hundred and one propositions
include a number for which conclusive authority can be found in the
Scriptures themselves, while others are taken directly from the
writings of St. Augustine and of others of the Fathers. The Bull fails
to make clear, he says, the sense in which these are erroneous or
the grounds on which they are to be condemned. Fénelon, who was much
pleased at the publication of the Bull, writes that “the fear of a
possibly unjust excommunication ought not to be permitted to deter us
from doing our direct duty; but if the excommunication constitutes an
injustice only in the conception of the person concerned and the duty
is but putative or imaginary, or there is at least good ground for
doubt in regard to it, then is the proposition false, and all the more
dangerous because it bears the appearance of truth.”

The Jesuit Yves André (†1764) writes[234]:

   “I perceive here propositions which are bad in purpose and
   in conclusion, grouped together with others which represent
   manifest truths. These two classes are condemned together with
   a long string of invectives and no explanation is vouchsafed to
   us as to the varying grounds for the condemnation of statements
   which differ materially from each other.”

The Bull was referred by Louis XIV to a commission of bishops which
decided that it should be published accompanied by a pastoral letter
presenting explanations of the essential matters in question.

In March, 1714, the Sorbonne, after some stirring discussions,
accepted the Bull by a bare majority. In 1714, at the special instance
of the pope, the Congregation condemned the _Lettre Pastorale et
Mandement_ of Cardinal Noailles, Archbishop of Paris, as heretical
and tending to schism. Louis XIV had previously, in indignation at the
“Jansenist views” of the Cardinal, indicated by his opposition to the
Bull, forbidden him approach to the court.

In 1714, the King suggested to the pope the desirability of calling
a national council of the French Church, for the general object of
bringing to a close the remnants of the Jansenist dissensions, and
with the special purpose of bringing discipline to bear on Cardinal
Noailles. The pope gave favourable consideration to the plan, but the
death of the King, in September, 1715, prevented its being carried
out. The Duke of Orleans, who became Regent, was less sharply opposed
to the Jansenist group. He prohibited, in 1716, the printing of
certain censures that had been ordered by the Assembly of the Clergy
for treatises by du Fouillon on the Bull _Unigenitus_, and on
the Evidence of the True Faith. The Sorbonne, in modification of
its previous conclusions, made in December, 1715, a renewed protest
against the Bull, which protest was supported by the other theological
faculties of the kingdom. Thirty bishops declared to the Regent that
they had given their acceptance of the Bull only on condition that it
should be published with explanations and specifications.

Clement XI demanded the immediate submission, under penalty of
deposition, of Noailles and the protesting bishops. He declared that
the bishops named by the Regent would be confirmed only after they had
given in their assent to the publication and execution of the Bull;
and he suspended, in November, 1716, by a brief, the privileges that
had been conveyed by the Holy See to the Sorbonne. These briefs were,
however, refused confirmation and publication by the Regent and the
Parliament. During 1717, the Inquisition condemned, at the instance
of the pope, a series of statements and letters from the French
ecclesiastics, and of acts of the Parliament, and also certain decrees
of the Sorbonne. In October, 1717, the Regent commanded that there
should thereafter be absolute silence concerning these ecclesiastical
issues, and the Parliament condemned and prohibited certain writings,
including an appeal from Noailles and the decree of the Inquisition.
Under Innocent XIII, who, in 1721, succeeded Clement XI, the contest
and the controversies continued, and the lists of the Index were
swelled with the titles of the controversial monographs, letters, etc.

In the Netherlands, the opposition to the Bull _Unigenitus_ was
even stronger than in France, representing in fact a substantial
unanimity on the part of the clergy. Under the direction of De Bossu,
the successor of Precipiano as Archbishop of Mechlin, the Church of
Utrecht took the lead in the contest. A series of the writings of the
Netherland divines, which were important only in connection with the
pending question, were placed on the Index promptly after publication.

In Italy, the Bishop of Orvieto was, in 1719, denounced as an opponent
of the Bull, and was imprisoned. After he had formally recanted his
declaration, he was confined for the remainder of his life in a
monastery. In 1724, Innocent XIII was succeeded by Benedict XIII, a
Dominican and a Thomist. The new Pope took steps to allay, through
a more liberal interpretation of the Bull, the antagonisms that had
arisen. A Roman provincial council, called in 1725, arrived, however,
at the conclusion that the Bull must be respected by all the faithful.

In 1728, Noailles, at that time seventy-seven years old, apparently
wearied of the long struggle, recalled his previous protests and
accepted the Bull. He received from the Pope a jubilee Bull and letter
of congratulation. He died the year following. In 1730, the Government
secured the acceptance of the Bull on the part of the Sorbonne by means
of the deprivation, for forty-eight of its antagonists, of the right
to vote. This appears to have brought the matter to a close as far as
France was concerned.

In 1727, died François Paris, a deacon of Paris, who was credited
with having worked a series of miracles. Paris had been known in Rome
as an active opponent of the Bull _Unigenitus_. The Inquisition
took prompt action therefore in condemning, in 1731, the _Memoirs
of Paris_, and various records of his miracles. He was described
as a stubborn Jansenist, a schismatic, and a heretic, and his “false
miracles” as calculated to injure the faith of believers, and to render
them disobedient to the See.

Under Clement XII, were prohibited later a long series of writings
on the miracles. Under Benedict XIV, were placed upon the Index,
among other works on the same subject, a record of the life of Jean
Soanen and his _Testament Spirituel_; a narrative of the miracles
produced in the person of Marianne Pollet; the posthumous works of the
Bishop of Babylon, on the ground of the consideration given in these
to certain miracles that had been worked against the Archbishop of
Sens. In 1755, a convention of the French clergy gave consideration
to the question of the treatment to be given to the opponents of the
Bull, more particularly with reference to the administration of the
sacraments. The majority opinion was in favour of mild measures. The
conclusions were submitted to Rome, and the decision given by Benedict
XIV confirmed the policy of the mildest possible treatment of the
minority party.

In connection with the controversies concerning the Bull _Unigenitus_,
there arose in France further issues in regard to the relations
between the several orders of the clergy. Writers like Nicholas le
Gros (1675–1751) took the ground that the bishops had authority to
give binding decisions in regard to such matters as the acceptance of
a Bull, etc., only in connection with conclusions arrived at by the
whole body of the clergy. Another writer took the ground that between
bishops and priests there was no essential difference. A number of
these writings were formally censured by the Sorbonne and by diocesan
conventions, but no one of them found its way into the Index.

=3. Controversial Writings between 1665 and 1730 in Regard to
Theological Morality.=--In September of 1665 and May of 1666,
under edicts of Alexander VII, a long series (forty-five in all) of
propositions of the Casuists were condemned without specification of
the books in which these propositions had appeared. Similar edicts were
published later under Innocent XI and Alexander VIII. Matthaeus de
Moya, writing first under the name of Giumenus, undertook the defence
of the Jesuit Casuists against the doctrines of Spanish theologians,
chiefly Dominicans. This _Apologia_ of de Moya was, in 1665,
sharply censured by the Sorbonne and was prohibited in 1666 by the
Index Congregation, in 1675 by the Inquisition, and in 1680 by a
special brief of Innocent XI. In Spain, the work of De Moya, so far
from being prohibited, was held in general favour. In 1670 and 1672,
under Clement X, were prohibited writings by Fabri and Baron. Fabri was
one of the most noteworthy of the Dominican critics of the Jesuits,
and Baron was one of the most learned of the Jesuit Casuists of his
day. Neither of these volumes appears in the Spanish Index. One of the
more important of the works on theological morality by a Jesuit, was
printed in 1694 by Thyrsus Gonzalez, General of the Order, under the
title of _Probabilissimus_. This treatise is described as taking
strong ground against a number of the Jesuit contentions and theories.
Gonzalez had apparently undertaken to correct certain moral principles
maintained by his Order, principles which were in his judgment
erroneous. In 1705, a treatise of the Jesuit Balthazar Francolinus,
under the title of _Rigorismus_, was printed in Rome with the
approval of Clement XI; a number of replies to this were prohibited.

        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
