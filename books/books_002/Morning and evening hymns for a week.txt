Sunday Morning.

  “Unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise with
  healing in his wings.”
                                                      --MAL. iv. 2.


    Thou glorious Sun of Righteousness,
      On this day risen to set no more,
    Shine on me now to heal and bless,
      With brighter beams than e’er before.

    Shine on thy work of grace within,
      On each celestial blossom there:
    Destroy each bitter root of sin,
      And make thy garden fresh and fair.

    Shine on thy pure eternal word,
      Its mysteries to my soul reveal;
    And whether read, remembered, heard,
      O let it quicken, strengthen, heal.

    Shine on the temples of thy grace;
      In spotless robes thy priests be clad;
    Unveil the brightness of thy face;
      And make thy chosen people glad.

    Shine on those unseen things displayed
      To faith’s illuminated eye;
    And let their splendour cast a shade
      On every earthly vanity.

    Shine on the hearts of those most dear,
      Disperse each cloud ’twixt them and thee:
    Their glorious heavenward prospects clear;
      “Light in thy light,” oh, let them see!

    Shine on those friends for whom we mourn,
      Who know not yet thy healing ray:
    Quicken their souls, and bid them turn
      To thee, “the life, the truth, the way.”

    Shine on those tribes no country owns,
      On Judah once thy dwelling-place;
    “Thy servants think upon her stones,”
      And long to see her day of grace.

    Shine on the missionary’s home,
      Give him his heart’s desire to see:
    Collect thy scattered ones who roam;
      One fold, one Shepherd, let there be!

    Shine, till thy glorious beams shall chase
      The blinding film from every eye!
    Till every earthly dwelling-place
      Shall hail the day-spring from on high!

    Shine on, shine on, Eternal Sun!
      Pour richer floods of life and light,
    Till that bright Sabbath be begun--
      That glorious day which knows no night.

Sunday Evening.

  “I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day.”
                         --REV. i. 10.


    The Sabbath-day has reach’d its close!
    Yet, Saviour, ere I seek repose,
    Grant me the peace thy love bestows--
              Smile on my evening hour!

    Oh, heavenly Comforter, sweet guest!
    Hallow and calm my troubled breast,
    Weary I come to thee for rest--
              Smile on my evening hour!

    If ever I have found it sweet
    To worship at my Saviour’s feet,
    Now to my soul that bliss repeat--
              Smile on my evening hour!

    Let not the Gospel seed remain
    Unfruitful, or be lost again;
    Let heavenly dews descend like rain--
              Smile on my evening hour!

    Oh, ever present, ever nigh,
    Jesus, on thee I fix mine eye:
    Thou hear’st the contrite spirit’s sigh--
              Smile on my evening hour!

    My only intercessor thou,
    Mingle thy fragrant incense now
    With every prayer and every vow--
              Smile on my evening hour!

    And oh, when life’s short course shall end,
    And death’s dark shades around impend,
    My God, my everlasting Friend--
              Smile on my evening hour!

Monday Morning.

  “Blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.”
                                           --CANT. iv. 16.


    Now let our heavenly plants and flowers
      Diffuse a fragrance more Divine;
    Refreshed by the sweet Sabbath showers,
      With richer beauty they should shine.

    We have been wafted for a while
      Far, far away from this low scene;
    Been cheered by our Redeemer’s smile,
      Been suffered on his breast to lean.

    What has he taught us? what should be
      The fruit of intercourse so blest?
    O should not all around us see
      His image on our souls imprest?

    Within his ivory palace fair
      We entered a much-favoured train:
    Myrrh, aloes, cassia, filled the air,
      Our garments should the scent retain.

    And we should pass along the earth,
      Like birds that live upon the wing;
    Rise to the country of our birth,
      And on our way its anthems sing.

[Illustration]




Monday Evening.

  “Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace.”
                                        --HEB. iv. 16.


    There is a spot of consecrated ground,
    Where brightest hopes and holiest joys are found:
    ’Tis named (and Christians love the well-known sound)
                        The throne of grace.

    ’Tis here a calm retreat is always found:
    Perpetual sunshine gilds the sacred ground;
    Pure airs and heavenly odours breathe around
                        The throne of grace.

    While on this vantage-ground the Christian stands,
    His quickened eye a boundless view commands;
    Discovers fair abodes not made with hands--
                        Abodes of peace.

    Terrestrial objects, disenchanted there,
    Lose all their power to dazzle or ensnare;
    One only object then seems worth our care--
                        To win the race.

    This is the mount where Christ’s disciples see
    The glory of the incarnate Deity;
    ’Tis here they find it good indeed to be,
                        And view his face.

    A new creation here begins to rise;
    Fruits of the Spirit, flowers of Paradise,
    Watered from heaven, in full and sure supplies,
                        By streams of grace.

    Towards this blest spot the Spirit bends his ear,
    The fervent prayer, the contrite sigh to hear;
    To bid the mourner banish every fear,
                        And go in peace.

    Here may the comfortless and weary find
    One who can cure the sickness of the mind;
    One who delights the broken heart to bind--
                        The Prince of Peace.

    Saviour! the sinner’s friend, our hope, our all!
    Here teach us humbly at thy feet to fall;
    Here on thy name, with love and faith to call
                        For pardoning grace.

    Ne’er let the glory from this spot remove,
    Till, numbered with thy ransomed flock above,
    We cease to want, but never cease to love
                        The throne of grace.




Tuesday Morning.

  “Let us run with patience the race that is set before us.”
                                          --HEB. xii. 1.


    Immortal spirit! wake, arise!
    Think of thy home beyond the skies;
    Think of the work thou hast to do;
    Think of the heavenly prize in view.

    Shall thy poor tenement of clay
    Curtail thy flight, obstruct thy way?
    And shall the free and heaven-born soul
    Yield to the body’s base control?

    Oh, thoughtless slumberer, wake, arise!
    To God, to heaven, lift up thine eyes;
    Eternity’s vast ocean see,
    And but a step ’twixt it and thee.

    A clear, unerring chart is given
    To guide the traveller’s feet to heaven;
    With humble heart there seek thy way--
    None led by that can go astray.

    It will point out a holy path,
    Of self-denial, love, and faith;
    But strait and arduous though it be,
    My God, it leads to heaven and thee.

    Saviour! for mine this path I take,
    Through thee alone the choice I make;
    Nor one step onward can I go,
    Till thou both will and power bestow.

    To thee I now commit my way,
    My wants, my dangers, through the day,--
    Wilt thou my every want supply,
    And be in every danger nigh?

    Oh, let thy smile my solace be!
    ’Tis more than ought in life to me;
    Permit me not to slight thy grace,
    Or cause thee once to hide thy face.

    That blessed Spirit’s aid impart,
    Who can transform and cleanse my heart;
    Make the polluted fountain clear,
    Whose streams in words and acts appear.

    Teach me this day to keep in view
    The prize thy followers should pursue;
    To adorn thy doctrine, and to shed
    Fragrance and light where’er I tread.

    Saviour! I give myself to thee;
    My strength, my light, my guardian be:
    My earthly days thus let me spend,
    Till time, and life, and warfare end.

Tuesday Evening.

  “Now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.”
                                  --ROM. xiii. 11.


    Now one day’s journey less divides
    Me from the world where God resides;
    If I have walked by faith, in fear,
    A stranger and a pilgrim here:

    I’ve one day less my watch to keep,
    My foes to fear, my falls to weep:
    I’ve one day less to see within,
    Conflict, defeat, remorse, and sin.

    And, oh! reflect, my fainting soul,
    Thou’rt one stage nearer to the goal:
    Thou’rt one stage nearer to the shore,
    Where thou wilt grieve for sin no more.

    If the sweet presence of thy God
    To-day has cheered and blest thy road,
    Think what must be that glorious place,
    Where he will never hide his face.

    If thou hast oft been led astray,
    And mournfully review’st the day,
    Still strive the more that rest to attain,
    Where thou wilt never sin again.

    If thou hast mourned for friends endeared,
    Whose converse once thy journey cheered;
    Think that in heaven no cause will sever
    The bond which reunites for ever.

    Let every gift by God bestowed,
    Each kind refreshment on my road;
    Let every sorrow, hope, and fear,
    Incite my soul to persevere.

    And thou my only help and guide,
    Than whom I have no help beside;
    Whose eye beholds me when I fail,
    Whose arm supports when I prevail;

    Oh, hear me! grant what I implore;
    And if on earth I wake no more,
    Think on my last, my dying prayer;
    Hear it in heaven, fulfil it there!

    Since I on thee alone depend,
    Oh, guide me to my journey’s end;
    Then bear my soul o’er death’s dark wave,
    To realms of joy beyond the grave.

Wednesday Morning.

  “Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.”
                                 --MATT. xxvi. 41.


    “Christian! seek not yet repose;”
      Hear thy guardian angel say;
    Thou art in the midst of foes--
                      “Watch and pray!”

    Principalities and powers,
      Mustering their unseen array,
    Wait for thy unguarded hours--
                      “Watch and pray!”

    Gird thy heavenly armour on,
      Wear it ever, night and day;
    Ambush’d lies the evil one--
                      “Watch and pray!”

    Hear the victors who o’ercame,
      Still they mark each warrior’s way;
    All, with one sweet voice exclaim--
                      “Watch and pray!”

    Hear, above all, hear thy Lord,
      Him thou lovest to obey;
    Hide within thy heart his word--
                      “Watch and pray!”

    _Watch_, as if on that alone
      Hung the issue of the day;
    _Pray_, that help may be sent down--
                      “Watch and pray!”

[Illustration]




Wednesday Evening.

  “Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees.”
                                                   --HEB. xii. 12.


    O faint and feeble-hearted!
      Why thus cast down with fear?
    Fresh aid shall be imparted,
      Thy God unseen is near.

    His eye can never slumber,
      He marks thy cruel foes;
    Observes their strength, their number,
      And all thy weakness knows.

    Though heavy clouds of sorrow
      Make dark thy path to-day,
    There may shine forth to-morrow
      Once more a cheering ray.

    Doubts, griefs, and foes assailing,
      Conceal heaven’s fair abode;
    Yet now faith’s power prevailing
      Should stay thy mind on God.

[Illustration]




Thursday Morning.

  “He that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life.”
                            --PROV. xiii. 3.


    Guard well thy lips; none, none can know
    What evils from the tongue may flow;
    What guilt, what grief may be incurred
    By one incautious, hasty word.

    Be “slow to speak;” look well within,
    To check what there may lead to sin;
    And pray unceasingly for aid,
    Lest unawares, thou be betrayed.

    “Condemn not, judge not,”--not to man
    Is given his brother’s faults to scan;
    One task is thine, and one alone,--
    To search out and subdue thine own.

    Indulge no murmurings; oh, restrain
    Those lips so ready to complain!
    And, if they can be numbered, count
    Of one day’s mercies the amount.

    Shun vain discussions, trifling themes;
    Dwell not on earthly hopes or schemes;
    Let words of wisdom, meekness, love,
    Thy heart’s true renovation prove.

    Set God before thee; every word
    Thy lips pronounce by him is heard;
    Oh, could’st thou realise this thought,
    What care, what caution would be taught!

    Think on thy parting hour: ere long
    Th’ approach of death may chain thy tongue,
    And powerless all attempts be found,
    To articulate one meaning sound.

    “The time is short”--this day may be
    The very last assigned to thee:
    So speak that, should’st thou ne’er speak more,
    Thou may’st not this day’s words deplore.




Thursday Evening.

  “In everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your
  requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth
  all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ
  Jesus.”
                                                --PHILIP. iv. 6, 7.


    My God! is any hour so sweet,
    From blush of morn to evening-star,
    As that which calls me to thy feet--
                    The hour of prayer?

    Blest be that tranquil hour of morn,
    And blest that hour of solemn eve,
    When on the wings of prayer upborne,
                    The world I leave.

    For then a day-spring shines on me,
    Brighter than morn’s ethereal glow;
    And richer dews descend from thee
                    Than earth can know.

    Then is my strength by thee renewed;
    Then are my sins by thee forgiven;
    Then dost thou cheer my solitude
                    With hopes of heaven.

    Words cannot tell what blest relief
    Here for my every want I find;
    What strength for warfare, balm for grief;
                    What peace of mind.

    Hushed is each doubt--gone every fear,
    My spirit seems in heaven to stay;
    And e’en the penitential tear
                    Is wiped away.

    Oh, till I reach yon peaceful shore,
    No privilege so dear shall be,
    As thus my inmost soul to pour
                    In prayer to thee!




Friday Morning.

  “Acquaint thyself with him, and be at peace.”
                            --JOB xxii. 21.


    Art thou acquainted, oh my soul!
      With such a Saviour, such a Friend,
    Whose power can all events control,
      And from all evils can defend?

    Why art thou then opprest with fears?
      Knowledge of him should give thee peace;
    Should check these often-flowing tears,
      And bid these sad misgivings cease.

    Is it the _past_ that gives thee pain?
      Transgressions, falls, dost thou deplore?
    The atoning blood pleads not in vain,
      Thy God remembers them no more.

    Do _present_ troubles vex thy mind?
      Sufferings of body, mental care?
    In God a refuge thou wilt find;
      And oh, what sweet relief in prayer!

    Dost thou o’er friends much valued weep,
      Who seem in hopeless fetters bound?
    Christ will seek out his wandering sheep--
      Those who seem lost will then be found.

    Dost thou the unknown _future_ dread?
      Thy passage through death’s awful vale?
    E’en there shall light around be shed
      Thy God’s sure promise cannot fail.

    Dost thou with dread still greater, shrink
      From pain for those on earth most dear;
    And oft with sickening anguish think
      On all they yet may suffer here?

    Oh faithless, unbelieving heart!
      So slow to trust the tenderest Friend:
    Who then will needful strength impart,--
      Who “loving, loves unto the end.”

    No longer doubt, nor fear, nor grieve,
      Nor on uncertain evils dwell:
    Past, present, future, calmly leave
      To him who will do all things well.

[Illustration]




Friday Evening.

  “Having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far
  better.”
                                            --PHILIP. i. 23.


    Let me be with thee where thou art!
      My Saviour, my eternal rest!
    Then only with this longing heart
      Be fully and for ever blest.

    Let me be with thee where thou art!
      Thy unveiled glory to behold;
    Then only will this wandering heart
      Cease to be treacherous, faithless, cold.

    Let me be with thee where thou art!
      Where spotless saints thy name adore;
    Then only will this sinful heart
      Be evil and defiled no more.

    Let me be with thee where thou art!
      Where none can die, where none remove;
    There neither life nor death will part
      Me from thy presence and thy love.

Saturday Morning.

  “Who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me?”
                                        --JER. xxx. 21.


    This is the day to tune with care
      Each unseen chord within:
    Would we for Sabbaths well prepare,
      To-day we should begin.

    Before the Majesty of Heaven
      To-morrow we appear;
    No honour half so great is given,
      Throughout man’s sojourn here.

    Yet if his heart be not prepared,
      His soul not meetly drest,
    In vain that honour will be shared,--
      No smile will greet the guest.

    We must beforehand lay aside
      Our own polluted dress,
    And wear the robe of Jesu’s bride,--
      His spotless righteousness.

    We must forsake this world below,
      Forget all earthly things;
    Strive with a seraph’s love to glow,
      And soar on angel wings.

    The altar must be cleansed to-day,
      Meet for the offered Lamb;
    The wood in order we must lay,
      And wait to-morrow’s flame.

    Lord of the Sacrifice we bring,
      To thee our hopes aspire;
    Our Prophet, our High-Priest, and King,
      Send down the sacred fire.

[Illustration]




Saturday Evening.

  “Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still.”
                                            --PS. iv. 4.


    Another portion of the span
    Assigned to transitory man
      Has now for ever flown;
    And ere I taste the sweet repose
    My heavenly Guardian’s care bestows,
      I kneel before his throne.

    God of my life! to thee I pray;
    The passing pilgrim of a day,
      Soon, soon to sleep in death,--
    Let me not spend unthinkingly,
    These moments that so quickly fly,
      Shortened by every breath.

    Ere yet that hallowed morn appear,
    Given to recruit the soul and cheer--
      Pour down thy light divine;
    That while my progress I retrace,
    Since last I hailed the day of grace,
      Its beams within may shine.

    Oh, has that rapid, ceaseless tide,
    Of which the waves so noiseless glide,
      Borne me towards heaven, my home;
    As surely as each day, each hour,
    Has borne me with resistless power,
      On to the silent tomb?

    Have my affections soared above?
    And has my Saviour’s wondrous love
      Constrained me, day by day,
    For him to act, to think, to speak?
    His glory as my end to seek,
      His Spirit to obey?

    Have I his constant influence felt?
    And has his holy word so “dwelt
      Richly” my heart within,
    That outward faults have been subdued,
    And inward hidden thoughts renewed,
      Cleansed from the taint of sin?

    Lord! if my only answer now
    Must be these silent tears that flow,
      For days not given to thee;
    Still let a holier life begin--
    A life not thus defaced by sin--
      If I to-morrow see.

    Then let thy word its power exert,
    To quicken, cleanse, transform my heart,
      Within thy house of prayer;
    Or if that boon be still denied,
    With me in solitude abide,
      And make my wants thy care.

    Now let me peacefully lie down,
    Cleansed, pardoned, numbered with thine own,
      While strengthening sleep is given;
    Then let the auspicious Sabbath bring
    Peace, gladness, healing on its wing,
      And rest like that of heaven!

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
