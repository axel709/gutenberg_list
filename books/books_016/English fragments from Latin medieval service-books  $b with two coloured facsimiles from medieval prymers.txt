Transcriber’s Note:

This e-text includes a few characters that will only display in UTF-8
(Unicode) text readers, including

    ȝ (yogh)
    þ (thorn)
    ħ (Latin small letter h with stroke)

If any of these characters do not display properly, or if the quotation
marks in this paragraph appear as garbage, make sure your text reader’s
“character set” or “file encoding” is set to Unicode (UTF-8). You may
also need to change the default font.

_Italics and other text markings:_

Italicized letters within words, representing expanded abbreviations, are
shown in the e-text with braces (“curly brackets”): Pat{er} n{oste}r.
Readers who find this added information distracting may globally delete
all braces; they are not used for any other purpose. Whole-word italics
are shown in the usual way with _lines_, and boldface or blackletter type
with =marks=.

_Page Layout:_

In the original book, the EETS catalogue material was wrapped around the
body of the text, with pp. 1-6 at the start of the book and 7-12 at the
end. This has all been moved to the end.

_Headnotes_ appeared at the top of some pages, like subsidiary chapter
headings. They have been retained and moved to the beginning of the most
appropriate paragraph.

_Footnotes_ were numbered separately for each page. In this e-text,
footnotes are numbered for each section, and grouped at the end of the
section. In one section, there are two types of footnotes, referring to
two parallel texts. One type of these footnotes uses numbers, the other
uses letters a, b, c etc, as in the original book. Footnote markers
[1]like so[1] denote that the footnote applies to the passage of text
that appears between the markers; the footnote itself is numbered [1-1].

NOTE.


The two coloured facsimiles of this little pamphlet explain themselves.
The Manual, which was the medieval priest’s handbook for the services of
Baptism, Marriage, Visitation of the Sick, Burial, etc., is virtually the
only one of the medieval Latin service-books which contained invariably a
certain proportion of its text in English. The text of the English varies
in a measure in different MSS.

THE GENERAL SENTENCE.

This form of excommunication, read four times a year, has been printed
from an excellent text in the Early English Text Society’s volume
entitled _Instructions for Parish Priests_. The General Sentence is
commonly found in the printed or later Manuals, but appears to have had
no distinct place in any medieval service-book.




_Mr. Henry Littlehales, who, in 1898, gave the Chaucer Society his ~Notes
on the Road from London to Canterbury~, no. 30 of the Society’s Second
Series, and who also edited for the Early English Text Society “The
Prymer, or Lay Folk’s Prayer-Book,” from a Cambridge University MS. ab.
1420, nos. 105, 109 in the Original Series, has kindly given the Chaucer
Society 250 copies of each of the Facsimiles of two Illuminated pages in
Fifteenth-Century MS. Prymers in the British Museum._

_They are issued herewith, but are not made one of the Society’s
publications, because we cannot undertake to reproduce them when the
present copies run out. Every Member will decide for himself whether he
puts these Facsimiles into one of the Society’s Texts, or keeps them
apart in his picture-album._

_All will join in thanking Mr. Littlehales for his pretty and welcome
gift._

The Early English Text Society was started by Dr. Furnivall in 1864 for
the purpose of bringing the mass of Old English Literature within the
reach of the ordinary student, and of wiping away the reproach under
which England had long rested, of having felt little interest in the
monuments of her early language and life.

On the starting of the Society, so many Texts of importance were at once
taken in hand by its Editors, that it became necessary in 1867 to open,
besides the _Original Series_ with which the Society began, an _Extra
Series_ which should be mainly devoted to fresh editions of all that is
most valuable in printed MSS. and Caxton’s and other black-letter books,
though first editions of MSS. will not be excluded when the convenience
of issuing them demands their inclusion in the Extra Series.

During the thirty-nine years of the Society’s existence, it has produced,
with whatever shortcomings, an amount of good solid work for which all
students of our Language, and some of our Literature, must be grateful,
and which has rendered possible the beginnings (at least) of proper
Histories and Dictionaries of that Language and Literature, and has
illustrated the thoughts, the life, the manners and customs of our
forefathers and foremothers.

But the Society’s experience has shown the very small number of those
inheritors of the speech of Cynewulf, Chaucer, and Shakspere, who care
two guineas a year for the records of that speech. ‘Let the dead past
bury its dead’ is still the cry of Great Britain and her Colonies, and
of America, in the matter of language. The Society has never had money
enough to produce the Texts that could easily have been got ready for
it; and many Editors are now anxious to send to press the work they have
prepared. The necessity has therefore arisen for trying to increase the
number of the Society’s members, and to induce its well-wishers to help
it by gifts of money, either in one sum or by instalments. The Committee
trust that every Member will bring before his or her friends and
acquaintances the Society’s claims for liberal support. Until all Early
English MSS. are printed, no proper History of our Language or Social
Life is possible.

The Subscription to the Society, which constitutes membership, is £1
1_s._ a year for the ORIGINAL SERIES, and £1 1_s._ for the EXTRA SERIES,
due in advance on the 1st of JANUARY, and should be paid by Cheque,
Postal Order, or Money-Order, crost ‘Union Bank of London,’ to the
Hon. Secretary, W. A. DALZIEL, Esq., 67, Victoria Rd., Finsbury Park,
London, N. Members who want their Texts posted to them, must add to their
prepaid Subscriptions 1_s._ for the Original Series, and 1_s._ for the
Extra Series, yearly. The Society’s Texts are also sold separately at
the prices put after them in the Lists; but Members can get back-Texts
at one-third less than the List-prices by sending the cash for them in
advance to the Hon. Secretary.

☞ The Society intends to complete, as soon as its funds will allow, the
Reprints of its out-of-print Texts of the year 1866, and also of nos. 20,
26 and 33. Prof. Skeat has finisht _Partenay_; Dr. McKnight of Ohio _King
Horn_ and _Floris and Blancheflour_; and Dr. Furnivall his _Political,
Religious and Love Poems_ and _Myrc’s Duties of a Parish Priest_. Dr.
Otto Glauning has undertaken _Seinte Marherete_; and Dr. Furnivall has
_Hali Meidenhad_ in type. As the cost of these Reprints, if they were
not needed, would have been devoted to fresh Texts, the Reprints will
be sent to all Members in lieu of such Texts. Though called ‘Reprints,’
these books are new editions, generally with valuable additions, a fact
not noticed by a few careless receivers of them, who have complained
that they already had the volumes. As the Society’s copies of the
_Facsimile of the Epinal MS._ issued as an Extra Volume in 1883 are
exhausted, Mr. J. H. Hessels, M.A., of St. John’s Coll., Cambridge, has
kindly undertaken an edition of the MS. for the Society. This will be
substituted for the Facsimile as an 1883 book, but will be also issued to
all the present Members.

[Sidenote: _Original and Extra Series Books 1903-1906._]

=July 1904.= The Original-Series Texts for 1903 were: No. 122, Part II of
_The Laud MS. Troy-Book_, edited from the unique Laud MS. 595 by Dr. J.
E. Wülfing; and No. 123, Part II of Robert of Brunne’s _Handlyng Synne_,
and its French original, ed. by Dr. F. J. Furnivall.

The Extra-Series Texts for 1903 are to be: No. LXXXVIII, _Le Morte
Arthur_, in 8-line stanzas, re-edited from the unique MS. Harl. 2252,
by Prof. J. Douglas Bruce (issued), No. LXXXIX, Lydgate’s _Reason and
Sensuality_, edited by Dr. Ernst Sieper, Part II, and No. XC, _English
Fragments from Latin Medieval Service-Books_, edited, and given to the
Society, by Mr. Henry Littlehales.

The Original-Series Texts for 1904 will be No. 124, t. Hen. V,
_Twenty-six Political and other Poems_ from the Digby MS. 102, &c.,
edited by Dr. J. Kail, and No. 125, Part I of the _Medieval Records of
a London City Church_ (St. Mary-at-Hill), A.D. 1420-1559, copied and
edited by Mr. Henry Littlehales from the Church Records in the Guildhall,
the cost of the setting and corrections of the text being generously
borne by its Editor. This book will show the income and outlay of the
church; the drink provided for its Palm-Sunday players, its officers’
excursions into Kent and Essex, its dealing with the Plague, the disposal
of its goods at the Reformation, &c., &c., and will help our members to
realize the church-life of its time. The third Text will be Part I of
_An Alphabet of Tales_, a very interesting collection, englisht in the
Northern Dialect, about 1440, from the Latin _Alphabetum Narrationum_ by
Etienne de Bésançon, and edited by Mrs. M. M. Banks from the unique MS.
in the King’s Library in the British Museum; the above-named three texts
are now ready for issue. Those for 1905 and 1906 will probably be chosen
from Part II of the _Exeter Book_—Anglo-Saxon Poems from the unique
MS. in Exeter Cathedral—re-edited by Israel Gollancz, M.A.; Part II of
Prof. Dr. Holthausen’s _Vices and Virtues_; Part II of _Jacob’s Well_,
edited by Dr. Brandeis; the Alliterative _Siege of Jerusalem_, edited
by the late Prof. Dr. E. Kölbing and Prof. Dr. Kaluza; an Introduction
and Glossary to the _Minor Poems of the Vernon MS._ by H. Hartley, M.A.;
Alain Chartier’s _Quadrilogue_, edited from the unique MS. Univ. Coll.
Oxford MS. No. 85, by Mr. J. W. H. Atkins of Owen’s College; a Northern
Verse _Chronicle of England_ to 1327 A.D., in 42,000 lines, about 1420
A.D., edited by M. L. Perrin, B.A.; Prof. Bruce’s Introduction to _The
English Conquest of Ireland_, Part II; and Dr. Furnivall’s edition of
the _Lichfield Gilds_, which is all printed, and waits only for the
Introduction, that Prof. E. C. K. Gonner has kindly undertaken to write
for the book. Canon Wordsworth of Marlborough has given the Society a
copy of the Leofric Canonical Rule, Latin and Anglo-Saxon, Parker MS.
191, C. C. C. Cambridge, and Prof. Napier will edit it, with a fragment
of the englisht Capitula of Bp. Theodulf. The _Coventry Leet Book_
is being copied for the Society by Miss M. Dormer Harris—helpt by a
contribution from the Common Council of the City,—and will be publisht by
the Society (Miss Harris editing), as its contribution to our knowledge
of the provincial city life of the 15th century.

Dr. Brie of Berlin has undertaken to edit the prose _Brut_ or _Chronicle
of Britain_ attributed to Sir John Mandeville, and printed by Caxton. He
has already examined more than 100 English MSS. and several French ones,
to get the best text, and find out its source.

The Extra-Series Texts for 1904 will be chosen from Lydgate’s
_DeGuilleville’s Pilgrimage of the Life of Man_, Part III, edited by
Miss Locock; Dr. M. Konrath’s re-edition of _William of Shoreham’s
Poems_, Part II; Dr. E. A. Kock’s edition of Lovelich’s _Merlin_ from the
unique MS. in Corpus Christi Coll., Cambridge; the _Macro Plays_, edited
from Mr. Gurney’s MS. by Dr. Furnivall and A. W. Pollard, M.A.; Prof.
Erdmann’s re-edition of Lydgate’s _Siege of Thebes_ (issued also by the
Chaucer Society); Miss Rickert’s re-edition of the Romance of _Emare_;
Prof. I. Gollancz’s re-edition of two Alliterative Poems, _Winner and
Waster_, &c., ab. 1360, lately issued for the Roxburghe Club; Dr. Norman
Moore’s re-edition of _The Book of the Foundation of St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital, London_, from the unique MS. ab. 1425, which gives an account
of the Founder, Rahere, and the miraculous cures wrought at the Hospital;
_The Craft of Nombrynge_, with other of the earliest englisht Treatises
on Arithmetic, edited by R. Steele, B.A.; and Miss Warren’s two-text
edition of _The Dance of Death_ from the Ellesmere and other MSS.

These Extra-Series Texts ought to be completed by their Editors: the
Second Part of the prose Romance of _Melusine_—Introduction, with ten
facsimiles of the best woodblocks of the old foreign black-letter
editions, Glossary, &c., by A. K. Donald, B.A. (now in India); and a
new edition of the famous Early-English Dictionary (English and Latin),
_Promptorium Parvulorum_, from the Winchester MS., ab. 1440 A.D.: in
this, the Editor, the Rev. A. L. Mayhew, M.A., will follow and print his
MS. not only in its arrangement of nouns first, and verbs second, under
every letter of the Alphabet, but also in its giving of the flexions of
the words. The Society’s edition will thus be the first modern one that
really represents its original, a point on which Mr. Mayhew’s insistence
will meet with the sympathy of all our Members.

[Sidenote: _Texts preparing: The Texts for 1906, 1907 &c._]

The Texts for the Extra Series in 1906 and 1907 will be chosen from _The
Three Kings’ Sons_, Part II, the Introduction &c. by Prof. Dr. Leon
Kellner; Part II of _The Chester Plays_, re-edited from the MSS., with a
full collation of the formerly missing Devonshire MS., by Mr. G. England
and Dr. Matthews; the Parallel-Text of the only two MSS. of the _Owl and
Nightingale_, edited by Mr. G. F. H. Sykes (at press); Prof. Jespersen’s
editions of John Hart’s _Orthographie_ (MS. 1551 A.D.; blackletter 1569),
and _Method to teach Reading_, 1570; Deguilleville’s _Pilgrimage of the
Sowle_, in English prose, edited by Prof. Dr. L. Kellner. (For the three
prose versions of _The Pilgrimage of the Life of Man_—two English, one
French—an Editor is wanted.) Members are askt to realise the fact that
the Society has now 50 years’ work on its Lists,—at its present rate of
production,—and that there is from 100 to 200 more years’ work to come
after that. The year 2000 will not see finisht all the Texts that the
Society ought to print. The need of more Members and money is pressing.
Offers of help from willing Editors have continually to be declined
because the Society has no funds to print their Texts.

An urgent appeal is hereby made to Members to increase the list of
Subscribers to the E. E. Text Society. It is nothing less than a scandal
that the Hellenic Society should have nearly 1000 members, while the
Early English Text Society has not 300!

[Sidenote: _Deguilleville._]

Before his death in 1895, Mr. G. N. Currie was preparing an edition of
the 15th and 16th century Prose Versions of Guillaume de Deguilleville’s
_Pilgrimage of the Life of Man_, with the French prose version by Jean
Gallopes, from Lord Aldenham’s MS., he having generously promist to pay
the extra cost of printing the French text, and engraving one or two
of the illuminations in his MS. But Mr. Currie, when on his deathbed,
charged a friend to burn _all_ his MSS. which lay in a corner of his
room, and unluckily all the E. E. T. S.’s copies of the Deguilleville
prose versions were with them, and were burnt with them, so that the
Society will be put to the cost of fresh copies, Mr. Currie having died
in debt.

Guillaume de Deguilleville, monk of the Cistercian abbey of Chaalis, in
the diocese of Senlis, wrote his first verse _Pèlerinaige de l’Homme_
in 1330-1 when he was 36.[1] Twenty-five (or six) years after, in 1355,
he revised his poem, and issued a second version of it,[2] a revision
of which was printed ab. 1500. Of the prose representative of the first
version, 1330-1, a prose Englishing, about 1430 A.D., was edited by Mr.
Aldis Wright for the Roxburghe Club in 1869, from MS. Ff. 5. 30 in the
Cambridge University Library. Other copies of this prose English are
in the Hunterian Museum, Glasgow, Q. 2. 25; Sion College, London; and
the Laud Collection in the Bodleian, no. 740.[3] A copy in the Northern
dialect is MS. G. 21, in St. John’s Coll., Cambridge, and this is the
MS. which will be edited for the E. E. Text Society. The Laud MS. 740
was somewhat condenst and modernised, in the 17th century, into MS. Ff.
6. 30, in the Cambridge University Library:[4] “The Pilgrime or the
Pilgrimage of Man in this World,” copied by Will. Baspoole, whose copy
“was verbatim written by Walter Parker, 1645, and from thence transcribed
by G. G. 1649; and from thence by W. A. 1655.” This last copy may have
been read by, or its story reported to, Bunyan, and may have been the
groundwork of his _Pilgrim’s Progress_. It will be edited for the E.
E. T. Soc., its text running under the earlier English, as in Mr.
Herrtage’s edition of the _Gesta Romanorum_ for the Society. In February
1464,[5] Jean Gallopes—a clerk of Angers, afterwards chaplain to John,
Duke of Bedford, Regent of France—turned Deguilleville’s first verse
_Pèlerinaige_ into a prose _Pèlerinage de la vie humaine_.[6] By the
kindness of Lord Aldenham, as above mentiond, Gallopes’s French text will
be printed opposite the early prose northern Englishing in the Society’s
edition.

The Second Version of Deguilleville’s _Pèlerinaige de l’Homme_, A.D. 1355
or -6, was englisht in verse by Lydgate in 1426. Of Lydgate’s poem, the
larger part is in the Cotton MS. Vitellius C. xiii (leaves 2-308). This
MS. leaves out Chaucer’s englishing of Deguilleville’s _A B C_ or _Prayer
to the Virgin_, of which the successive stanzas start with A, B, C, and
run all thro’ the alphabet; and it has 2 main gaps, besides many small
ones from the tops of leaves being burnt in the Cotton fire. All these
gaps (save the A B C) have been fild up from the Stowe MS. 952 (which old
John Stowe completed) and from the end of the other imperfect MS. Cotton,
Tiberius A vii. Thanks to the diligence of the old Elizabethan tailor
and manuscript-lover, a complete text of Lydgate’s poem can be given,
though that of an inserted theological prose treatise is incomplete. The
British Museum French MSS. (Harleian 4399,[7] and Additional 22,937[8]
and 25,594[9]) are all of the First Version.

Besides his first _Pèlerinaige de l’homme_ in its two versions,
Deguilleville wrote a second, “de l’ame separee du corps,” and a third,
“de nostre seigneur Iesus.” Of the second, a prose Englishing of 1413,
_The Pilgrimage of the Sowle_ (with poems by Hoccleve, already printed
for the Society with that author’s _Regement of Princes_), exists in the
Egerton MS. 615,[10] at Hatfield, Cambridge (Univ. Kk. 1. 7, and Caius),
Oxford (Univ. Coll. and Corpus), and in Caxton’s edition of 1483. This
version has ‘somewhat of addicions’ as Caxton says, and some shortenings
too, as the maker of both, the first translater, tells us in the MSS.
Caxton leaves out the earlier englisher’s interesting Epilog in the
Egerton MS. This prose englishing of the _Sowle_ will be edited for the
Society by Prof. Dr. Leon Kellner after that of the _Man_ is finisht, and
will have Gallopes’s French opposite it, from Lord Aldenham’s MS., as his
gift to the Society. Of the Pilgrimage of Jesus, no englishing is known.

[Sidenote: _Anglo-Saxon Psalters._]

As to the MS. Anglo-Saxon Psalters, Dr. Hy. Sweet has edited the oldest
MS., the Vespasian, in his _Oldest English Texts_ for the Society, and
Mr. Harsley has edited the latest, c. 1150, Eadwine’s Canterbury Psalter.
The other MSS., except the Paris one, being interlinear versions,—some
of the Roman-Latin redaction, and some of the Gallican,—Prof. Logeman
has prepared for press, a Parallel-Text edition of the first twelve
Psalms, to start the complete work. He will do his best to get the Paris
Psalter—tho’ it is not an interlinear one—into this collective edition;
but the additional matter, especially in the Verse-Psalms, is very
difficult to manage. If the Paris text cannot be parallelised, it will
form a separate volume. The Early English Psalters are all independent
versions, and will follow separately in due course.

[Sidenote: _More Money wanted._]

Through the good offices of the Examiners, some of the books for the
Early-English Examinations of the University of London will be chosen
from the Society’s publications, the Committee having undertaken to
supply such books to students at a large reduction in price. The net
profits from these sales will be applied to the Society’s Reprints.

Members are reminded that _fresh Subscribers are always wanted_, and
that the Committee can at any time, on short notice, send to press an
additional Thousand Pounds’ worth of work.

[Sidenote: _Saints’ Lives._]

The Subscribers to the Original Series must be prepared for the issue
of the whole of the Early English _Lives of Saints_, sooner or later.
The Society cannot leave out any of them, even though some are dull. The
Sinners would doubtless be much more interesting. But in many Saints’
Lives will be found valuable incidental details of our forefathers’
social state, and all are worthful for the history of our language. The
Lives may be lookt on as the religious romances or story-books of their
period.

The Standard Collection of Saints’ Lives in the Corpus and Ashmole MSS.,
the Harleian MS. 2277, &c. will repeat the Laud set, our No. 87, with
additions, and in right order. (The foundation MS. (Laud 108) had to be
printed first, to prevent quite unwieldy collations.) The Supplementary
Lives from the Vernon and other MSS. will form one or two separate
volumes.

Besides the Saints’ Lives, Trevisa’s englishing of _Bartholomæus de
Proprietatibus Rerum_, the mediæval Cyclopædia of Science, &c., will
be the Society’s next big undertaking. Dr. R. von Fleischhacker will
edit it. Prof. Napier of Oxford, wishing to have the whole of our MS.
Anglo-Saxon in type, and accessible to students, will edit for the
Society all the unprinted and other Anglo-Saxon Homilies which are not
included in Thorpe’s edition of Ælfric’s prose,[11] Dr. Morris’s of the
Blickling Homilies, and Prof. Skeat’s of Ælfric’s Metrical Homilies.
The late Prof. Kölbing left complete his text, for the Society, of the
_Ancren Riwle_, from the best MS., with collations of the other four, and
this will be edited for the Society by Dr. Thümmler. Mr. Harvey means to
prepare an edition of the three MSS. of the _Earliest English Metrical
Psalter_, one of which was edited by the late Mr. Stevenson for the
Surtees Society.

Members of the Society will learn with pleasure that its example has been
followed, not only by the Old French Text Society which has done such
admirable work under its founders Profs. Paul Meyer and Gaston Paris, but
also by the Early Russian Text Society, which was set on foot in 1877,
and has since issued many excellent editions of old MS. Chronicles, &c.

Members will also note with pleasure the annexation of large tracts of
our Early English territory by the important German contingent, the
late Professors Zupitza and Kölbing, the living Hausknecht, Einenkel,
Haenisch, Kaluza, Hupe, Adam, Holthausen, Schick, Herzfeld, Brandeis,
Sieper, Konrath, Wülfing, &c. Scandinavia has also sent us Prof. Erdmann
and Dr. E. A. Kock; Holland, Prof. H. Logeman, who is now working in
Belgium; France, Prof. Paul Meyer—with Gaston Paris as adviser (alas,
now dead);—Italy, Prof. Lattanzi; Austria, Dr. von Fleischhacker; while
America is represented by the late Prof. Child, by Dr. Mary Noyes
Colvin, Miss Rickert, Profs. Mead, McKnight, Triggs, Perrin, &c. The
sympathy, the ready help, which the Society’s work has cald forth from
the Continent and the United States, have been among the pleasantest
experiences of the Society’s life, a real aid and cheer amid all troubles
and discouragements. All our Members are grateful for it, and recognise
that the bond their work has woven between them and the lovers of
language and antiquity across the seas is one of the most welcome results
of the Society’s efforts.

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
